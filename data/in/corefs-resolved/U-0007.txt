Okay , this is tape 02.25.04-CL . Today 's the 25th , right ?
THE 24TH .
February-is 2004 February THE 24TH , 2004 .
WE 're in Pembroke , NORTH CAROLINA , interviewing MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR .
THE INTERVIEWERS are MALINDA MAYNOR and WILLIE LOWERY .
So , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , start where YOU think is appropriate to tell WE YOU THE FIRST experiences as an activist here in ROBESON COUNTY , YOU INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED , THAT WAS IDENTIFYING AS TUSCARORA AT THAT TIME .
In 1968 , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR began to wonder , what kind of PEOPLE are WE .
WE look different , each one of us .
There 's not many of WE looks alike .
A SPRINKLE 're A SPRINKLE .
Some got , A LITTLE BOY know , red hair , and some got blonde hair , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , man , what kind of PEOPLE , where 'd WE come from ? MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR never really knew , always heard WE were THE LUMBEES .
Then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got to doing some research , and find out MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR there was a tremendous amount of different tribes among WE .
The Eno , the Cherokee , VERMON LOCKLEAR-THE HATTERAS TUSCARORA , VERMON LOCKLEAR 'S GROUP , and different tribes .
And then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , man , how can WE be LUMBEE PEOPLE and have all this different blood of Indians among WE .
And then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went to doing SOME RESEARCH with the encyclopedia , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR found out that THE PEOPLE IN THE EASTERN PART OF NORTH CAROLINA were THE WORD TUSCARORA people .
Migrated , THE PEOPLE IN THE EASTERN PART OF NORTH CAROLINA were here , and then some left and some went to New York and some stayed here .
Now , all of the Indian people at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE did n't leave here .
Some migrated up there , and some stayed here and hid in the swamps .
Then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got really interested , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to find out about THE LUMBEE BILL .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went to WASHINGTON DC , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR sat down and talked to ALTON LENNON . , and ALTON LENNON . gave MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR a copy of THE LUMBEE BILL .
Talked to who ?
ALTON LENNON .
ALTON LENNON . was ALTON LENNON . .
ALTON LENNON . was from WILMINGTON .
And ALTON LENNON . says , ALTON LENNON . give MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR A COPY OF LUMBEE BILL , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR read A COPY OF LUMBEE BILL .
In THE LUMBEE BILL AT THAT TIME , THE LUMBEE BILL AT THAT TIME said , LUMBEE PEOPLE hereafter will be recognized as LUMBEE INDIANS .
In other words , LUMBEE PEOPLE would have THE NAME AS LUMBEE INDIANS , but LUMBEE PEOPLE will have no rights as INDIAN PEOPLE .
And that kind of threw MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR off .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , man , what kind of-in other words , WE 're WE .
And ALTON LENNON . told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , ALTON LENNON . come down here and ALTON LENNON . and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR met at THE OLD FOUNDRY .
And ALTON LENNON . told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , `` Now , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , what THE OLD FOUNDRY is now , LUMBEE PEOPLE are very difficult to work with .
LUMBEE PEOPLE will fight EACH OTHER and WE 've tried to work with LUMBEE PEOPLE , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 've not been able to do anything with LUMBEE PEOPLE . ''
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` Well , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR want to help LUMBEE PEOPLE . ''
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME , OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME needed THE FOOD STAMPS , OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME needed kerosene , OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME needed clothing .
A LOT OF THEM could n't read and write .
And OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME did n't understand THE SYSTEM .
OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME 'd get lost in THE SYSTEM .
So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR want to start A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR want to see if MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR could help .
So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR give up MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR job , selling insurance , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR lost MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR home , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR lost MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR trailer , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR lost MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR car , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR lost everything .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR moved in A OLD HOUSE over near Midway , and then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR started organizing .
We 'd meet once ALMOST EVERY WEEK .
And THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT would help MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR by bringing MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR food to eat .
THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT would pay MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR light bill at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , and THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT bought MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR some furniture .
THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT gave MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR a stove , and THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT give MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR clothing .
There 's A MAN IN FAYETTEVILLE , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'll never forget A MAN IN FAYETTEVILLE , A MAN IN FAYETTEVILLE name is Mr. Champ Goins , give MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR an old 1964 beat up Plymouth .
And somebody had hit FAYETTEVILLE in the rear and knocked the rear end slam up there .
So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR began to organize , and we began to go down to THE FOOD STAMP PLACE .
A LOT OF PEOPLE would go in there , and PEOPLE 'd apply for THE FOOD STAMPS , and it would be three months before PEOPLE 'd hear from the application .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` BOY , YOU 'LL GET -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- is wrong . ''
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` THIS is just wrong . ''
So WE , at that time WE began to organize , WE began to march against THE SYSTEM down there .
SOCIAL SERVICES ?
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES .
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES . was DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES . .
Now , tell MALINDA MAYNOR who was DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES . ?
THE LOW INCOME CLASS PEOPLE FROM THE COUNTY HERE .
INDIAN PEOPLE primarily .
Were INDIAN PEOPLE being THE WORD TUSCARORA as well ?
Yeah .
WE studied the history books at NIGHT during THE PROCESS , and BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL , BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL agreed to draw up a charter .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR knew BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL by , BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL come down here and met with MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE WE were really getting in THE NEWSPAPER A GREAT DEAL .
The Robesonian was very , very nice to WE , because WE had A GUY FROM TEXAS , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 've forgot A GUY FROM TEXAS name , but anyway A GUY FROM TEXAS began to write articles ALMOST EVERY WEEK .
And the more A GUY FROM TEXAS 'd write , the more MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR would get involved .
And Mr. MR. JIM CHAVIS . , what was A GUY FROM TEXAS name ? DADDY 'S , MISS DOROTHY 'S daddy , what was A GUY FROM TEXAS name ? Uncle Zimmie 's boy .
ED ? I MEAN NOT ED -
ED ? I MEAN NOT ED - father .
James , Jim .
MR. JIM CHAVIS .
MR. JIM CHAVIS . told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR to come to A OLD HOUSE .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went to A OLD HOUSE , and MR. JIM CHAVIS . says , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , '' MR. JIM CHAVIS . says , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 've been watching A LITTLE BOY for a long time , ever since A LITTLE BOY were A LITTLE BOY . ''
And MR. JIM CHAVIS . says , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR want A LITTLE BOY to try to do something .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'm getting old and feeble . ''
But MR. JIM CHAVIS . said there was 22 individuals that recognized in 1934 , WHICH GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND HAVE A RESERVATION , AND BE HIRED BY THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES .
And MR. JIM CHAVIS . says , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR want A LITTLE BOY to take THIS STUFF and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR want A LITTLE BOY to go WASHINGTON DC . ''
Well , at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE .
So MINORITIES agreed to help MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR A LITTLE BIT .
So MINORITIES gave MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR a grant of 1500 dollars .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR took THAT MONEY and used THAT MONEY to buy MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR clothes and stuff and buy MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR gas .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went to WASHINGTON DC and met with THE AMERICAN INDIAN RIGHTS FUND -LSB- NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND -RSB- OUT OF BOULDER , COLORADO .
So -RSB- agreed to give MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM .
A LITTLE BOY ever hear of THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM ?
MALINDA MAYNOR have , THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM 's very well known .
THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM
So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went to WASHINGTON DC and showed some people in THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES that document , where THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM was recognized .
So A GUY FROM TEXAS said , `` Man , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR do n't know what A LITTLE BOY 're talking about . ''
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` BOY , YOU 'LL GET -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- to be here . ''
So BOY , YOU 'LL GET -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- agreed to help MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR find THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT names and the addresses of LUMBEE PEOPLE , of THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM .
What THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM was , THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT come down here and took BLOOD SAMPLES OF THE PEOPLE , and BLOOD SAMPLES OF THE PEOPLE .
And THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT said , well , LUMBEE PEOPLE are one-half OR MORE DEGREE of Indian blood under the Howard-Wheeler Act .
THE INDIAN ORGANIZATION -LSB- Act -RSB- of 1934 , WHICH GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND HAVE A RESERVATION , AND BE HIRED BY THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES .
But what happened , at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , during the 1934 up to up until THE '50S , THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES was trying to terminate Indians .
And THE PEOPLE 'S NAMES AND THE ADDRESSES OF THESE PEOPLE , OF THE 22 got shuffled around through THE RED TAPE and had been forgot about .
So THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM agreed with THE AMERICAN INDIAN RIGHTS FUND -LSB- NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND -RSB- OUT OF BOULDER , COLORADO to come and help US .
And at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , US began to organize and began to march on DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES . , and US sometimes would have 3 and 400 people at the meetings .
And at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , the double voting issue come along .
THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE was where THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWNS could vote for THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY , but THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY could n't vote for THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWNS .
SCHOOL BOARD .
SCHOOL BOARD .
Right .
So WE began to work with WE , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and Deck -LSB- Dexter Brooks -RSB- and MR. DANFORD DIAL-WELL -LSB- Dial -RSB- and HAROLD DEESE and Dr. Dalton Brooks and all of them
-LSB- unclear -RSB- .
In other words , WE began to get a lot of THE INDIAN PEOPLE IN THE HIGH ECHELON into backing WE A LITTLE BIT .
DUPREE CLARK , and so -
Is THE INDIAN ORGANIZATION DUPREE CLARK ?
THE EASTERN CAROLINA INDIAN ORGANIZATION
Okay , so SORT OF THE EARLY ACTIVITIES OF THAT GROUP is SORT OF THE EARLY ACTIVITIES OF THAT GROUP .
MALINDA MAYNOR just want to make sure WE know for THE RED TAPE -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
Go ahead , MALINDA MAYNOR 'm sorry .
And WE had GUS SPEROS , GUS SPEROS was GUS SPEROS .
GUS SPEROS agreed to work along with WE .
GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER was running at THAT TIME AGAINST SKIPPER BOWLES , and during WE activity , that all of the organizing and all of the publicity WE were given , had really got momentum .
THAT TIME AGAINST SKIPPER BOWLES was THAT TIME AGAINST SKIPPER BOWLES .
WE were really moving in a positive direction .
WE had got THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES , SAVE OLD MAIN , DOUBLE VOTING , AND THE WAY THE HIGHWAY PATROL AT THAT TIME WAS TREATING THE INDIAN PEOPLE on the defensive , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR could walk in there and get THE FOOD STAMPS and walk out just like THE FOOD STAMPS .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'd walk in , THEY 'd say , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , who 'd A LITTLE BOY bring out HERE today . ''
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'd say , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 've got THESE 15 PEOPLE THAT ARE GON NA NEED THEIR FOOD STAMPS . ''
And WE could get THE FOOD STAMPS for THESE 15 PEOPLE THAT ARE GON NA NEED THEIR FOOD STAMPS .
The MIGRANT SEASONAL FARMWORKERS ASSOCIATION , A LITTLE BOY ever heard of THESE 15 PEOPLE THAT ARE GON NA NEED THEIR FOOD STAMPS ?
MIGRANT SEASONAL FARMWORKERS ASSOCIATION was A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION , THESE 15 PEOPLE THAT ARE GON NA NEED THEIR FOOD STAMPS 'd give A LITTLE BOY money to buy grocery and kerosene , money to go to THE DOCTOR .
And THESE 15 PEOPLE THAT ARE GON NA NEED THEIR FOOD STAMPS come down here , and THESE 15 PEOPLE THAT ARE GON NA NEED THEIR FOOD STAMPS gave out that evening $ 10,000 in vouchers for PEOPLE to get food , go to THE DOCTOR , medicine , and everything .
And so WE got the Department of Social Services going , WE broke double voting .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR was on the commission to save SAVE OLD MAIN .
WE went out there and was sleeping and snoring .
WE marched , and really got the attention of THE STATE .
So GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER was elected , DENNIS BANKS come down .
During THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , DENNIS BANKS started a movement out in the west , and DENNIS BANKS come all the way down through TEXAS , all the way down through every state DENNIS BANKS 'd come in , DENNIS BANKS 'd pick up so many people .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR was MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR was MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , and at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER was running .
Now , is THIS the Trail of Broken Treaties ?
THIS 's right .
THIS 's being called THE TRAIL OF TEARS , ANDREW JACKSON , WHAT HE DONE .
A LITTLE BOY 're aware about THE TRAIL OF TEARS , ANDREW JACKSON , WHAT HE DONE .
Yeah .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR studied up on ANDREW JACKSON and hated ANDREW JACKSON guts for what ANDREW JACKSON had done .
THE TRAIL OF TEARS , ANDREW JACKSON , WHAT HE DONE was terrible .
THE LONGEST WAR , not the Vietnam War or the Korean War or the War of 18 -LSB- 12 -RSB- , THE LONGEST WAR was THE LONGEST WAR .
THE LONGEST WAR 's THE LONGEST WAR .
THE LONGEST WAR 's still running today .
But anyhow , at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , DENNIS BANKS and all DENNIS BANKS guys that MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mentioned , come down here , and WE went to WASHINGTON DC .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR told him MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR have to come A LONG WAY around .
But anyway , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and DENNIS BANKS and all of us , DENNIS BANKS come down here , and WE camped out up there at THE INDIAN CULTURE CENTER .
WE took THE LAND for four days and FOUR nights , and -
What was THE LAND called back then ? Was THE LAND called THE INDIAN CULTURE CENTER ?
Yeah .
THE RECREATION CENTER .
So WE went in there and barricaded THE RECREATION CENTER . , WE took THE RECREATION CENTER . over , and would n't let nobody come in or go out .
THE SHERIFF 'S Department , would n't let THE SHERIFF 'S Department go in , WE locked the doors .
This wooden door .
So -LSB- MALCOLM -RSB- MCLEOD was MALCOLM -RSB- MCLEOD .
MALCOLM -RSB- MCLEOD says , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , please , get LUMBEE PEOPLE out of HERE .
WE do n't want to hurt nobody , WE do n't want to get this National Guard -LSB- unclear -RSB- . '' -LSB- unclear -RSB- MALCOLM -RSB- MCLEOD was -LSB- unclear -RSB- and everywhere .
At THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE was really , really hot .
MALINDA MAYNOR imagine THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE upset some of THE LUMBEES .
THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE upset SOME OF THE HIGHEST LUMBEES .
How did SOME OF THE HIGHEST LUMBEES react to THAT CAMPING OUT AT THE RECREATION CENTER ?
SOME OF THE HIGHEST LUMBEES did n't particular care , but what THAT CAMPING OUT AT THE RECREATION CENTER had to do , THAT CAMPING OUT AT THE RECREATION CENTER had the momentum going and it was very , very hard to stop .
Because THAT CAMPING OUT AT THE RECREATION CENTER had SO MANY ISSUES THAT CAMPING OUT AT THE RECREATION CENTER wanted to work on .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to work on federal recognition , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to work on THE TREATMENT OF THE INDIANS by THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES , SAVE OLD MAIN , DOUBLE VOTING , AND THE WAY THE HIGHWAY PATROL AT THAT TIME WAS TREATING THE INDIAN PEOPLE .
THAT CAMPING OUT AT THE RECREATION CENTER worked on all of those issues .
So even if THE LUMBEE LEADERSHIP did n't like THE TREATMENT OF THE INDIANS , there was n't a lot THAT CAMPING OUT AT THE RECREATION CENTER would have done about THE LUMBEE LEADERSHIP .
Well , THE SCHOOL BOARD , THAT CAMPING OUT AT THE RECREATION CENTER took over THE SCHOOL BOARD at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , too .
Tell US a little bit about US .
What was behind that particular - .
THE INDIAN SCHOOLS was not up to par to EACH OTHER , to the white schools .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'd go in THE INDIAN SCHOOLS , and sometime MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR just walked through hall and look at the wall and see that THE BATHROOMS , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'd go to a white school and do THE SAME THING , and the difference would be tremendous with the upkeep on the building .
So WE went down there and WE took over the board of education .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and DENNIS BANKS and all WE fellows done that and that brought attention up .
So THE BOARD THAT ARE BLACKS AND INDIANS -
What do YOU mean , took THE BOARD THAT ARE BLACKS AND INDIANS over , YOU just -
Went down there and sat on THE GROUNDS , stayed on THE GROUNDS for THREE or four days .
Got THE NEWS MEDIA INVOLVED , AND THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE .
So we got that pretty well -LSB- unclear -RSB- because THEY did n't want NO BAD PUBLICITY .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , if A LITTLE BOY will correct all these deficiencies , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'll back off .
So THEY began to work on NO BAD PUBLICITY .
THEY did n't like NO BAD PUBLICITY at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE .
So WE went to WASHINGTON DC and THE NEXT MORNING , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'll never forget WASHINGTON DC , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got THE NEWSPAPER A GREAT DEAL and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR looked at WASHINGTON DC , and GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER had won .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` Thank A LITTLE BOY . ''
WE had marched for GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER down here .
WE had marched all over THE FOOD STAMP PLACE .
SKIPPER BOWLES come to RED SPRINGS , ALL OF US , and WE confronted SKIPPER BOWLES in RED SPRINGS , ALL OF US .
SKIPPER BOWLES was SKIPPER BOWLES .
And so ROBESON COUNTY , YOU INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED , THAT WAS IDENTIFYING AS TUSCARORA AT THAT TIME was a very Democratic county , and still is today , but ROBESON COUNTY , YOU INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED , THAT WAS IDENTIFYING AS TUSCARORA AT THAT TIME 's not as bad now as ROBESON COUNTY , YOU INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED , THAT WAS IDENTIFYING AS TUSCARORA AT THAT TIME was back then .
In OTHER WORDS , THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , said , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'll vote for a dog instead of a Republican .
OTHER WORDS 's how bad , stupid THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT was , if MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR must say that word .
But when GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER won , OTHER WORDS made ROBESON COUNTY , YOU INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED , THAT WAS IDENTIFYING AS TUSCARORA AT THAT TIME much easier for us to save SAVE OLD MAIN .
When GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER took over office , GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER said OTHER WORDS would be ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE , is leave ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE where ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE 's at .
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE was ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE .
ME AND JANIE -
Talk about why ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE was such ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE and who YOU worked with -
Well , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR thought that THE FIRST INDIAN NORMAL SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES was THE FIRST INDIAN NORMAL SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES .
THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND HAVE A RESERVATION , AND BE HIRED BY THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES there was THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND HAVE A RESERVATION , AND BE HIRED BY THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES .
THE FIRST , THE FIRST , SAVE OLD MAIN .
And WE did n't want THEM to put THE FIRST over yonder and WE all made -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- .
Like look at what THEM done to the Henry Berry Lowry out there , look at THEM .
Tell THEM SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT .
Well , ME AND JANIE - -LSB- MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR .
All SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT people come together on ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE .
-LSB- unclear -RSB-
Oh , yeah .
Well , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and MR. DANFORD DIAL-WELL and HAROLD DEESE and the Tuscaroras .
Now MR. DANFORD DIAL-WELL , MR. DANFORD DIAL-WELL stood out there and MR. DANFORD DIAL-WELL cried and cried and cried .
MR. DANFORD DIAL-WELL said , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'll die before MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR see IT tore down .
MR. DANFORD DIAL-WELL said , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'll go there and lay down inside of IT .
And all OUR people , A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME just cried and wept over OUR .
So LRDA was behind OUR at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mean , THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE was THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE .
Now , although THE LUMBEE LEADERSHIP really did n't like THE WORD TUSCARORA , but were in a position where OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME really could n't say nothing , because THE LUMBEE LEADERSHIP was helping the welfare of THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT .
So that made A SPRINKLE -
A SPRINKLE sort of pushed YOU out there when A SPRINKLE were unsure too .
Yeah OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME sort of pushed A LITTLE BOY around , but THE LUMBEE LEADERSHIP was still very supportive .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got money from THE LUMBEES to keep THE LUMBEE LEADERSHIP going .
So WE went to WASHINGTON DC and stayed there for three weeks .
Was that THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES ?
THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES , WE took over THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES .
WE had 1500 of WE .
So WE met with-I met with MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and DENNIS BANKS and DENNIS BANKS .
It was FIVE OF US MET WITH NIXON 'S LAWYER .
-LSB- unclear -RSB- what was -LSB- name ? But anyway , -LSB- told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR personally , call MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR over .
Says , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , if A LITTLE BOY 'll get A LITTLE BOY people out of here , go back home , WE 're going to give each organization so much money .
Pay for A LITTLE BOY gas and pay for A LITTLE BOY some food , if A LITTLE BOY 'll get THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT out of here and go back home .
-LSB- says , write MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR A PROPOSAL and send A PROPOSAL direct to MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR .
-LSB- said , WE 'll see that something is done .
Well , in the main process , before WE went there , THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM agreed to file a lawsuit against the Secretary of THE INTERIOR 'S , ROGERS C. B. MORTON , about THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM .
And THE FEDERAL JUDGE AT THAT TIME , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR forgot THE NAME AS LUMBEE INDIANS , THE FEDERAL JUDGE AT THAT TIME said , THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM must honor THE LUMBEE ACT .
The Lumbee Act at that time stated THEY recognized LUMBEE PEOPLE as Indians , but wo n't have NO BENEFITS
-LSB- unclear -RSB- because of THEY status as Indians .
So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR told THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` Let 'S appeal that , Tom . ''
So THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM went to THE FOURTH CIRCUIT Appeals in Richmond .
THE FOURTH CIRCUIT APPEALS argued against THE FOURTH CIRCUIT APPEALS .
So THE FOURTH CIRCUIT APPEALS agreed with us , that THOSE 22 INDIVIDUALS was not under THE LUMBEE ACT .
That LUMBEE INDIANS was more than one half degree of Indian blood .
And THE BORDER LINE PEOPLE was one half or more degree of Indian blood .
And if THE BORDER LINE PEOPLE had any brothers or sisters , THE BORDER LINE PEOPLE were automatically covered .
So what WE done , was THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM and BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL , WE agreed at that time-we had already come back .
WE had done that before , when WE filed A LAWSUIT and lost A LAWSUIT before WE went to WASHINGTON DC .
And then while WE was in WASHINGTON DC , THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM appealed WASHINGTON DC , and THOMAS N. TUREEN AND BARRY NAKELL heard WASHINGTON DC , and THOMAS N. TUREEN AND BARRY NAKELL put 1974 .
When WE come back from WASHINGTON DC , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had A MEETING THAT WEDNESDAY NIGHT , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR told THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` Listen , this is what WE 've got to do . ''
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` WE 've got to write down what WE want . ''
So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had brought a person in to help WE write A GRANT , a proposal for what WE wanted to accomplish .
And there was A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 .
A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 stands up in A MEETING THAT and says , `` Ladies and gentlemen , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 've got some bad news for A LITTLE BOY . ''
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mean , right out of the deep blue sky .
`` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 've got some bad news . ''
A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 paused , A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 said , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR sold us out . ''
A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 said , `` A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 got a hundred thousand dollars .
A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 's got a brand new Cadillac , A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 's got A WOMAN , A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 's married , out of South Carolina .
A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 's got a home at the beach , A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 's got A WOMAN in WASHINGTON DC . ''
And when A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 said that , THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT said -LSB- makes whistling noise -RSB- .
Just sat there .
THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT broke up , THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT left there WEDNESDAY NIGHT .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went home , and about 2:00 that THE NEXT MORNING , THE NEXT MORNING got shot at .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR heard THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT coming to shoot .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR took MY KIDS , and got MY KIDS and put MY KIDS under THE BED .
Then MY WIFE and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got up under THE BED .
And MY WIFE AND ME shot at THE NEXT MORNING that NIGHT .
And to that night right on , MY WIFE AND ME split up in FIVE OF US MET WITH NIXON 'S LAWYER different ways .
Why did MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR say that ?
HIS name was THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR , HIS lived over HERE on the river .
THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR , that -
Chief Howard Brooks .
Not the doctor -
A BYSTANDER , A BYSTANDER 'm saying -
Yeah , THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- .
Yeah , THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR got locked up with GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL .
So HOWARD AFTER-THE took HOWARD AFTER-THE on a streak .
What happened when HOWARD AFTER-THE shot at THE NEXT MORNING , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mama told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR do n't go back there .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` Mom , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'm going back there .
To one more meeting . ''
When MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went back to that meeting that NIGHT , HOWARD AFTER-THE had pitchforks , HOWARD AFTER-THE had knives , HOWARD AFTER-THE had guns , HOWARD AFTER-THE had axes and everything .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mother went with MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , and MY AUNT MAGGIE .
MY AUNT MAGGIE had A .22 PISTOL , and MY AUNT MAGGIE pulled A .22 PISTOL out WEDNESDAY NIGHT , said , `` If A LITTLE BOY all lay A LITTLE BOY hands on him , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'll blow A LITTLE BOY brains out . ''
So we had to back out of A MEETING THAT WEDNESDAY NIGHT .
Where was that meeting ? Was A MEETING THAT at PROSPECT ?
Yeah .
At THE FIRST ?
Uh-huh .
In THE PROCESS , now , this building over HERE ON THE UNION SCHOOL ROAD had got burnt down , somebody arson burned THE PROCESS .
-LSB- unclear -RSB-
And then also , SAVE OLD MAIN got burnt down in THE PROCESS .
All right here at THE SAME TIME ?
All about THE SAME TIME .
THE NEXT MORNING got shot at .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got THREATENED and all .
And since that day , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR never went in another meeting .
HOWARD AFTER-THE takes HOWARD AFTER-THE on A SPREE , and THREATENED goes to RALEIGH and THREATENED gets locked up , A LOT OF THEM gets locked up at PROSPECT .
And then after all A SPREE happened , then HOWARD AFTER-THE wanted MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR to pick A SPREE back up , A LOT OF PEOPLE .
Because what THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR had done , how did A SPREE play out ?
A SPREE just went dead .
THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR got locked up , THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR went to prison .
THEY locked THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR up .
Why did THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR go to prison ?
Marching without a permit , and THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR would n't dismiss , and also THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR would n't go to jail WEDNESDAY NIGHT up there .
And THEY took a warrant out on THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR and locked THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR up anyway .
But MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR never did-after THEY happened , after THEY shot at THE NEXT MORNING , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR never went to another meeting .
And THEY come to MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR house one night , and THEY demanded MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR give THEY all the material MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had .
THEY had THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM , and THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , said , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , if MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR do n't get that material THEY 're going to kill A LITTLE BOY . ''
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had FIVE OF US MET WITH NIXON 'S LAWYER boxes where MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR done research .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mean , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had enough of stuff that MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR really tied down THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . .
But what had happened , when MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR come from THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had no time to copy THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES .
Cause MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR did n't know THIS was coming up .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR give THIS to them WEDNESDAY NIGHT .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 've never been able to get all THIS STUFF back together .
THIS STUFF was scattered HERE and yon .
And after HOWARD AFTER-THE HERE 'd done , then HOWARD AFTER-THE split HOWARD AFTER-THE in FIVE OF US MET WITH NIXON 'S LAWYER different organizations .
A LITTLE BOY had HOWARD AFTER-THE group , A LITTLE BOY had LEON 'S group , THE KEEVER LOCKLEAR GROUP , A LITTLE BOY had VERMON LOCKLEAR-THE HATTERAS TUSCARORA , VERMON LOCKLEAR 'S GROUP .
Then A LITTLE BOY had a group from over HERE at SADDLETREE .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR never did find out who A GUY SITTING IN THERE WHO WAS A GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 22 was .
But LUMBEE PEOPLE were all opportunists .
Then A LITTLE BOY had THE CECIL 'S group , THE CECIL 'S GROUP .
Now , KEEVER got A LITTLE MONEY , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR understand .
LEON 'S still getting money .
Yokes , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR group , VERMON LOCKLEAR-THE HATTERAS TUSCARORA , VERMON LOCKLEAR 'S GROUP , THE CECIL 'S got some money for a short time .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR did manage to-I kind of assisted THE CECIL 'S a little bit along A LONG WAY , because some of THE CECIL 'S were LUMBEE PEOPLE .
And THE CECIL 'S finally got about 5 houses built out of 5 .
And THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR 'S OFFICE agreed to send THE MONEY IN THE HATTERAS TUSCARORA NAME , on that agency , so that automatically put down that THE CECIL 'S did recognize THE CECIL 'S as VERMON LOCKLEAR-THE HATTERAS TUSCARORA , VERMON LOCKLEAR 'S GROUP .
When THE CECIL 'S give THE CECIL 'S THE MONEY IN THE HATTERAS TUSCARORA NAME .
THE CECIL 'S got 5 houses .
But THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR 'S OFFICE finally winded out .
And all of them finally winded out .
Now KEEVER , THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR 'S OFFICE passed away .
And LEON 'S still going A LITTLE BIT , and THE CECIL 'S and THE CECIL 'S just about .
Did any of THE CECIL 'S have to do with - ?
A BYSTANDER , A BYSTANDER was A BYSTANDER .
A LITTLE BIT just picked up-cause MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR was all over in WASHINGTON DC , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR was paid for .
Interviews and from Russia , England , foreign countries .
Switzerland , all over THE FOOD STAMP PLACE .
What made YOU go to WASHINGTON DC to begin with ? And how did YOU involve other Indians in -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ?
Well , what was going on at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , THEY 'S were trying to cut LRDA out .
Who was ?
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT .
THEY 'S cutting THEY 'S back And THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . was THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . we could bring attention to IT THE 24TH ? TAPE 02.24.04-CL -
In THE NEWS MEDIA INVOLVED , AND THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE ?
The main aspect of THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . .
Because MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went out to visit DENNIS BANKS reservation , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mean , BANKS ' RESERVATION was rough .
THEM PEOPLE had BANKS ' RESERVATION rough .
And well , THEM PEOPLE still do .
And THEM PEOPLE 's ONE REASON BECAUSE OF LRDA AT THAT TIME , THEY WERE CUTTING THEIR FUNDS BACK , AND I SAW THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO BRING SOME ATTENTION TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ROBESON COUNTY , THE SCHOOLS , THE RACIAL BARRIERS .
And THEM PEOPLE come down , the Human Rights Commission come down here and had a hearing .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR forgot what year that was in , '73 or ' 74 , somewhere along there .
And WE had testified before the UNITED STATES CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION , WE testified on behalf of UNITED STATES CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION .
And THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT come in HERE and done a lot of reporting , and then JULIAN PIERCE .
Indians began to become aware that they could be elected , because of THE DOUBLE VOTING BEING ABOLISHED .
And JULIAN PIERCE got -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- , and A LITTLE BOY know what happened there .
And then GLENN AND ALL OF THEM began to think about running for sheriff .
And after MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR left that ORGANIZATION , THE GOVERNOR , HOLSHOUSER , offered MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR A JOB .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR could n't not take ORGANIZATION , THE GOVERNOR , HOLSHOUSER .
So GLENN AND ALL OF THEM got A GRANT from the Department of Labor , EDUCATION , and INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES to work A COUPLE YEARS down here , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and Tryon Lowry .
WE had THE GOVERNOR 'S Task Force on Human Progress .
And what WE was , was an organization that paid MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR a salary to do THE SAME THING MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'd done before , but MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR could n't get out there and march and demonstrate .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had to work within THE SYSTEM .
So WE done A GREAT DEAL , done A LOT there .
And so that was STARTING , STARTING , about seventy -
THREE .
THREE .
Because when YOU started working with THE INTERIOR 'S OFFICE -
WE stayed there till ' 76 .
Okay .
So DENNIS BANKS came down to support YOU efforts .
So what WE were trying to do with THE AMERICAN INDIAN MOVEMENT , is that all the Indian people in THE COUNTRY , the living conditions about the same .
Only MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR think the THE LUMBEE and THE WORD TUSCARORA are little bit higher than THE AVERAGE INDIAN .
Right .
On A RESERVATION .
Yeah , reservations .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went out there to DENNIS BANKS place and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went in that sweat lodge .
Boy now , DENNIS ' PLACE 's rough .
DENNIS BANKS put A LITTLE BOY in there naked , and the only way MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR could kind of stay cool , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR dug MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR a hole right between MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR feet and laid down there .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR stuck MY HEAD down in there and stayed kind of cool .
But when MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR left out of there , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR was as red as a chicken .
YOU ca n't get out ?
A BYSTANDER , A LITTLE BOY ca n't get out .
THEY do n't let A LITTLE BOY out , now .
Everybody said MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had to say a prayer in THEY native tongue .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR was the only in there could n't speak Indian , so MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , `` LORD 'S , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wish to GOD A LITTLE BOY 'd let MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR get out of this hole . ''
So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR worked for THE GOVERNOR 'S office there in ' 76 , and at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE A LAWSUIT had been-it was FOUR or FIVE OF US MET WITH NIXON 'S LAWYER houses built out of A LAWSUIT .
THE GOVERNOR 'S OFFICE was MALINDA MAYNOR .
And all the things THE DOUBLE VOTING BEING ABOLISHED had been abolished , we had saved SAVE OLD MAIN , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had worked within THE SYSTEM , and then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got A JOB , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR worked with the CETA program at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE .
What is that ?
THE DOUBLE VOTING BEING ABOLISHED was where THEY had THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT WORK WITH LOW INCOME PEOPLE .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'm run THEY federal programs , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR done that for a couple of A COUPLE YEARS .
Then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR come back and took over general manager of Strike at THE WIND .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR played BOSS STRONG .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR done that from '79 to ' 87 .
And then BOSS STRONG .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR left there and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went back into sales .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR just kind of went away from THE AMERICAN INDIAN MOVEMENT .
Because everybody was so split into THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT WORK WITH LOW INCOME PEOPLE MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR guess .
THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT WORK WITH LOW INCOME PEOPLE 's about THE AMERICAN INDIAN MOVEMENT .
And then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went and , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR told MY WIFE that MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to do something that MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had always wanted to , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went into full time entertaining .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR won A SINGING CONTEST out of Nashville , TN .
And when A LITTLE BOY win A SINGING CONTEST , A LITTLE BOY go in THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT WORK WITH LOW INCOME PEOPLE studio , which is Big Mama Studios in Knoxville , and THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT WORK WITH LOW INCOME PEOPLE let A LITTLE BOY cut A TAPE free , and give A LITTLE BOY 300 to sell .
A LITTLE BOY could start A LITTLE BOY
-LSB- unclear -RSB- .
So A SINGING CONTEST 's what MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR done .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR cut A TAPE , and then after MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR cut that tape , the producer wanted MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR to cut another one , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR cut another one .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had TWO songs on the charts over in Europe .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR made A LITTLE MONEY , then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR sold MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR tapes , and in THE PROCESS MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had A SON TO GET KILLED .
And when A SON TO GET KILLED got killed then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went into retirement .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR tried that for '97 up until December of 2003 .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR said , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'm tired of '97 , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'm going back to work .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR QUITE A STORY .
QUITE A STORY 's QUITE A STORY .
-LSB- unclear -RSB- .
Is that pretty well what A LITTLE BOY were wanting ?
Yeah .
MALINDA MAYNOR 'm curious about when YOU THE FIRST started doing research into our THE WORD TUSCARORA heritage , and understanding THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM and that whole history , was there a group of people in ROBESON COUNTY , YOU INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED , THAT WAS IDENTIFYING AS TUSCARORA AT THAT TIME ?
Before MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR come in ? Uh-uh -LSB- A BYSTANDER -RSB- .
Yeah , or that were-was there A LONG HOUSE , was there -
There was A LONG HOUSE , back in THE '30S , OKAY .
In THE '30S , OKAY .
THE '30S , OKAY and '40s and '50s .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mean , the old house where THEY were recognized , where THEY took the blood test , is still standing .
Oh yeah ? Where is that ?
Over THERE ON -LSB- HWY -RSB- 74 .
THERE ON -LSB- HWY -RSB- 74 curve there .
Do A LITTLE BOY know where MR. ARCHIE lives ? MR. ARCHIE that runs THE BEST FUEL , got all MR. ARCHIE equipment out there , that old house right there in front of that curve .
What MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to do , but MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR never did get around to THE BEST FUEL , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to THE BEST FUEL , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to put a monument there .
Because THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM , 22 was 22 .
THE ONLY TIME-THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY TIME .
Why do YOU think THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . did THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . 22 ?
Prolonged federal recognition .
THE ONLY TIME-THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY TIME . were trying to prove THE ONLY TIME-THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY TIME . were n't Indians here , THE ONLY TIME-THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY TIME . 's what THE ONLY TIME-THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY TIME . was trying to prove .
Illegally , THE ONLY TIME-THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY TIME . wanted to have some way of doing THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . so THE ONLY TIME-THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY TIME . came up with that blood .
Yeah .
THE ONLY TIME-THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY TIME . had done all kinds of THE STUDIES ALL ALONG here .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR give A LITTLE BOY A FOOLISH WAY OF DOING THAT .
A FOOLISH WAY OF DOING THAT was A FOOLISH WAY OF DOING THAT .
A LITTLE BOY could look at THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT pictures , some of THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT that look Indian did n't pass for Indian .
And SOME THAT DID N'T LOOK INDIAN would pass .
Something that PEOPLE ask MALINDA MAYNOR often as MALINDA MAYNOR 'm doing SOME RESEARCH , PEOPLE say , now how do YOU give any credit to a process or a group of tests that were so silly , and how do YOU deal with that question , in terms , if THIS SORT OF WEIRD TEST is THIS SORT OF WEIRD TEST , how do YOU reconcile THE FACT that THE FACT appeared so useless ?
THE METHOD , but the point is , that PEOPLE recognized us .
THE METHOD was THE METHOD that PEOPLE used , and PEOPLE was good enough for PEOPLE .
Because there was so much pressure put on PEOPLE , THE HAMMONDS ' , and THE HAMMONDS ' and the Revels ' and THE BROOKS ' and the Locklears ' , PEOPLE were organizing back in THOSE DAYS , too .
And THE SAME THING happened back then , happened to MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR .
PEOPLE split off .
And THE SAME THING died down .
How did THE SAME THING split off back then ?
JEALOUSY AMONG THE PEOPLE .
Which we have JEALOUSY AMONG THE PEOPLE . today .
And at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , Mr. MR. FULLER 'S -LSB- Lowry -RSB- come along , A LITTLE BOY see .
In THE '50S , started about '50 when the Ku Klux Klan come up there in MAXTON .
What MAXTON done , MAXTON would call in LUMBEE INDIANS from PROSPECT , Upaheads , and then LUMBEE INDIANS across the street , LUMBEE INDIANS .
LUMBEE INDIANS was MR. FULLER 'S term .
Yeah .
And at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE MR. FULLER 'S was MR. FULLER 'S .
And MR. FULLER 'S got , it was 12-they put that THE LUMBEE name in a vote , so that PEOPLE actually voted in THIS 12,000 for and 3,000 against THIS 12,000 .
At THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 've forgot how many Indians lived in ROBESON COUNTY , YOU INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED , THAT WAS IDENTIFYING AS TUSCARORA AT THAT TIME .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR do n't even know .
But during THE STUDIES ALL ALONG , McPherson and all those people said that LUMBEE PEOPLE are more than one-half or more Indian blood , LUMBEE PEOPLE are Indians .
But back when MR. FULLER 'S -LSB- unclear -RSB- - A LITTLE BOY see , what happened , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR talked to SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS VERY ACTIVE BACK THEN , and SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS VERY ACTIVE BACK THEN said that MR. CARLYLE put that phrase in there when MR. CARLYLE got to WASHINGTON DC that `` There shall be no benefits for Indians because of SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS VERY ACTIVE BACK THEN status as Indians . ''
A LITTLE BOY will get NO BENEFITS .
NO BENEFITS was added in there when MR. FULLER 'S got to WASHINGTON DC .
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS VERY ACTIVE BACK THEN said , MR. THOMAS OVER HERE at SADDLETREE , told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR SADDLETREE was not in THE LUMBEE BILL AT THAT TIME when MR. THOMAS OVER HERE left here .
MR. CARLYLE was the one that introduced SADDLETREE in the House of Representatives .
And PRESIDENT FORD was one from Michigan asked PRESIDENT FORD on the floor of the Senate , House of Representatives .
PRESIDENT FORD said , `` MR. CARLYLE , in OTHER WORDS WHAT YOU 'RE SAYING , WE will not be obliged to give LUMBEE PEOPLE one penny of money . ''
PRESIDENT FORD said , `` OTHER WORDS WHAT YOU 'RE SAYING 's right . ''
MR. CARLYLE is THE ONE SUCKED US IN -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- .
And GUS SPEROS was GUS SPEROS ?
Yeah .
MALINDA MAYNOR wonder why GUS SPEROS did THE ONE SUCKED US IN -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- .
Well , THEY hated Indians , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mean , back in THOSE DAYS , LUMBERTON was - .
THEY just did n't matter .
It was the political influence that -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
Well , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR remember when MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went to RED SPRINGS , ALL OF US , and A WOMAN told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , when MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR was MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR .
Said now , we can give A LITTLE BOY an ice cream , son , but A LITTLE BOY 've got to eat RED SPRINGS , ALL OF US outside .
A LITTLE BOY ca n't be here .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR remember that , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR remember that fluently .
WILLIE LOWERY do too .
THE DRUGSTORE OVER THERE , YOU could n't -
Over on Main Street there .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR go by there and look at THE DRUGSTORE OVER THERE and get aggravated .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR had a movie theater too .
Yeah .
A LITTLE BOY could n't sit with them .
A LITTLE BOY had to go upstairs in LUMBERTON .
And MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR remember MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and A BOY , went down to Fairmont .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'd go stay with A BOY , same way down there .
A LITTLE BOY could n't go .
A LITTLE BOY could n't eat nothing .
A LITTLE BOY could n't do nothing .
So it was SORT OF THE WHITE POLITICAL POWER STRUCTURE IN LUMBERTON THAT WAS KEEPING MOST OF THE INDIAN OPPORTUNITY DOWN ?
Yes , definitely .
-LSB- unclear -RSB- And SORT OF THE WHITE POLITICAL POWER STRUCTURE IN LUMBERTON THAT WAS KEEPING MOST OF THE INDIAN OPPORTUNITY DOWN was during OUR tenure there , OUR was ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DONE , OUR just did n't have equal opportunity .
OUR people had to go to-they could n't go to school here in the State of North Carolina , in CHAPEL HILL .
OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME had to go out of state .
-LSB- unclear -RSB- to go out of THE STATE .
Oh yeah , OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME had to go out of state .
MOST OF THEM THAT GOT THEIR DEGREES AT THAT TIME had to leave here to go get MOST OF THEM THAT GOT THEIR DEGREES AT THAT TIME .
Do YOU want to talk A LITTLE BIT more about GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL and THE HOWARD BROOKS THAT WAS -LSB- UNCLEAR association with one another ? Because one of the things MALINDA MAYNOR have n't heard too much about so far is the connections between Indians and THE BLACKS .
MALINDA MAYNOR know SOME PEOPLE say , well , SOME PEOPLE 're TWO separate movements , and other people say , well , SOME PEOPLE 're working together .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR did n't work too much - MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR believe ONE REASON BECAUSE OF LRDA AT THAT TIME , THEY WERE CUTTING THEIR FUNDS BACK , AND I SAW THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO BRING SOME ATTENTION TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ROBESON COUNTY , THE SCHOOLS , THE RACIAL BARRIERS , GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL - HOWARD AFTER-THE had EDUCATION .
And GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL had been in the civil rights movement for quite a while .
GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL knew some ropes to pull , and that TYPE THING .
And GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL wanted to build GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL reputation again .
So GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL was the brains behind TYPE THING .
But MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR did n't know , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR did n't get all that involved with GOLDEN FRINKS , WELL .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR did get involved with Dr. Joy Johnson , who was in the House at THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE .
And WE worked on SO MANY ISSUES here , and then what had BEN FRANKLIN come down , who was with the-what organization ? BEN FRANKLIN was from WILMINGTON , BEN FRANKLIN was with the Wilmington 10 .
WE worked on THE ISSUES-CAUSE ANYTHING THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE BLACK WOULD BENEFIT THE INDIAN , cause WE was about in the same boat .
And WE learned that from there , to go to voting together .
And THE ISSUES-CAUSE ANYTHING THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE BLACK WOULD BENEFIT THE INDIAN happened today , THE ISSUES-CAUSE ANYTHING THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE BLACK WOULD BENEFIT THE INDIAN INDIAN PEOPLE and blacks vote primarily together .
But MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR think now THE WHITES have begun to see that THE INDIAN PEOPLE IN THE HIGH ECHELON control the political arena and now , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR think THE WHITES and Indians is working more closely together than THE BLACKS .
THE BLACKS are kind of mad , A LITTLE BOY know .
THE BLACKS 've got nobody like the clerk of the court , or the register of deeds or THE SHERIFF 'S department .
THE BLACKS 've had TWO or THREE run , A LITTLE BOY know , but THE BLACKS 've had nobody to really combat MALINDA MAYNOR and Jo Ann -LSB- Locklear -RSB- and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR -RSB- .
Now A LITTLE BOY know , A LITTLE BOY 've got SEVERAL on THE BOARD THAT ARE BLACKS AND INDIANS , and of course that board of education has been a mockery .
SEVERAL ca n't stand to get together and pull together for the benefit of THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ACTIVE WITH YOU ON THAT .
Everybody wants SEVERAL little old pie , and everybody wants to be MY HEAD .
THEIR LITTLE OLD PIE 's like this last move SEVERAL made down there , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR do n't get involved in THEIR LITTLE OLD PIE all that much , but SEVERAL brought A GUY FROM TEXAS in from Canada , who 's the superintendent , but MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR think A GUY FROM TEXAS 's just A GUY FROM TEXAS , and wo n't do all that much .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR talked with A LOT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS , THE BOARD MEMBERS 're not satisfied with A GUY FROM TEXAS .
So A LITTLE BOY 're stuck with A LOT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS .
And we had qualified people .
In other words , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR think A LITTLE BOY take CARE OF YOUR HOME FOLKS THE FIRST and then move out .
A LITTLE BOY know what MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'm saying ? So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR did n't have all that much to do with HOWARD AFTER-THE movement after MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR left .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR believe in unity , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR believe in pulling one force .
Because if A LITTLE BOY 've got that one over yonder fighting and that one over yonder fighting , in the end A LITTLE BOY wo n't accomplish nothing .
All those movements did n't accomplish another thing after MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR left .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR could n't see a thing THEY 'd done .
Nothing .
THEY wrote grants and that TYPE THING , got A LITTLE MONEY .
But as far as making any dramatic change , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR did n't see TYPE THING .
What did YOU think about the incidents of taking over the cultural center in the '80s , when THE CECIL 'S went in there to sit in , and a bunch of them got arrested ?
A LITTLE BOY know , at that time THE CECIL 'S had TWO different groups .
Some wanted to have THE GOLF COURSE , and some did n't .
And -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
As a result of the split off , YOU said SOME went 22 and SOME went 22 ?
Yeah , uh-huh .
And then THE CECIL 'S , MISS MARY , SOME was a golfer , MISS MARY .
But MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR think THE STATE pretty well got that straightened out when THE CECIL 'S took THE GOLF COURSE and put THE GOLF COURSE in a separate entity by THE GOLF COURSE over there .
But MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR understand NOW there ai n't nobody working up there for THE INDIAN CULTURE CENTER .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR do n't think THE CECIL 'S 've got anybody hired .
At ONE TIME , WE formed a-primarily myself-formed a local group of people to be an advocate for the North Carolina Indian Cultural Center .
WE 'd go out there and WE 'd clean ONE TIME up every Saturday , work all day every Saturday cutting the grass and cleaning THE BATHROOMS .
And ONE TIME had went down , and WE went out there and WE fixed the pool , WE fixed THE BATHROOMS , WE painted THE BATHROOMS , WE cut all the grass and cut all the trees down .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR and HAROLD COLLINS and BREWINGTON over HERE and Mark and MY WIFE .
There was about 200 of WE , would go out there every Saturday and clean up and do .
So WE got that in pretty good shape .
WE 'd clean up Strike at THE WIND , BUDDY AND JOHN and all of us , Evans Fire Department .
And then BUDDY AND JOHN got WE wanting to fight there , and so MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR kind of backed out of WE .
-LSB- Laughter . -RSB-
Well , BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL said THE WIND to MALINDA MAYNOR , MALINDA MAYNOR asked BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL , why BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL thought THE TUSCARORA GROUPS split off , and BARRY NAKELL FROM CHAPEL HILL said , `` Well , it seems to MALINDA MAYNOR that when ONE GROUP gets a little bit of power , THE TUSCARORA GROUPS do n't want to share ONE GROUP . ''
And THE WIND was THE WIND .
THE WIND 's right .
THE TUSCARORA GROUPS get so jealous of each other .
But MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR think what WE done during WE , '69 up until ' 86 , really molded everything together .
Really put everybody in WASHINGTON DC and RALEIGH said `` hey , A LITTLE BOY better watch WASHINGTON DC , THE TUSCARORA GROUPS 're marching over yonder .
A LITTLE BOY better watch WASHINGTON DC . ''
So MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR went to WASHINGTON DC last year and THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM up there , BREWINGTON girl , BREWINGTON GIRL works with the THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT , THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM .
BREWINGTON GIRL told MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , said , `` MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR want to tell A LITTLE BOY something . ''
BREWINGTON GIRL says , `` A LITTLE BOY know what , THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM says , what A LITTLE BOY all have done , back in THE '70S and early '80s , THE '70S , is the reason THOSE ORGANIZATIONS IN ROBESON COUNTY get money . ''
BREWINGTON GIRL said THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM , THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM said every time LRDA gets A GRANT , Tribal Council gets A GRANT , the comptroller has to write off on THOSE ORGANIZATIONS IN ROBESON COUNTY .
And THOMAS N. TUREEN WITH THEM always goes back and has a excuse to give money , because of THE 22 , THE WAY THEY RECOGNIZED THEM , was recognized by THE BIA , INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES .
So baby that 's as far as MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR can do .
YOU did better than most .
YOU did A JOB -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
Very good .
Yep .
Well , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR still say there 's a lot YOU could do .
THE MOST -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 're THE MOST -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- PEOPLE IN THE WORLD .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR mean , GOD has really blessed LUMBEE PEOPLE .
WILLIE LOWERY just hope the young people do n't let all that 's been done in the past to move LUMBEE PEOPLE along fall on the wayside .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR do too .
Cause MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR do n't have THE SAME DRIVE WE DID .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got everything will be alright , MAMA AND DADDY 'S took CARE OF YOUR HOME FOLKS .
Yeah , somebody 'S got to pick 'S up and REALLY go with REALLY .
MAMA AND DADDY 'S 've got to find an issue .
And what MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to do , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to get A MARKER FOR THE 22 .
But MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to get-with the good LORD 'S help , and some people here in locally , MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR got A NAME MARKER FOR MR. JIM CHAVIS , A NAME MARKER FOR MR. JIM CHAVIS .
Have A LITTLE BOY seen that ?
Yes .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR raised 1200 dollars and had that done .
MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to get A MARKER FOR THE 22 on -LSB- HWY -RSB- 74 , and MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to have a streak of Highway 74 named in honor of Dr. MR. ADOLPH -LSB- Dial -RSB- .
Now whether we like -LSB- HWY -RSB- 74 or not , -LSB- HWY -RSB- 74 accomplished A GREAT DEAL in -LSB- HWY -RSB- 74 life , and -LSB- HWY -RSB- 74 done A LOT .
A lot of help .
Who 's that ?
MR. ADOLPH
Then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to get something in the park , and HAROLD COLLINS approached MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
And then MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR wanted to go in THE RACIAL BARRIERS and have talent shows , get THE BEST TALENT I COULD FIND , put THE BEST TALENT I COULD FIND on video , and go before THESE BIG COMPANIES LIKE PEPSI , JUICY FRUIT , POTATO CHIPS , and have OUR PEOPLE AT THAT TIME on commercial television .
Equal justice is what MR. CARNELL LOCKLEAR 'm talking about .
Well , right .
When YOU think about , especially in this area , regional television , the number of Indians here , and YOU never see THESE BIG COMPANIES LIKE PEPSI , JUICY FRUIT , POTATO CHIPS on TV unless something bad happens .
Yeah , YOU 's right .
Unless somebody gets shot .
Yeah .
Somebody gets shot or somebody gets arrested for dope .
A LITTLE BOY see THEM good , before that A LITTLE BOY do n't see THEM .
It 's amazing .
NOW , where do A LITTLE BOY get A LITTLE BOY money from ?
Well , UNC -
