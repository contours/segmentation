In the city of BIRMINGHAM because WE 'll get anyone who wants to transfer from BIRMINGHAM into THESE SCHOOLS , if THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES have residency here .
So THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES , THIS LAND was like a dumpsite , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think , YEARS ago .
Under , all this was underdeveloped and A LOT OF IT was owned by , from what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION understand , THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY .
THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY gave , sold WE this property fairly cheap , from what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION understand , because THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES wanted -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL to be in THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY .
So when THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES go out and campaign for industry , THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES can say there 's a private school in THIS , within the city limits of BIRMINGHAM .
So - -LSB- tape turned off and on again -RSB-
Good morning .
THIS is KIMBERLY HILL .
KIMBERLY HILL 'm at John Carroll High School with A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , and WE are talking about school desegregation and the civil rights movement after the 1960s .
Thank YOU for meeting with KIMBERLY HILL this morning .
A GOOD CATHOLIC 're welcome .
WE 're going to start by talking about YOU growing up YEARS and how YOU became A TEACHER 'S and how YOU came to BIRMINGHAM .
Well , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION grew up in KENTUCKY , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think being in Kentucky A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was THE WAY , THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE more moderate regarding INTEGRATION AND DESEGREGATION than A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would 've been if A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had been born down here .
THE OTHER THING , MANY OF THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION grew up in A CATHOLIC SCHOOL , going to A CATHOLIC SCHOOL , GRADE SCHOOL and high school , and many of the sisters that were , that taught A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION were from Massachusetts even though THE OTHER THING , MANY OF THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS was THE OTHER THING , MANY OF THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS .
So A CATHOLIC would have had DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT THEY WOULD MAYBE COME ACROSS IN THE CLASSROOM .
A CATHOLIC did n't deliberately preach that segregation was wrong or anything , but A CATHOLIC were very careful to give US a positive view of A CATHOLIC .
THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO always had AMERICAN PEOPLE in THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO .
Now sometimes AMERICAN PEOPLE did n't go to US schools because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION got THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE , and sometimes AMERICAN PEOPLE had a difficulty with transportation , and at THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER was really also against the law .
Probably against the law of the churches too but US never knew about THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE and accepted THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE .
AMERICAN PEOPLE always had a couple of THEIR PEWS in THE BACK SAID SOMETHING LIKE COLORED ONLY , and the priest would regularly have to tell the white people to stop sitting there because in all A CATHOLIC churches the last TWO or THREE pews were the most favorite ones .
AMERICAN PEOPLE would have to sit outside THEIR PEWS .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION guess A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was always aware of those kinds of THINGS .
So THE BACK SAID SOMETHING LIKE COLORED ONLY was n't that big of a deal to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
THE BACK SAID SOMETHING LIKE COLORED ONLY 's sort of odd .
HIS FATHER 'S seemed by today 's standards to be very bigoted but HIS FATHER 'S TWO best friends were , one was A KID that HIS FATHER 'S grew up with and would come back and see HIS FATHER 'S regularly , and the thing A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION most remember about HIS FATHER 'S is big , black man .
DADDY 'S was about FIVE-SIX , ONLY FIVE , not much bigger than ONLY FIVE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , and this man FIVE-SIX seemed to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION like six-two or six-three and really big like DADDY 'S could be DADDY 'S tackle in A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION eyes .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd hear DADDY 'S say there 's OLD THEOTO , and DADDY 'S would come and visit with DADDY 'S any time DADDY 'S came back to KENTUCKY .
So WE could see the affection between them , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION also began to realize when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION that DADDY 'S would make all these racist statements to get a rise out of WE as THEIR KIDS .
Like one time DADDY 'S said , `` Yeah , OLD THEOTO thinks DADDY 'S 's as good as any white person . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION older sister said , `` Well , is n't DADDY 'S ? '' DADDY 'S talked for a few minutes and DADDY 'S said , `` Actually DADDY 'S 's better than MOST WHITE PEOPLE . ''
But WE began realizing DADDY 'S was saying all these statements that were just to make WE upset because DADDY 'S was a big tease in THAT WAY .
But so , DADDY 'S really did n't like integration .
To A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION it was sort of funny in some ways because in KENTUCKY WE lived on THE OHIO RIVER , and THE OHIO RIVER was totally integrated .
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION standing on THE BANK FISHING and off THE DAM , THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION would stand off THE DAM .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't remember how THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION worked , but THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION could fish there .
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION were totally integrated , and then THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION would separate and go THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION own ways .
But when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION came down here , THE BANK FISHING was THE BANK FISHING .
But at -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL again A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know why , but most of THE FACULTY was not that prejudiced .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm sure SOME OF THEM were but even before integration , and so SOME OF THEM were , A GOOD CATHOLIC would never hear someone use a racial slur or anything like THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION .
SOME OF US were just absolutely very much on MAYBE EVEN THE , US would consider the raving liberal side of what SOME OF US would consider US .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION mentioned earlier that one of my friends came back to school A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER SHE HAD LEFT , AND ONE OF THE TEACHERS IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE THE INTEGRATION .
A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER SHE HAD LEFT , AND ONE OF THE TEACHERS IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE THE INTEGRATION was amazed in THE FACULTY ROOM how US were making fun of GEORGE WALLACE and all GEORGE WALLACE campaign , throwing the gauntlet down .
US would exaggerate GEORGE WALLACE `` Segregation Now .
HIS `` SEGREGATION NOW . ''
US would all those phrases that FOREVER would just say US were making THEIR OWN FAULT and laughing about , and A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER SHE HAD LEFT , AND ONE OF THE TEACHERS IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE THE INTEGRATION told US later A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER SHE HAD LEFT , AND ONE OF THE TEACHERS IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE THE INTEGRATION said , `` A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was glad to come to -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL because A GOOD CATHOLIC , A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't realize THEIR OWN FAULT , but A GOOD CATHOLIC all are raving IDIOTS , NOT IDIOTS , but raving liberals .
A GOOD CATHOLIC just do n't know how liberal A GOOD CATHOLIC all are . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , `` Really .
A GOOD CATHOLIC mean THE OTHER SCHOOLS do n't do THE OTHER SCHOOLS . ''
She said , `` No .
They 're just all against IT and all IT . ''
But -
Do YOU think PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU WERE IDIOTS TOO ?
Probably .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't think PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU WERE IDIOTS TOO really did .
NO ONE cared about us except the Catholics probably were , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't hear too many sermons about NO ONE but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did hear A COUPLE in THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO that A COUPLE sort of edged on THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO not treating other people -LSB- right -RSB- .
Everybody knew who A COUPLE was talking about , not treating OTHER PEOPLE like OTHER PEOPLE should and so on .
MANY OF THE PRIESTS down here were Irish .
MANY OF THE PRIESTS were n't getting enough native vocations and about half of the diocese , diocese and THE PRIESTS were Irish .
So MANY OF THE PRIESTS had a whole different aspect and mind frame than perhaps some of THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION did .
Well , when integration was coming , THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS INTEGRATED WE had already met WE maximum population .
For some reason , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION ca n't remember exactly why , but A THOUSAND was A THOUSAND that THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD could hold , and if A GOOD CATHOLIC had 1001 , the accrediting societies would make A GOOD CATHOLIC add more restrooms and more water fountains and more this and more that .
So WE were right at 998 , and THE NEXT YEAR , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS had a really difficult time integrating at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS .
THEIR KIDS were walking out and striking and all this foolishness going on .
THE NEXT YEAR WE did integrate with four students , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm sure THEIR KIDS were chosen to be success - .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THEIR KIDS interviewed THEIR KIDS and sort of prepared THEIR KIDS and made sure THEIR KIDS were THE KIND OF STUDENT THAT WOULD BE A SUCCESS AT CARROLL TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS N'T ANY REASON FOR ANY OF THE WHITE KIDS TO COMPLAIN or THEIR KIDS parents to complain .
There were TWO boys and TWO girls .
Was that in terms of academic success ?
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think probably academic and refined and social and whatever .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not sure of the categories .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do remember , sort of remember someone saying THEY told THEY that THEY could go to any function , of course as a student , but THEY asked if THEY went to a dance not to try to dance with THE WHITE KIDS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know whether THEY went or not because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION went out of A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION way to keep from positions of having to be responsible for DANCES and so on like this .
STUDENT COUNCIL was always -LSB- unclear -RSB- , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION sort of made sure A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was never A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION hated THE KIND OF STUDENT THAT WOULD BE A SUCCESS AT CARROLL TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS N'T ANY REASON FOR ANY OF THE WHITE KIDS TO COMPLAIN to school things .
A GOOD CATHOLIC 'd be responsible for THE WHITE KIDS conduct , and at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS A GOOD CATHOLIC had to watch , make sure TWO GIRLS were modestly dressed , and THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER always had a bunch of `` lay , '' what do A GOOD CATHOLIC call THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS , the thin material , not file but netting .
THE WHITE KIDS would drape MAYBE EVEN THE , if THE WHITE KIDS -
Really .
Yeah .
THE WHITE KIDS 'd put MAYBE EVEN THE over THE WHITE KIDS shoulders .
Yeah .
A GOOD CATHOLIC know .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't want to be any part of THE WHITE KIDS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've got enough to do preparing MY LESSONS and as A NEW TEACHER , but anyway , like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION say , whether THE WHITE KIDS went or not .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not quite sure .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did have one of the students in MY CLASS , A GIRL , by the name of MADELYN HUMPHREY , and A VERY GOOD STUDENT was A VERY GOOD STUDENT .
There was NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST HER , and THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN were , there was n't any problem with THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN seating or anything .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION -LSB- taught -RSB- just like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do even today .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION set A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION kids alphabetically so A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could learn THEIR NAMES .
So there was n't any problem with THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN .
-LSB- ONE -RSB- THAT BROUGHT SYMPATHY TO THE REST OF THE KIDS was -LSB- ONE -RSB- THAT BROUGHT SYMPATHY TO THE REST OF THE KIDS .
THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN were talking about SOME MOVIE THAT WAS REAL POPULAR , AND YEAH , it 'll be SIX MONTHS FOR YOU before SOME MOVIE THAT WAS REAL POPULAR , AND YEAH gets into the theatres in THE SOUTH .
THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN always send SOME MOVIE THAT WAS REAL POPULAR , AND YEAH to us .
HER said if A GOOD CATHOLIC think THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN 's bad HER said A GOOD CATHOLIC ought to see how SOME MOVIE THAT WAS REAL POPULAR , AND YEAH is with THE BLACK THEATRES .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS there was a colored theatre or whatever .
HER used or THE BLACK THEATRES , if SIX MONTHS FOR YOU 's SIX MONTHS FOR YOU , SIX MONTHS FOR YOU 's going to be a year for ME AND THE KIDS , ME AND THE KIDS sort of - .
SIX MONTHS FOR YOU silenced ME AND THE KIDS , and SIX MONTHS FOR YOU sort of , ME AND THE KIDS is bad .
But then HER was A JUNIOR , and THE BOTH BOY , THE BOTH BOY , was A JUNIOR .
A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY was A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY , and A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY got ...
At THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS THE STUDENT COUNCIL THAT GIVES THE REAL LEADERSHIP had representatives in EACH HOMEROOM , and EACH HOMEROOM elected the representative .
A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY was elected from the very FIRST as A HOMEROOM representative .
So WE were quite happy to see A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY was so outgoing and friendly , and THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN thought enough of A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY to do WE .
Obviously there only was ONE other student in the school in MY CLASS , A GIRL that could vote , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not sure ONE OTHER STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL IN HER CLASS THAT COULD VOTE was even in A HOMEROOM .
So then after ONE , the next year one of the traditionally black high schools closed , and ONE was ONE .
THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN were probably just hanging on .
So WE got , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how many students .
At THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was n't teaching MANY SENIORS OR JUNIORS , but WE got FOUR ? or ONLY FIVE or SIX OF THEM or SEVEN or something like MANY SENIORS OR JUNIORS .
WE still have one school that is not a diocesan school .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know if WE means A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA to A GOOD CATHOLIC .
A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA is under the control of A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON .
A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA 's A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA .
THIS ENSLEY is now actually part of BIRMINGHAM .
So -LSB- THIS ENSLEY was THIS ENSLEY originally because THIS ENSLEY 's where THE STEEL MILLS were .
A CATHOLIC employed about TWELVE or thirteen thousand .
There was a whole complex there at a time when THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS could not go into a white hospital to practice surgery .
So THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS did n't , so when THEIR PATIENTS needed surgery , THEIR PATIENTS had to turn THEIR PATIENTS over to a white doctor .
So THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS started in THE 1940S .
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS established HOLY FAMILY HOSPITAL , HOLY FAMILY HOSPITAL , and THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS did have surgery there .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how complicated surgery was in THE 1940S .
And THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS had A HIGH SCHOOL AND A GRADE SCHOOL .
When A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER were THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER .
WE could collect money for clothes for THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION remember coming home and telling DADDY 'S , `` SOME OF THESE KIDS have to walk to school barefoot without any shoes .
WE 're going to collect money to buy THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER SHOES , '' and DADDY 'S laughed .
DADDY 'S said , `` SOME OF THESE KIDS 's not cold enough in ENSLEY , ALABAMA to ever wear SHOES .
THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER 're not going to walk in the snow . ''
When A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION got down here , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought of THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER , and it really is cold enough to wear SHOES here .
But when -LSB- unclear -RSB- A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think gee , is THIS ENSLEY , -LSB- ONE -RSB- THAT BROUGHT SYMPATHY TO THE REST OF THE KIDS , and sure enough A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION met SOME OF THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER .
So SOME OF THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER were in such need that YOU even heard about THIS ENSLEY in KENTUCKY .
Yeah , THE SAME RELIGIOUS ORDER THAT STAFFED THE GRADE SCHOOL was THE SAME RELIGIOUS ORDER THAT STAFFED THE GRADE SCHOOL .
So SOME OF THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER were taking CARE OF THEIR OWN MISSION , and SO LITTLE HOLY NAME IN GRADE SCHOOL IN HENDERSON , KENTUCKY was trying to help A VERY DANGEROUS THING FOR ANYONE , ANY SCHOOL TO DO I THINK TO DO THAT here in ENSLEY , ALABAMA .
And then SOME OF THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER had A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL UNDER THE SAME ORDER THE SALESIAN FATHERS , a different order of THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER staffed A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL UNDER THE SAME ORDER THE SALESIAN FATHERS .
THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER called A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL UNDER THE SAME ORDER THE SALESIAN FATHERS .
Holy Name -
KIMBERLY HILL do n't think THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER reached anybody there .
A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL UNDER THE SAME ORDER THE SALESIAN FATHERS might be closed down .
A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL UNDER THE SAME ORDER THE SALESIAN FATHERS probably only has about 125 , something like 125 .
THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER , even though A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL UNDER THE SAME ORDER THE SALESIAN FATHERS 's sort of odd .
Even though A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL UNDER THE SAME ORDER THE SALESIAN FATHERS 's A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL UNDER THE SAME ORDER THE SALESIAN FATHERS , A CATHOLIC do n't have MANY CATHOLICS there .
Someone said maybe ONLY FIVE or SIX OF THEM , and some of A CATHOLIC say MAYBE AS MANY AS TWENTY .
We get most of THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS that are AN AFRICAN AMERICAN .
But THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS are , THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS 're having A REAL DIFFICULTY surviving .
THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS 're talking about making A REAL DIFFICULTY some kind of school that THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS pair up - .
THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS started in THE NORTH THAT ARE CATHOLIC , and THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS 're tied to an industry or A BUSINESS , and THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN work in A BUSINESS , and A BUSINESS 's supposed to be really good academics , and THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN have to take academic subjects , not A TRADE SCHOOL KIND OF A THING .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION hope that NORTH does succeed .
THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS 're investigating NORTH to see if there is support among THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS and the business to do so .
A FEW YEARS ago A FEW YEARS was maybe just TWO , LAST YEAR 'S , WHO WAS IT it was about ready to close , and THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN went out and campaigned and got SOME MONEY .
A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON does support A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON .
From WHAT A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION understand WHAT give A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON a couple hundred thousand dollars to help WHAT , but A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON is not really A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON .
But so A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION hope A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON does succeed because there is a need in that section for A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON .
SOME OF THE GRADUATES were really upset at THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE that that school would close .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't , and SOME OF THE GRADUATES 's so small .
THE GRADUATES would n't have to be open during THE SUMMER I BELIEVE .
Let THE GRADUATES clarify QUITE A BIT because as THE GRADUATES were talking out in the hall there is AT LEAST ONE BLACK STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED FROM HERE IN ' 65 .
There were TWO .
The FIRST TWO , THE BOTH BOY and A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY , MADELYN HUMPHREY and Robert Smith .
There were more than two THE NEXT YEAR because in the meantime Immaculata closed , and we got some of AT LEAST ONE BLACK STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED FROM HERE IN ' 65 .
At least one of them was that Bell - William Bell .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know if there were more than , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't teach MANY SENIORS then .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was n't really involved with the senior class .
So MANY SENIORS were , both of THOSE KIDS THAT ORIGINALLY CAME and at least one other graduated , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not much for remembering years and dates .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION sort of remember about THAT AREA .
THAT AREA 's okay .
Even if MANY SENIORS get just around THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER 's interesting because THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER was still FOUR YEARS before the public schools in BIRMINGHAM really started desegregating .
Well , MANY SENIORS did .
MANY SENIORS would have token persons at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think MANY SENIORS , THE TOKEN PART was probably SUPPOSEDLY THAT YEAR before WE -LSB- integrated -RSB- ; A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think WE did THE TOKEN PART THE NEXT YEAR .
SOME OF US were upset WE did n't do SOME OF US at THE SAME TIME or why WE did n't do SOME OF US before MANY SENIORS .
WE were told that SOME OF US , WE would be subject to lawsuits , and THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO is pretty poor down here compared to many places where there are more MANY CATHOLICS .
THE ENTIRE CONTINENT OF AFRICA is more A CATHOLIC than BIRMINGHAM .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THE ENTIRE CONTINENT OF AFRICA 's about two percent and AFRICA is about six percent .
But still , WE could n't do THE ENTIRE CONTINENT OF AFRICA before , and then SUPPOSEDLY THAT YEAR WE were already at max and so WE did THE ENTIRE CONTINENT OF AFRICA one year later .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION know A CATHOLIC never voiced A CATHOLIC out loud , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've heard a little criticism that WE took in FOUR ? blacks , and some of THE WHITE KIDS did n't get in .
A CATHOLIC thought A CATHOLIC was , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know why A CATHOLIC thought A CATHOLIC should be all these kids were A CATHOLIC .
Why A CATHOLIC thought A CATHOLIC should have the FIRST positions just because A CATHOLIC were white .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION know at THE TIME THEY HAD SUCH A PREMIUM OF SO MANY KIDS THAT WANTED TO GET IN THEY DELIBERATELY DID N'T SELECT THE LOWEST ABILITY KIDS TO KEEP OUT .
A CATHOLIC selected ones that were , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would say , in the college preparatory class .
We 've always tried to keep , make sure THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD is n't going to be just for the elite in intelligence .
So SOME OF THE PARENTS WHOSE KIDS WERE N'T ACCEPTED OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT , WERE UPSET THAT THERE WERE FOUR SPACES GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO WERE N'T WHITE , WHICH I THINK is ridiculous like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION say that SOME OF THE PARENTS WHOSE KIDS WERE N'T ACCEPTED OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT , WERE UPSET THAT THERE WERE FOUR SPACES GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO WERE N'T WHITE , WHICH I THINK would be denied .
Just because SOME OF THE PARENTS WHOSE KIDS WERE N'T ACCEPTED OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT , WERE UPSET THAT THERE WERE FOUR SPACES GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO WERE N'T WHITE , WHICH I THINK 're white SOME OF THE PARENTS WHOSE KIDS WERE N'T ACCEPTED OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT , WERE UPSET THAT THERE WERE FOUR SPACES GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO WERE N'T WHITE , WHICH I THINK 're supposed to be more acceptable than THE OTHERS .
Were THE PARENTS WHOSE KIDS WERE N'T ACCEPTED OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT , WERE UPSET THAT THERE WERE FOUR SPACES GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO WERE N'T WHITE , WHICH I THINK THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY MACHO I 'D SAY PLEASE GOD that seemed to be most likely to sue THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD ?
NO .
Probably would n't have SOME MONEY or whatever .
JUST ONE was JUST ONE , actually JUST ONE was just JUST ONE that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION heard , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION felt like ONE PERSON was voicing A LOT OF OTHERS ' OPINIONS , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just sort of dismissed A LOT OF OTHERS ' OPINIONS as ignorant .
OUR population -LSB- of AN AFRICAN AMERICAN students -RSB- right now-the school would get upset if OUR POPULATION -LSB- OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS -RSB- RIGHT NOW-THE SCHOOL went less than twenty percent , and right now OUR POPULATION -LSB- OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS -RSB- RIGHT NOW-THE SCHOOL 's somewhere between MAYBE AS MANY AS TWENTY and twenty-five percent AN AFRICAN AMERICAN .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think OUR POPULATION -LSB- OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS -RSB- RIGHT NOW-THE SCHOOL 's OUR POPULATION -LSB- OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS -RSB- RIGHT NOW-THE SCHOOL for AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS -RSB- RIGHT NOW-THE SCHOOL to come up with SOME MONEY and to afford tuition .
OUR do have financial aid , but OUR financial aid does n't stretch as much as OUR would like for OUR FINANCIAL AID to .
If A GOOD CATHOLIC come from any of THE FEEDER SCHOOLS , OUR feeder schools , A GOOD CATHOLIC 're eligible for financial aid .
A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't have to be A CATHOLIC .
At ONE TIME ONE TIME was reserved for A CATHOLIC , and then A CATHOLIC decided to help THE GRADE SCHOOLS out ; A CATHOLIC would make A CATHOLIC -LSB- available -RSB- to anyone who was in a A CATHOLIC grade school .
Then if A GOOD CATHOLIC come from A SEPARATE COMMITTEE FOR THAT , A GOOD CATHOLIC 're also eligible for financial aid .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how much A GOOD CATHOLIC get or whatever .
A SEPARATE COMMITTEE FOR THAT 's A SEPARATE COMMITTEE FOR THAT .
THEIR proof is THEIR income tax returns from what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION understand .
So that THEIR really do need THEIR PROOF .
Do YOU think THE TUITION here is relatively high ?
THE TUITION 's high when A GOOD CATHOLIC go free to a public school .
OUR competition , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would say , is double , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think , from what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION understand from THE OTHER SCHOOLS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think Altamont is probably about more than ten thousand .
OUR is somewhere in THE VICINITY OF FIVE THOUSAND .
THE VICINITY OF FIVE THOUSAND might even be SIX OF THEM .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not sure .
INDIAN SPRINGS is probably FIFTEEN or twenty thousand .
INDIAN SPRINGS is INDIAN SPRINGS .
INDIAN SPRINGS 's INDIAN SPRINGS .
THEY have boarding THE FACILITIES there , dorms and everything .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not sure about BRIARWOOD whether THEY is ; A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION suspect BRIARWOOD 's somewhat higher , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how much higher .
THEY pay THEY coaches A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA more than we do .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION know that .
THEIR COACHES A LOT here make a tremendous amount of money in some of THE OTHER SCHOOLS .
Every teacher would love to have EVEN HALF THE SALARY OF THEIR COACHES .
But anyway , EVEN HALF THE SALARY OF THEIR COACHES is high and EVEN HALF THE SALARY OF THEIR COACHES is EVEN HALF THE SALARY OF THEIR COACHES .
THEIR COACHES A LOT 're really trying to get the foundation built up so THEIR COACHES A LOT can give more aid to THEIR KIDS and keep THE TUITION down and to give THE TEACHERS -RSB- A BIGGER SALARY .
We lose a lot of GOOD TEACHERS because of - Of course A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have a lot of FOUR YEARS experience .
But A BIGGER SALARY is between FIFTEEN and twenty thousand dollars A YEAR lower than the public school salary , and when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION retire , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'll get three hundred dollars A MONTH .
GOOD TEACHERS -LSB- public school teachers -RSB- get QUITE A BIT more .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION insurance is sixty-five dollars A MONTH .
THEIRS IS-THEY got upset when GOOD TEACHERS raised THEIRS IS-THEY to SEVEN dollars-the public school teachers , some of HIS TWO BEST FRIENDS WERE , ONE WAS A KID that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have .
We 're talking about GOOD TEACHERS friends , and HIS TWO BEST FRIENDS WERE , ONE WAS A KID ca n't afford to pay seven dollars A MONTH .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought , `` Yeah .
Come to -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL and A GOOD CATHOLIC 'll see what -LSB- unclear -RSB- BUSINESS AND THINGS . ''
So anyway BUSINESS AND THINGS 's that THE TOKEN PART .
Where are we as far as the interview ? A GOOD CATHOLIC want A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION to go back to , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION digressed THE WAY , THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE .
NO .
Really , KIMBERLY HILL was , KIMBERLY HILL just wanted to get some particulars about THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD because KIMBERLY HILL think it would be helpful to know just about the policies and THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE in general .
Like YOU said THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD does n't recruit .
SO do THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE generally come because THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE know about THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD -
MAYBE EVEN THE , what MAYBE EVEN THE , -LSB- unclear -RSB- recruit ATHLETES .
When THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE go out and recruit , THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE recruit from THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE own schools and talk to THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE and all the different activities THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE have .
THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE do n't go to any public schools and recruit .
THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE do have an open house , and SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR do come and look at THE FACILITIES and so on .
But as far as THE STATE athletic associations , SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR do n't want THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE to recruit ATHLETES .
If SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR inquire , THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE tell SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR if A GOOD CATHOLIC really want to be here , A GOOD CATHOLIC have to sit out A YEAR , and then from what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION understand if SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR 're a prospective football player SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR parents are -LSB- not ? -RSB- thrilled SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR 're going to sit out A YEAR .
Usually SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR 're freshman and SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR can , SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR can practice with THE TEAM , but SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR ca n't play .
For the other sports sometimes SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR go to ANOTHER SCHOOL because SOME PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR 're immediately eligible in other places .
ANOTHER SCHOOL probably affects THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE more than ANOTHER SCHOOL does any of THE OTHER PRIVATE SCHOOLS because SEVERAL OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS have grade schools connected with SEVERAL OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS .
So SEVERAL OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS EIGHTH grade just moves into THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR .
But THEM ABOUT IT AND WHAT THEY CAN GET HERE AND WHAT PERHAPS OTHER SCHOOLS CAN NOT PROVIDE have about FIFTEEN or MAYBE AS MANY AS TWENTY feeder schools , and SEVERAL OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS come from all over THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY and transportation is a real problem .
Either SEVERAL OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS have to be dropped off until SEVERAL OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS can drive , and SOME PARENTS do n't like THEIR KIDS driving at age sixteen too for all of that .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think from THE VERY beginning INTEGRATION AND DESEGREGATION was very peaceful .
From what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION understand in SOME OF THE SCHOOLS SOME OF THE SCHOOLS had FOUR FOOTBALL players escorting each kid to class , two in front and TWO behind .
THE COACH told SOME OF THE SCHOOLS SOME OF THE SCHOOLS 'd better not have any incident of anyone interfering with SOME OF THE SCHOOLS , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION suspect FOUR FOOTBALL PLAYERS ESCORTING EACH KID TO CLASS , TWO IN FRONT AND TWO BEHIND probably did n't like SOME OF THE SCHOOLS , but FOUR FOOTBALL PLAYERS ESCORTING EACH KID TO CLASS , TWO IN FRONT AND TWO BEHIND were told to do FOUR FOOTBALL and FOUR FOOTBALL PLAYERS ESCORTING EACH KID TO CLASS , TWO IN FRONT AND TWO BEHIND did do FOUR FOOTBALL .
KIMBERLY HILL 've never heard that story .
Um hmm .
SOME OF THE SCHOOLS was at WEST END .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had a friend that taught at WEST END , and WEST END 's why A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION knew that .
THIS has nothing to do with integration , but THIS 's so typical of how THE SOUTH was in THOSE DAYS .
When JOHN KENNEDY was killed , THIS , SOME OF THE SCHOOLS had a huge celebration at WEST END .
SOME OF THE SCHOOLS were in SOME OF THE SCHOOLS classes whooping and hollering led by THE TEACHERS -RSB- because ONE OF THE TEACHERS THAT WAS MY FRIEND was A CATHOLIC , and MY FRIEND was horrified at ONE OF THE TEACHERS THAT WAS MY FRIEND .
Then A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had another friend later on in A MAGNET SCHOOL .
A MAGNET SCHOOL was n't A MAGNET SCHOOL , but A MAGNET SCHOOL drew from an area where there were a lot of WEALTHY PEOPLE ON THE SOUTHSIDE .
WEALTHY PEOPLE ON THE SOUTHSIDE were WHOOPING AND HOLLERING AND EVERYTHING -LSB- about the JOHN KENNEDY assassination -RSB- .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL and probably the black schools were CARROLL AND PROBABLY THE BLACK SCHOOLS .
-LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL said later when -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL went home and saw the TV coverage , -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL was mortified at the way CARROLL AND PROBABLY THE BLACK SCHOOLS celebrated .
HE AND HIS FRIENDS ALSO , another friend who was in another school , another area .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not exactly sure , but HE AND HIS FRIENDS ALSO were all celebrating .
Was this President JOHN KENNEDY -LSB- as opposed to Robert Kennedy -RSB- ?
PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN DALLAS .
HE AND HIS FRIENDS ALSO thought DALLAS was wonderful .
So DALLAS was DALLAS .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know if DALLAS was because of the integration part or PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN DALLAS . was PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN DALLAS . or PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN DALLAS . was A CATHOLIC or WHAT .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just knew that this was -
KIMBERLY HILL did talk with A DOCTOR WHO INTEGRATED RAMSEY HIGH BACK IN ' 63 .
A DOCTOR WHO INTEGRATED RAMSEY HIGH BACK IN ' 63 said A DOCTOR WHO INTEGRATED RAMSEY HIGH BACK IN ' 63 remembers STUDENTS TELLING HIM THE DAY KENNEDY was killed , yeah , YOU 're next .
YOU 're next .
Really .
Well , STUDENTS TELLING HIM THE DAY KENNEDY 's where MY FRIEND graduated -LSB- from -RSB- .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had two friends who were sort of CONTEMPORARIES OF MINE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not sure where THE OTHER ONE went to school .
THE OTHER ONE was n't at Ramsey .
CONTEMPORARIES OF MINE were also celebrating , but WEST END went totally wild from what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION understand .
No more NO CLASSES .
We had AN OLD TEACHER , golly , AN OLD TEACHER was-she retired from THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM , and CONTEMPORARIES OF MINE say AN OLD TEACHER ran any school AN OLD TEACHER was in .
THE PRINCIPAL 'S , THE PRINCIPAL 'S had more power than any principal .
Then THE PRINCIPAL 'S went to work in a A CATHOLIC grade school as a librarian , and then A CATHOLIC were getting better and better , and A CATHOLIC felt like A CATHOLIC needed a real librarian .
So THE PRINCIPAL 'S lived right near the old school .
In fact all THE PRINCIPAL 'S had to do was cross ONE street to get to ONE .
THE PRINCIPAL 'S asked if THE PRINCIPAL 'S could work THERE , OR WORK FOR US .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know what THERE , OR WORK FOR US paid THE PRINCIPAL 'S , almost nothing .
THE PRINCIPAL 'S thought it was wonderful THE PRINCIPAL 'S could eat in the cafeteria free .
THE PRINCIPAL 'S was quite wealthy .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think SOME OF THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS said that SOME OF THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS had the same clothes that SOME OF THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS wore at PHILLIPS ' .
SOME OF THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS does n't believe in spending a lot of money .
But one of the students and one of the teachers had A WRITING CLASS and had to talk about someone so SOME OF THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS interviewed SOME OF THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS at PHILLIPS ' .
What SOME OF THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS did at Phillips-she said all these people at WEST END when THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS were integrating , THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS were out WHOOPING AND HOLLERING AND EVERYTHING , THEIR CARS and riding on the top of THEIR CARS and all that sort of JUST STUFF LIKE THAT .
No schooling , NO CLASSES were going on .
THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS came to PHILLIPS ' to get THEIR KIDS to come out and join THEIR KIDS , and THE PRINCIPAL 'S was so nervous PHILLIPS ' came to A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY , ca n't think of A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY name right now , and THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know what to do .
OUR kids are about ready to walk out of school , and THE PRINCIPAL 'S says `` get A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION the student council president and all the football players . ''
So THEIR KIDS all met and THE PRINCIPAL 'S said , `` Are OUR going to let THE WEST END PEOPLE tell THE WEST END PEOPLE ? '' THE PRINCIPAL 'S said so , THEIR KIDS went out and got THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN , march back in , and the newspapers wanted to interview THE PRINCIPAL 'S and THE PRINCIPAL 'S protected THE PRINCIPAL 'S .
All the newspapers said is THIS LITTLE OLD GRAY-HAIRED LADY and a bunch of big boys got THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN to come back into the school at THE SAME TIME .
So THIS LITTLE OLD GRAY-HAIRED LADY sort of saved PHILLIPS ' reputation by appealing to the rivalry between the TWO big public schools .
So PHILLIPS ' REPUTATION BY APPEALING TO THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO BIG PUBLIC SCHOOLS was PHILLIPS ' REPUTATION BY APPEALING TO THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO BIG PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know if THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN integrated , but WEST END was WEST END .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how long THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN were out running around in THEIR CARS and so on .
WEST END was just like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said no schooling going on at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how long WEST END lasted .
How did THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE change here after desegregation ?
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't see THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE .
WE had , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know if THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE were exceptional , but THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE right away accepted .
As A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said on THE PHONE -LSB- to the interviewer -RSB- A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm sure that individually THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE might have had some incidences that were unpleasant , but THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE never brought THE PHONE -LSB- to WE .
If THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE had , THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE -LSB- THE TEACHERS -RSB- would 've dealt very severely with THE PHONE -LSB- .
MANY OF THE TEACHERS were actually already pro-integration .
So MANY OF THE TEACHERS were thrilled .
MANY OF THE TEACHERS thought WE were criticizing THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION guess if WE did have any bigoted teachers , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION suspect WE probably did , MANY OF THE TEACHERS kept very quiet about THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD .
MANY OF THE TEACHERS , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think probably would 've gone overboard not to show any problems , any - .
Like maybe if ONE OTHER STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL IN HER CLASS THAT COULD VOTE almost made AN A that student would get AN A OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT to go to the other extreme of EVEN GRADING or EVEN GRADING conduct or whatever AN A OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT said AN A OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT would probably tread very carefully .
Not with THOSE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE STUDENTS , BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTER that WE got some very good athletes .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think that helps when A GOOD CATHOLIC 're cheering for A TEAM and A GOOD CATHOLIC see one of your best people on the field or on THE COURT is AN AFRICAN AMERICAN .
A GOOD CATHOLIC 're going to relax a little bit towards A TEAM .
WE had A VERY GOOD ATHLETE , very quickly A VERY GOOD ATHLETE was A VERY GOOD ATHLETE , and A VERY GOOD ATHLETE 's known around HERE fairly well because A VERY GOOD ATHLETE 's in some of the plays , some of the TV shows and JUST STUFF LIKE THAT .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A VERY GOOD ATHLETE has some kind of an entertainment company , theatre company , or film company .
A VERY GOOD ATHLETE was laughing .
A VERY GOOD ATHLETE came back and talked to the PTA .
A VERY GOOD ATHLETE was laughing at THE FACT that how A VERY GOOD ATHLETE was sort of mischievous with this other kid .
There was A WHITE KID .
THEY were regularly on THE BENCH NEXT TO THE PRINCIPAL 'S OFFICE being seen for what THEY mischievous thing was .
A WHITE KID laughed about A WHITE KID seat on THE BENCH NEXT TO THE PRINCIPAL 'S OFFICE .
A WHITE KID was so accepted , and A WHITE KID got to AUBURN where A WHITE KID got A FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIP .
A WHITE KID never said A DIFFERENT SCENE publicly but privately A WHITE KID said how mean FOUR FOOTBALL PLAYERS ESCORTING EACH KID TO CLASS , TWO IN FRONT AND TWO BEHIND were to A WHITE KID even though A WHITE KID was playing for AUBURN .
By THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER A WHITE KID was A WHITE KID , and A WHITE KID played professional football , and FOUR FOOTBALL PLAYERS ESCORTING EACH KID TO CLASS , TWO IN FRONT AND TWO BEHIND stopped being mean to A WHITE KID then .
But A WHITE KID said , A WHITE KID talked about how A WHITE KID was accepted at -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL , and all of a sudden , A WHITE KID was expecting the same thing at AUBURN since FOUR FOOTBALL PLAYERS ESCORTING EACH KID TO CLASS , TWO IN FRONT AND TWO BEHIND recruited A WHITE KID and A WHITE KID got A FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIP and how different A FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIP was .
A WHITE KID said , oh , A DIFFERENT SCENE is A DIFFERENT SCENE .
A WHITE KID is , A WHITE KID , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think to A WHITE KID day A WHITE KID has a lot of affection for -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL .
Every so often A WHITE KID comes back , and HIS NEPHEW , -LSB- and -RSB- HIS NEPHEW two sisters also came here , and HIS NEPHEW , -LSB- AND -RSB- HIS TWO SISTERS were good in volleyball .
HIS NEPHEW , -LSB- AND -RSB- HIS TWO SISTERS were HIS NEPHEW , -LSB- AND -RSB- HIS TWO SISTERS .
THE SON OF ONE OF THE SISTERS came back and THE SON OF ONE OF THE SISTERS played basketball , and THE SON OF ONE OF THE SISTERS played for ENSLEY , ALABAMA .
THE SON OF ONE OF THE SISTERS graduated , but THE SON OF ONE OF THE SISTERS was sort of like the sixth man on THE TEAM .
One of our players , one of the persons when THE SON OF ONE OF THE SISTERS was very good in the tournament and so on , HIS NEPHEW , -LSB- AND -RSB- HIS TWO SISTERS said something about THE SON OF ONE OF THE SISTERS being stolen from THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought `` STOLEN ? '' STOLEN uncle went there .
STOLEN sister , STOLEN mother went there .
STOLEN aunt went there .
STOLEN older sister came to -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL .
In all , STOLEN was never in THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM .
WE still get a lot of remarks .
Like one time A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION remember WE won the 6-A championship .
One of the men as one of the teachers was leaving said , `` How much do A GOOD CATHOLIC pay those guys out on that court to play basketball for A GOOD CATHOLIC ? '' A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was telling THE COACH that , and THE COACH just shook THE COACH head .
THE COACH said , `` A GOOD CATHOLIC know every one of those players has TWO PARENTS THAT LIVED TOGETHER and TWO PARENTS THAT LIVED TOGETHER both worked . ''
Like one was A POLICEMAN and MY OLDER SISTER SAID , `` WELL was A TEACHER 'S .
`` A POLICEMAN AND THE MOTHER were all , '' A POLICEMAN said , `` A POLICEMAN AND THE MOTHER can easily afford A VERY DANGEROUS THING FOR ANYONE , ANY SCHOOL TO DO I THINK TO DO THAT .
WE do n't have to pay anyone . ''
A VERY DANGEROUS THING FOR ANYONE , ANY SCHOOL TO DO I THINK TO DO THAT would be A VERY DANGEROUS THING FOR ANYONE , ANY SCHOOL TO DO I THINK TO DO THAT .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think once A POLICEMAN AND THE MOTHER started becoming more integrated into THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD and the activities , A POLICEMAN AND THE MOTHER became cheerleaders and dance team people and all the sports that WE did n't hear SO MUCH OF IT against SO MUCH OF IT .
Like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION say A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION mentioned this earlier , WE always had A GIRLS ' vice president and A BOYS ' vice president to make sure that THE GIRLS-AT ONE TIME WE 'd have ONLY ONE GIRL ON THE STUDENT COUNCIL , SECRETARY .
THE GIRLS-AT ONE TIME was always A VERY GOOD STUDENT position .
If THE TREASURER went to THE BOTH BOY , then WE would have ONLY ONE GIRL ON THE STUDENT COUNCIL , SECRETARY , and THE PRINCIPAL 'S did n't like ONE .
So THE TREASURER decided to expand ONE to four offices .
A GIRLS ' vice president , so WE 'd always have at least two .
The secretary and A GIRLS ' vice president .
So THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS INTEGRATED WE , one of the years that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was A BOYS ' vice president .
At that time to be elected A GOOD CATHOLIC would have to have tremendous white support because there was probably maybe only sixty-five or seventy in THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD .
Maybe we would have 800 or 900 at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS .
HERMAN TAYLOR was , AND THEN THE NEXT YEAR HERMAN TAYLOR , who is cardiologist and now belongs at University of Mississippi .
HERMAN TAYLOR is THE CHAIR , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION guess A GOOD CATHOLIC 'd call THE CHAIR .
, AND THEN THE NEXT YEAR HERMAN TAYLOR created a chair of A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think public medicine or something like THAT WHEN I 'M THINKING ABOUT GETTING ALWAYS PRESSING , and HERMAN TAYLOR was the FIRST chair .
HERMAN TAYLOR invited a bunch of people , and HERMAN TAYLOR invited HERMAN TAYLOR high school teacher that was A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE .
HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT WAS A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE was n't going .
HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT WAS A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE felt like HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT WAS A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE could n't go because to get to JACKSON , Mississippi .
HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT WAS A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE did n't want to drive .
To get to JACKSON , Mississippi HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT WAS A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE would have to fly into DALLAS and come back , and JACKSON , MISSISSIPPI was like eight-hour or nine-hour trip , and HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT WAS A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE would have to take off three days .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , `` oh heck , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'll drive A GOOD CATHOLIC .
Take a personal day and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'll drive A GOOD CATHOLIC . ''
So JACKSON did n't think HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT WAS A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE was coming , and it was SO FUN TO SEE HIS FACE WHEN HE REALIZED THAT HE TURNED , JACKSON turned back , and then JACKSON realized SO FUN TO SEE HIS FACE WHEN HE REALIZED THAT HE TURNED was Miss Flannigan .
JACKSON said , `` MISS FLANNIGAN ! '' HE WAS SO GLAD to see MISS FLANNIGAN ! '' HE WAS SO GLAD .
But JACKSON talked about A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE in JACKSON life .
So by THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER JACKSON was there , we regularly had STUDENT COUNCIL .
To A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER 's THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER .
THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER 's THE STUDENT COUNCIL THAT GIVES THE REAL LEADERSHIP .
Student councils almost have all been integrated .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think LAST YEAR 'S , WHO WAS IT ? A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think ONE OF THE TOP ONES , THE PRESIDENT AND GIRLS ' AND BOYS ' VICE PRESIDENT were ONE OF THE TOP ONES , THE PRESIDENT AND GIRLS ' AND BOYS ' VICE PRESIDENT .
ONE OF THEM was black , and THE NEXT YEAR we 'll have one also .
ONE OF MY STUDENTS WHO IS -LSB- BLACK -RSB- , A GIRLS ' VICE PRESIDENT will be ONE OF MY STUDENTS WHO IS -LSB- BLACK -RSB- .
ONE OF THEM sounds like THE ALUMS keep in touch with the school A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA .
Yes .
THE ALUMS try to keep THEM , it was really difficult when THE ALUMS built THIS NEW SCHOOL because then THE ALUMS wanted THEM to realize that as A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION told THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN , if A GOOD CATHOLIC go into a new house , THE FAMILY does n't change .
The same people change .
THIS NEW SCHOOL really griped A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION when THE ALUMS were in THIS OLD BUILDING , and THIS NEW SCHOOL was sort of dark and THIS NEW SCHOOL was n't air-conditioned .
It was really warm when THE ALUMS began school .
When THE ALUMS got to THIS OLD BUILDING , -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL a really good school and THE ALUMS brought THE SAME TEACHERS , THE SAME CURRICULUM , THE SAME CURRICULUM .
A NICE BUILDING LIKE THIS AND AIR-CONDITIONED was A NICE BUILDING LIKE THIS AND AIR-CONDITIONED was A NICE BUILDING LIKE THIS AND AIR-CONDITIONED .
The football field was n't THREE miles from THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD .
THE ALUMS had AN AUDITORIUM INSTEAD OF A GYM with a stage on AN AUDITORIUM INSTEAD OF A GYM .
But SOME OF THEM THAT WE WERE DISCONNECTED .
So in THE SUMMER I BELIEVE THE ALUMS have all kinds of THE REUNIONS .
SOME OF THEM THAT WE WERE DISCONNECTED give SOME OF THEM THAT WE WERE DISCONNECTED the school free .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm sure SOME OF THEM THAT WE WERE DISCONNECTED pay the janitors and the maintenance people and whatever food .
Obviously SOME OF THEM THAT WE WERE DISCONNECTED do n't pay SOME OF THEM THAT WE WERE DISCONNECTED .
But THE FACILITIES are free to keep SOME OF THEM THAT WE WERE DISCONNECTED connected to THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD .
And YOU THAT REGULARLY COMES OUT , ALUMNI have A NEWSPAPER THAT I 'LL HAVE TO GET ONE FOR YOU THAT REGULARLY COMES OUT , ALUMNI .
Actually YOU THAT REGULARLY COMES OUT , ALUMNI have A SISTER WHO IS , SHE WO N'T ADMIT IT , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A SISTER WHO IS , SHE WO N'T ADMIT IT 's ninety and most of A SISTER WHO IS , SHE WO N'T ADMIT IT teaching career has been at -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL .
A SISTER WHO IS , SHE WO N'T ADMIT IT always keep up with THE GRADUATES , the births and the deaths , and A SISTER WHO IS , SHE WO N'T ADMIT IT 'll come to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION and say , because A GOOD CATHOLIC know A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've been here a long time , do A GOOD CATHOLIC remember such and such ? A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , A SISTER WHO IS , SHE WO N'T ADMIT IT .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't recall THE GRADUATES .
`` Well , -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL graduated in 1940 . ''
Sister , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was n't here at THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER .
`` Oh , yeah .
Golly . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 's been here THE WHOLE TIME .
Well , A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER would send A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER to another school , and A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER 'd work A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER way back to -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL , and A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER loves THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD and when A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER could no longer teach A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER became sort of alumni director .
So A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER 's on THE PHONE ALL DAY with people that are calling in when THEY were married and when THEY husbands die or when THEIR HUSBANDS 're ill , any honors and that magazine is called , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THE PHONE ALL DAY 's called CARROLL LIFE .
THE PHONE ALL DAY goes out to all the graduates who want THE PHONE ALL DAY , that the mailings make sure THE PHONE ALL DAY 's out and everything 's in THE PHONE ALL DAY and all the dates are right and all the things are spelled .
A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER 's in charge of any of THE REUNIONS , and a lot of TIMES THE ORDER THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE do n't quite know what THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE should do .
THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE want a reunion , so A COUPLE OF TIMES THE ORDER 'll tell THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE A GOOD CATHOLIC 've got to do THIS and A GOOD CATHOLIC should do THIS and do n't forget to do THIS and get , sort of walks THIS through .
But then for MAYBE AS MANY AS TWENTY THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE pretty much know .
THE WHOLE TIME THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE always invite THE FACULTY .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION try to go when THE WHOLE TIME 's here .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't want to go to SOME OTHER PLACE WHATEVER .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION try to drop in on SOME OTHER PLACE WHATEVER .
But THEY have a chapel , and THEY have THE MASS FOR US , and THEY have a dinner after THE MASS FOR US .
SOME OF THEM come to mass .
SOME OF THEM 's always on a Saturday .
So that counts for Catholics for a Sunday .
Kill TWO birds with one stone .
Then THEY try to get one of the priests that served here THEY 's still in the area to say THE MASS FOR US and say a few words and have A MEAL after .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION go to THE MASS FOR US , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm never sure if A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm invited to A MEAL or if A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm supposed to pay .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION decline A MEAL .
If someone offers to give A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION YOUR REUNION-YOU COME EVERY FIVE OR TEN YEARS , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION might do YOUR REUNION-YOU COME EVERY FIVE OR TEN YEARS .
But so A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION talk to THEM and whatever .
But THEM get upset when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't come .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION say , YOUR REUNION-YOU COME EVERY FIVE OR TEN YEARS 's just A GOOD CATHOLIC reunion-you come every ONLY FIVE or ten years , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've got to -LSB- work here everyday . -RSB-
THEM probably have EIGHT or ten in THE SUMMER I BELIEVE that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could go to .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION ca n't be rushing up here all the time .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do try to come to THEM .
So THEM tie that to THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD also when THEM can .
So THEM and a lot of OUR alumni send THEM kids here .
THEM want the same experience for THEM kids . -LSB- INTERCOM AND INTERRUPTION -RSB- But anyway , THEM try to do INTERCOM AND INTERRUPTION .
A DIFFERENT SUBJECT FROM MY SPANISH OUR had A TEACHER 'S parent walk through .
THEM just call to schedule THEM kids , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was doing all A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION stuff trying to get - .
Because OUR have to hand out course expectations and all this sort of stuff .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was trying to find A DIFFERENT SUBJECT FROM MY SPANISH .
A DIFFERENT SUBJECT FROM MY SPANISH was A DIFFERENT SUBJECT FROM MY SPANISH .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION teach SOCIAL STUDIES and Spanish , and when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION finally looked up , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION saw this person whose kids A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION taught , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION mean who was THE PARENT OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX OF MY EX-STUDENTS IN THE CLASS .
They had just all come here that THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , `` Holy smokes .
Look THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION feel like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION should start A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION subject .
Then THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE laughed .
Then in the middle of A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION speech someone was talking .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , `` Fleming , A GOOD CATHOLIC still are talking .
A GOOD CATHOLIC are just THE SAME DEAL , THE SAME KIDS , THE TALKATIVE ONES , THE ONES THAT DID N'T PAY ATTENTION .
A GOOD CATHOLIC just ca n't get over THE SAME DEAL , THE SAME KIDS , THE TALKATIVE ONES , THE ONES THAT DID N'T PAY ATTENTION can A GOOD CATHOLIC ? '' THEY all laughed at THE SAME DEAL , THE SAME KIDS , THE TALKATIVE ONES , THE ONES THAT DID N'T PAY ATTENTION because THE SAME DEAL , THE SAME KIDS , THE TALKATIVE ONES , THE ONES THAT DID N'T PAY ATTENTION was THE SAME DEAL , THE SAME KIDS , THE TALKATIVE ONES , THE ONES THAT DID N'T PAY ATTENTION .
THEY 're still -
STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION .
Yeah .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would , when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was A NEW TEACHER , someone was talking about A WHITE KID that STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . corrected for talking and made A NEW TEACHER stay after school and STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . 're not going to talk anymore .
STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . swore STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . were n't going to talk .
THIS OLD NUN said , `` Honey , '' THIS OLD NUN said , `` this is THE DAUGHTER OF SO AND SO .
THIS OLD NUN could n't keep THIS OLD NUN mouth shut .
HER MOUTH SHUT 's in the genes .
THIS OLD NUN 's going to keep on talking . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought , HER MOUTH SHUT is awful talking ABOUT-ALREADY MADE UP YOUR IDEA , ABOUT-ALREADY MADE UP YOUR IDEA mind about A WHITE KID .
Then the longer A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION teach A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION realize HER MOUTH SHUT 's true .
THIS NEW TEACHER SHE WO N'T DO THAT OR HE wo n't do HER MOUTH SHUT anymore .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought , well , OH YEAH sure .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't say OH YEAH .
Just like HIS FATHER 'S , THIS NEW TEACHER SHE WO N'T DO THAT OR HE says -
Because NOW YOU 'VE SEEN -
This , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION probably should n't put this on tape , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION will .
THIS GUY , THEIR NAMES .
THIS ONE WOMAN came to talk about THIS ONE WOMAN son who 's getting a D in Spanish .
THIS ONE WOMAN just could not understand .
-LSB- THIS ONE WOMAN asked , -RSB- `` What can A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do to help HER SON WHO 'S GETTING A D IN SPANISH ? , '' and at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS , there 's very little PARENTS THAT SORT OF I DO N'T KNOW can do as far as helping PARENTS THAT SORT OF I DO N'T KNOW in Spanish .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION looked at THIS ONE WOMAN , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION realized that THIS ONE WOMAN married , at the time A WHITE KID was in school , the class idiot .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION wanted to say , `` Lady there is nothing A GOOD CATHOLIC can do . ''
FIFTEEN or twenty years ago A GOOD CATHOLIC married THE WRONG PERSON .
THE WRONG PERSON inherited HIS FATHER 'S genes .
THE WRONG PERSON was n't really stupid as far as A WHITE KID was , but THE WRONG PERSON was sort of like , THE WRONG PERSON always deliberately tried to be , pretend THE WRONG PERSON was dumber than what THE WRONG PERSON was .
THE WRONG PERSON was sort of the class clown .
THE WRONG PERSON was n't really THE WRONG PERSON .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION brought A GOOD CATHOLIC A FLOWER .
A GOOD CATHOLIC want A FLOWER , SOME LITTLE TULIP or something like SOME LITTLE TULIP .
Just to get a laugh or WHATEVER .
But what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was thinking , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just do n't know .
A GOOD CATHOLIC 've done everything A GOOD CATHOLIC could and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've done everything A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't say that to HER obviously .
But HER -
Yeah .
KIMBERLY HILL do n't know how HER would 've taken that .
NO , NO would n't - no , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would never say anything like THE OPPOSITE OF COURSE .
But A GOOD CATHOLIC see the characteristics that THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN and THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES , and sometimes THE OPPOSITE OF COURSE explains why A WHITE KID is so conscientious or so quiet or so shy or so talkative or a born leader just like A WHITE KID parent is .
Sometimes THE OPPOSITE OF COURSE 's totally THE OPPOSITE OF COURSE because THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN 're not totally THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES .
And A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION really thought , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was dreading THE DAY WHEN I WOULD GET THE KIDS OF MY FORMER STUDENTS .
But when THE DAY WHEN I WOULD GET THE KIDS OF MY FORMER STUDENTS finally happened , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION really did n't mind THE DAY WHEN I WOULD GET THE KIDS OF MY FORMER STUDENTS at all because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION felt A FREEDOM TO TALK TO THOSE PARENTS THAT I DO NOT FEEL WITH THE OTHER KIDS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION feel like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can say-you have to be very careful when A GOOD CATHOLIC 're A TEACHER 'S .
A GOOD CATHOLIC ca n't outright say anything .
A GOOD CATHOLIC have to say `` maybe A GOOD CATHOLIC ought to , maybe A TEACHER 'S friends are n't MAYBE EVEN THE , maybe A TEACHER 'S 's spending TOO MUCH TIME with A TEACHER 'S friends , and actually A TEACHER 'S 's spending TOO MUCH TIME with the wrong friends , '' but A GOOD CATHOLIC ca n't ever say that .
A GOOD CATHOLIC have to sort of couch , give HIS TWO BEST FRIENDS WERE , ONE WAS A KID a few hints .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION always felt more free with THE PARENTS OF FORMER , THE PARENTS THAT ARE FORMER STUDENTS .
A TEACHER 'S 's running with the wrong crowd .
THE PARENTS OF FORMER , THE PARENTS THAT ARE FORMER STUDENTS should , A GOOD CATHOLIC should try to steer A TEACHER 'S away , or A TEACHER 'S 's definitely not doing this or A TEACHER 'S 's doing such and such .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can let A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION guard down because THE PARENTS OF FORMER , THE PARENTS THAT ARE FORMER STUDENTS know ME AND THE KIDS know ME AND THE KIDS and THE FAMILY , and so that part is good .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION feel more free with THE PARENTS OF FORMER , THE PARENTS THAT ARE FORMER STUDENTS , but A GOOD CATHOLIC 've really got to be careful .
We had A CONFERENCE once where A TEACHER 'S said , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A TEACHER 'S 's just lazy because sometimes A TEACHER 'S does really well on tests when A TEACHER 'S SOCIAL STUDIES and sometimes A TEACHER 'S does n't because A TEACHER 'S has n't done A TEACHER 'S homework .
A TEACHER 'S has n't studied .
ONE PARENT 'S got very upset .
`` ONE PARENT 'S 's not lazy .
Sometimes ONE PARENT 'S chooses not to do HIS HOMEWORK .
But ONE PARENT 'S 's not lazy . ''
Well , WE said , oh , okay .
ONE PARENT 'S chooses not to do HIS HOMEWORK .
WE can say that .
So YOU just have to figure out why ONE PARENT 'S chooses that .
Yeah .
ONE PARENT 'S does n't want to .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION feel , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION like THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've taught THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES now .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION feel sometimes THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE 's hard if THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES 're THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES , but on some of these days where THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS come into THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD , A GOOD CATHOLIC get to , THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES 'll introduce A GOOD CATHOLIC .
Hi , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm so and so .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was so and so .
Then A GOOD CATHOLIC say , OH yeah .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can see OH .
Do YOU feel like MY FORMER STUDENTS here are sheltered from bad influences ?
Oh there are bad influences in every school .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't care how CHRISTIAN MY FORMER STUDENTS say MY FORMER STUDENTS are .
Maybe A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think at -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL if A GOOD CATHOLIC 're A LITTLE BIT different , A GOOD CATHOLIC 're A LITTLE BIT protected from that whether A GOOD CATHOLIC 're A GOOD CATHOLIC .
A GOOD CATHOLIC know SOME KIDS almost seem sort of autistic .
SOME KIDS were really not autistic , but SOME KIDS seem THAT WAY .
SOME KIDS do n't have a connection with SOME KIDS .
WE can control that by making sure that SOME KIDS are n't made THEIR OWN FAULT or are n't razzed or anything like WE .
If WE know that happens , SOME KIDS will be dealt with from the administration or from A TEACHER 'S .
WE have , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION guess , A FREEDOM TO TALK TO THOSE PARENTS THAT I DO NOT FEEL WITH THE OTHER KIDS to send A WHITE KID out on SOME ERRAND and say , `` A GOOD CATHOLIC 're doing such and such .
THIS is going to stop right now and do n't A GOOD CATHOLIC ever say THIS or do THIS or whatever . ''
WE can appeal to THIS CHRISTIAN principles and so on .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION mean , when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was in GRADE SCHOOL , if anyone picked on anyone THIS OLD NUN would send THIS on SOME ERRAND and pre-arrange SOME ERRAND with another teacher and tell WE that if WE did n't stop SOME ERRAND , WE were all going to hell very soon and THIS had better never happen again .
`` A GOOD CATHOLIC 're not being A GOOD CATHOLIC and a good Christian '' or WHATEVER , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A WHITE KID will probably notice from THEN on the whole atmosphere changed .
WE do n't say that to A CATHOLIC , but WE can appeal to A CATHOLIC , fuss at A CATHOLIC perhaps more than maybe A CATHOLIC could in another school .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm sure A CATHOLIC possibly do that in any private school .
So WE do have THEIR KIDS .
WE have two that are LITTLE PEOPLE , LITTLE PEOPLE .
LITTLE PEOPLE are both very well liked .
LITTLE PEOPLE personality also , but some that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS send LITTLE PEOPLE there because LITTLE PEOPLE feel like LITTLE PEOPLE 're going to be A LITTLE BIT more protected than LITTLE PEOPLE would in another school .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do think there is that possibility .
On THE PHONE ALL DAY YOU said , for THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS , YOU could appeal to THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS faith and tell THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS THE CATHOLIC STUDENTS 're being bad but for THE NON-CATHOLICS STUDENTS YOU have to try different tactics .
Um hmm .
This happened MAYBE TWO YEARS ago .
TWO kids were talking during mass , and TWO KIDS were talking right after communion , and THE NON-CATHOLICS STUDENTS believe A GOOD CATHOLIC 're receiving the body and blood of Christ .
So the one kid A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had in class .
The other one A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't . -LSB- intercom -RSB- And so A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION kept HER after mass , and the FIRST thing A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said was `` are A GOOD CATHOLIC A CATHOLIC ? '' HER said , yes .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , `` Do A GOOD CATHOLIC realize and A GOOD CATHOLIC went to communion ? '' HER said , `` yes . ''
`` Do A GOOD CATHOLIC realize THE MOST INTIMATE THING YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE is THE MOST INTIMATE THING YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE ? '' A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , `` The SECOND most intimate thing will be when A GOOD CATHOLIC marry , '' which sure A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said that .
`` A GOOD CATHOLIC will be able to have sexual relations with A GOOD CATHOLIC husband . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said THE MOST INTIMATE THING YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE was THE MOST INTIMATE THING YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE .
`` If A GOOD CATHOLIC have nothing to say to Jesus , then pray for A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
A GOOD CATHOLIC have no problem with any of NO CLASSES , any of THE FAMILY , any of A GOOD CATHOLIC friends , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do have , and will A GOOD CATHOLIC pray for A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION during the communion ? '' Now if THE FAMILY had been not A CATHOLIC , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would 've said THE MOST INTIMATE THING YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE is THE MOST INTIMATE THING YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE .
When A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION go to A GOOD CATHOLIC church , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION respect A GOOD CATHOLIC church , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do exactly what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm supposed to do and what the rest of THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION are doing , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION want A GOOD CATHOLIC to respect THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO .
So THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO would be , THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE would be THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would let the Catholic THEIR KIDS really have THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO big time , and the others A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would talk to about THAT RESPECT that THEIR KIDS would understand .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think WE do have THEIR KIDS .
WE have a Hindu teacher for example , and WE do have OTHER KIDS THAT HAVE NO RELIGION or irregularly WE have a Jewish kid in THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know individually what OTHER KIDS THAT HAVE NO RELIGION are or who OTHER KIDS THAT HAVE NO RELIGION are or whatever when A GOOD CATHOLIC 're in class .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm thrilled when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION learn all OTHER KIDS THAT HAVE NO RELIGION names frankly .
But when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would approach OTHER KIDS THAT HAVE NO RELIGION in THE DISCIPLINE , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would approach OTHER KIDS THAT HAVE NO RELIGION differently if THE DISCIPLINE 's applicable .
Like if someone is talking , that does n't matter .
But if THE DISCIPLINE 's something else more serious and more of A MORAL NATURE , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION might reproach A CATHOLIC differently than one that was n't A CATHOLIC .
Let THE DISCIPLINE talk some about YOU teaching , and were there any ways that YOU think YOU lessons changed after desegregation ?
MY LESSONS changed .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think MY CLASS , A GIRL , let 'S see .
THE PAST OF ALL THE , most of the time A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have a mixture of OUR STUDENTS .
THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had all white , and in A WAY A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was glad and in A WAY A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was n't glad .
THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR does n't , WE do n't choose WE students .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION tell the students A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't choose WE and WE do n't choose A GOOD CATHOLIC .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION probably let the white students have THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR A LITTLE BIT harder than if THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR were mixed maybe .
What subject is THIS ?
THIS would be government .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would be more likely to be A LITTLE BIT more frank when SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK are going on in government than A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would with if A LITTLE BIT was A LITTLE BIT , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION feel like .
When A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION got to ECONOMICS A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was so glad OUR governor said that OUR tax system in ENSLEY , ALABAMA was immoral .
A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't generally hear a REPUBLICAN official saying that about taxes .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was quite glad to hear that because if SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK have REPUBLICAN tendencies , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION feel like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm on THE RIGHT SIDE LETTING THEM .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION really , THE RIGHT SIDE LETTING THEM 's hard to , THE RIGHT SIDE LETTING THEM 's hard for A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION to at TIMES THE ORDER to teach social justice and INTEGRATION AND SEGREGATION and things of A MORAL NATURE , but when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can work A MORAL NATURE in , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION will try to work THE RIGHT SIDE LETTING THEM in .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION try to work THE RIGHT SIDE LETTING THEM in in such a way that makes SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK realize -LSB- if -RSB- SOME OF THEM are n't convinced of SOME OF THEM morally SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK will be convinced of THE RIGHT SIDE LETTING THEM economically because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION pointed out to SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK that THE SOUTH was in a stalemate when SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK were ignoring the contributions of all these talented AN AFRICAN AMERICAN people .
SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK could n't get the jobs that SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK deserved .
SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK could n't get the money SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK deserved .
SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK could n't get the political positions that SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK deserved , and when SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK started integrating and integrated more , SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK 's when more prosperity came to THE STATE .
In ECONOMICS A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION point out what we call the opportunity cost .
And if A GOOD CATHOLIC 're on THE CURVE , THE CURVE means A GOOD CATHOLIC 're employing all A GOOD CATHOLIC resources in labor , capital and management , entrepreneurship to THE CURVE fullest extent .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION always point out now on THE GRAPH WHERE WOULD YOU PUT SEGREGATION OR WHERE WOULD YOU PUT PREJUDICE , AND IT 'S EITHER GOING TO BE POINTED OUT IN THE CLASSROOM OR IT 'S GOING TO BE A TEST ITEM WHERE THEY HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT THEMSELVES .
THE GRAPH WHERE WOULD YOU PUT SEGREGATION OR WHERE WOULD YOU PUT PREJUDICE , AND IT 'S EITHER GOING TO BE POINTED OUT IN THE CLASSROOM OR IT 'S GOING TO BE A TEST ITEM WHERE THEY HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT THEMSELVES 's going to be not on THE LINE , WHICH MEANS THE ECONOMY IS NOT REACHING ITS POTENTIAL but inside THE LINE , WHICH MEANS THE ECONOMY IS NOT REACHING ITS POTENTIAL when THE LINE , WHICH MEANS THE ECONOMY IS NOT REACHING ITS POTENTIAL does that .
So there are a variety of times in economics and government A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can point out to SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK how segregation kept THE SOUTH behind for MANY , MANY YEARS .
Also A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION point out really stupid statements that our politicians have made during MANY , MANY YEARS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION sort of remember THOSE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE STUDENTS , BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTER and probably do THOSE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE STUDENTS , BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTER in such a way that THOSE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE STUDENTS , BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTER make THEIR OWN FAULT , too .
But there 's a fair amount of kids here whose parents came from THE NORTH THAT ARE CATHOLIC and are used to A CATHOLIC schools and the cost of A CATHOLIC schools .
As far as discipline in A WRITING CLASS , having A LITTLE BIT , in Spanish A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION forget .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't think of TWO BOYS AND TWO GIRLS , different variety of OUR STUDENTS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'll think sometimes do A GOOD CATHOLIC have any people of AN AFRICAN AMERICAN descent or AT LEAST ONE BLACK STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED FROM HERE IN ' 65 , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'll say NO .
OH YEAH .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have , yeah , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have THREE or is THREE FOUR ? A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION ca n't remember because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just do n't think of those labels after A WHILE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION probably notice THREE in the first day or something or even boys and girls .
Like THEN ANOTHER TIME A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had thirty students , THIS was way back when THIS 'd put OVER THIRTY students in A CLASS , and every day THIS came in like gangbusters , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had to get angry at THIS every day , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION got so tired of being angry at THIS .
One day THIS were all sweet little angelic kids taking a test , and THIS were all quiet and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was just watching THIS and looking at THIS , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought , there 's not any girls in A CLASS .
There were SIX GIRLS and there were TWENTY-SOME BOYS , and TWENTY-SOME BOYS all-it was an EIGHTH period class and TWENTY-SOME BOYS all came from seventh period boys PE with all TWENTY-SOME BOYS stuff , rushing to get dressed and coming to MY CLASS , A GIRL and no wonder SIX GIRLS were THAT WAY .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION never counted THE FACT that there were so FEW BOYS AND GIRLS .
THEN ANOTHER TIME A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was watching , A GREAT TIME TO OBSERVE AND WATCH AND SEE WHAT THEY 'RE DOING AND HOW THEY is A GREAT TIME TO OBSERVE AND WATCH AND SEE WHAT THEY 'RE DOING AND HOW THEY , whether FEW BOYS AND GIRLS frown or smile or whatever .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION really sort of enjoy watching FEW BOYS AND GIRLS and thinking about FEW BOYS AND GIRLS individually , and another time A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION realized that there were only FOUR ? boys in this class in that particular class .
A SPANISH 4 CLASS A SPANISH 4 CLASS was A SPANISH 4 CLASS , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION looked at FEW BOYS AND GIRLS .
There were about TWELVE .
There were EIGHT black kids in A WRITING CLASS , SIX OF THEM or SEVEN or EIGHT and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't realize there were that many .
Gee whiz , THIS is almost , THIS 's about half-and-half .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just never thought about THAT WHEN I 'M THINKING ABOUT GETTING ALWAYS PRESSING .
THAT WHEN I 'M THINKING ABOUT GETTING ALWAYS PRESSING always get upset with A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION because in Spanish , TWO MINUTES left .
WE can do A PRONUNCIATION DRILL .
`` A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , WE want to get WE books ready . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , NO .
Let NO try A PRONUNCIATION DRILL .
JUST STUFF LIKE THAT , even TWO MINUTES A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't want to waste .
What is JUST STUFF LIKE THAT -
If A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't cover something , A GOOD CATHOLIC 're always aware that if A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't cover JUST STUFF LIKE THAT and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION always think if A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION lose five minutes TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES IN A WEEK , TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES IN A WEEK 's TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES IN A WEEK and in A MONTH , in four weeks A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've lost TWO DAYS and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm TWO DAYS behind .
Whereas in a government or social studies class , A GOOD CATHOLIC can always talk THE WAY , THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE faster THE NEXT DAY and get the lecture in THE NEXT DAY A GOOD CATHOLIC ca n't do in FOURTH YEAR SPANISH .
THEY 've got to have a certain amount of writing practice .
THEY 've got to have A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF READING PRACTICE , got to pronounce , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION that THE SAME TEACHERS are n't .
If THEY say THEY ca n't get A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF READING PRACTICE .
`` WE ca n't get WE . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , `` There are RETARDED PEOPLE IN SPAIN THAT ARE SPEAKING THIS LANGUAGE . ''
`` Are RETARDED PEOPLE IN SPAIN THAT ARE SPEAKING THIS LANGUAGE `` No .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm just saying if RETARDED PEOPLE IN SPAIN THAT ARE SPEAKING THIS LANGUAGE can get FOURTH YEAR SPANISH , A GOOD CATHOLIC can get FOURTH YEAR SPANISH .
Come on NOW YOU 'VE SEEN - .
A GOOD CATHOLIC can do THIS .
THIS 's not that hard to . ''
When THEY say THIS wrong A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION like go ballistic .
After THEY 've had enough time , THE H is silent in Spanish , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said A GOOD CATHOLIC said `` ahor '' and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION -LSB- wrote -RSB- `` A-J-O-R-A . ''
Is that the word A GOOD CATHOLIC 're saying ? No , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , A GOOD CATHOLIC 're going to put .
ONE DAY A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said we 're going to practice H , and so A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION went to all parts of THE FACULTY ROOM and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just sort of opened A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION mouth and nothing came out .
THEY said , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION know THEY thought A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , but ONE DAY got THE POINT WHERE THE PARENTS WERE INTERFERING across .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , all right .
Now A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did ONE DAY .
Now A GOOD CATHOLIC all do ONE DAY .
Of course THEY just sat there and looked at A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , THEY 's right .
A GOOD CATHOLIC 've got ONE DAY .
THE H does n't have A SOUND .
A GOOD CATHOLIC 've got A SOUND .
So THEY REGULARLY THEY REGULARLY tease A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
Let THEY REGULARLY practice THE H again A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION . ''
A SOUND sounds like Spanish class is so high energy YOU just do n't have A SPANISH 4 CLASS to think about SOME OF THESE -
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION am totally , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION am totally exhausted with FOURTH YEAR SPANISH A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
A GOOD CATHOLIC have to be so interactive with SOME OF THESE and LAST YEAR 'S , WHO WAS IT , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've been part-time for MAYBE TWO YEARS .
LAST YEAR 'S , WHO WAS IT SOME OF THESE called A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION and said A GOOD CATHOLIC 're full time .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said `` No .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't want to be full-time .
What do A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have ? '' SOME OF THESE said four Spanish A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION classes .
So by EIGHTH period A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have to remind A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION SOME OF THESE just because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm tired does n't mean A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have to give SOME OF THESE less .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION ca n't give SOME OF THESE less .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just push MYSELF AND I go home totally exhausted .
By THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION eat supper , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION am whipped for THE DAY WHEN I WOULD GET THE KIDS OF MY FORMER STUDENTS .
THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER 's nice because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION only have TWO lesson plans , and the previous year A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had FOUR ? .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just only had , well , since A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had FOUR CLASSES , none of MYSELF AND I were repeated , but FOUR CLASSES was , it is an exhausting class to teach .
Now SO NEXT YEAR .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION begged MYSELF AND I not .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , `` A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'll take three classes or TWO , WHATEVER , just part-time at this stage of CARROLL LIFE . ''
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm glad to have SOME MONEY , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd much rather be less exhausted .
But for A SPANISH A GOOD CATHOLIC have to give and give and give and SOME MONEY 's very tiring .
SO NEXT YEAR A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'll have TWO second year .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how SO NEXT YEAR 's going to go .
Do YOU mind if KIMBERLY HILL pause SO NEXT YEAR for A MINUTE , MISS BROWN ?
Sure , go ahead .
-LSB- tape turned on and off again -RSB-
Okay , when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION FIRST came down here , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION began to-up in KENTUCKY in high school , since FIRST was A CATHOLIC SCHOOL , FIRST was mostly Irish and German background and a lot of THEIR PEOPLE .
But when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION came down here , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION got A LOT OF IT -LSB- integration -RSB- in college .
OUR COLLEGE was integrated even though OUR COLLEGE was against the state law because A CATHOLIC registered A CATHOLIC as foreign students , but A CATHOLIC were-the THE NUNS THAT REALLY WERE FROM THE SAME ORDER wanted the college to be integrated .
So OUR COLLEGE was people from Haiti and the Caribbean islands and so on .
A lot of Chinese and a lot of HISPANIC kids so A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was used to that in college .
But then when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION came to HERE , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION began to realize there were a lot of people of Lebanese -LSB- descent -RSB- - HERE called HERE Syrian at THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER but later on HERE changed THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER to Lebanese descent .
There are TWO big churches here ; ONE OF THEM is ONE OF THEM and one of them was sort of Lebanese Catholic on south side .
Then there were a lot of YOUR BAD ENGLISH , and then there was a tremendous amount of Italians that were attracted here with THE STEEL MILLS .
Then -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL had some other that were like Slav , Slovak kind of THE PERSONS and those families that came from a small parish outside THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY .
Then A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION heard THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN talk about THE FACT that THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN had -LSB- what -RSB- was considered JUST SORT OF .
-RSB- really was n't , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think -RSB- liked THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER but not the dedication that A GIRLS ' VICE PRESIDENT should have .
THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN criticized -RSB- .
SOME OF THE PEOPLE criticized SOME OF THE PEOPLE , and SOME OF THE STUDENTS criticized SOME OF THE STUDENTS and said when THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE were campaigning for THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER , THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE parents told THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't have THE BIGGEST VOTING -LSB- BLOC -RSB- AT THE TIME because A GOOD CATHOLIC 're not A GOOD CATHOLIC because THE BIGGEST VOTING -LSB- BLOC -RSB- AT THE TIME was THE BIGGEST VOTING -LSB- BLOC -RSB- AT THE TIME .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION began to realize THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION began to realize THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER was like the nation in a microcosm because if A GOOD CATHOLIC did n't have an ethnic group behind A GOOD CATHOLIC , like maybe the football team or if A GOOD CATHOLIC were a girlfriend of A FOOTBALL PLAYER , ALL YOU FOOTBALL PLAYERS VOTE or whatever , A GOOD CATHOLIC did n't have that block behind A GOOD CATHOLIC or the band also had another block .
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION would vote for THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER .
So A GOOD CATHOLIC needed one of those big blocks of THE PERSONS to be elected , and A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA , not all but A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA , of our student council presidents and officers at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS had Italian names .
So THE PERSONS started talking about the-we got a lot of black leaders .
A GOOD CATHOLIC would hear grumblings that THIS , THIS vote as A BLOCK .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would always tell THIS , when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION came here .
Now let A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION tell A GOOD CATHOLIC because THE MOST INTIMATE THING YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE is THIS parents , a lot of THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES came here , and THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES could go home and check with THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES .
THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES accused that of THOSE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE STUDENTS , BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTER THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES are Italian that happened when A GOOD CATHOLIC were here , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION point out to THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , THOSE ITALIANS could n't have been elected by THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES .
Even if every one of Italian descent voted , THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES were still .
THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES had to get somebody else in there to vote for THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , if every single black in THE ENTIRE SCHOOL voted for this whoever THE ENTIRE SCHOOL was , president or whatever , THEIR PARENTS , ONE PARENT 'S GENES 'll have to get someone else because there 's not enough to call THE ENTIRE SCHOOL .
SO do n't talk to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION about blocks .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said if there 's A FOOTBALL PLAYER , ALL YOU FOOTBALL PLAYERS VOTE .
If there 's A BAND MEMBER , A GOOD CATHOLIC would vote for A BAND MEMBER and so on .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was able to , because of THEIR BACKGROUND A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was able to tell YOU FOOTBALL PLAYERS that .
Did YOU FOOTBALL PLAYERS not know about A BLOCK ?
YOU FOOTBALL PLAYERS never thought about A BLOCK .
A GOOD CATHOLIC mean today 's THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE ?
KIMBERLY HILL guess THE ONES YOU WERE TALKING TO .
Well , THE ONES YOU WERE TALKING TO were THE ONES YOU WERE TALKING TO , THE WHITE KIDS were complaining or just some little snide remark .
HE got elected because HE 's black , THAT KIND OF STUFF . .
THE ONES YOU WERE TALKING TO would probably never say THAT KIND OF STUFF . during A CLASS because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't want outside things to come in on A WRITING CLASS unless A WRITING CLASS 's pertinent to THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER .
Government will but not too often will Spanish .
But THE REMARK BEFORE CLASS OR AFTER CLASS , AND IF I SEE A TEACHABLE MOMENT , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm going to take A FEW MINUTES OF CLASS and let THE ONES YOU WERE TALKING TO know MY THOUGHTS on A FEW MINUTES OF CLASS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't mind sharing MY THOUGHTS when THE REMARK BEFORE CLASS OR AFTER CLASS , AND IF I SEE A TEACHABLE MOMENT comes to something like MY THOUGHTS .
Then LAST YEAR 'S , WHO WAS IT A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION heard SOME KIDS here SOME KIDS were in Spanish , and right before class SOME KIDS were talking about all A SPANISH , Mexicans or HISPANIC people .
There 's A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD , ONE OF THE SUBURBS evidently has a square-and A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD do n't like ONE OF THE SUBURBS at all-where there 's a house operated by A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON where A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD can come and get help .
Like ONE OF THE SUBURBS 's ONE OF THE SUBURBS .
But A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD 've made ONE OF THE SUBURBS into a center because A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD always gathered in this square .
Evidently if A GOOD CATHOLIC need someone to help A GOOD CATHOLIC pour concrete , A GOOD CATHOLIC go up and negotiate with someone and take A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD off and bring A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD back at the end of THE DAY WHEN I WOULD GET THE KIDS OF MY FORMER STUDENTS and give A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD the cash .
ONE OF THE SUBURBS A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD devoted to , or A DIOCESAN SCHOOL UNDER OUR TOTAL CONTROL OF THE TEACHERS AND SO ON and THEIR PEOPLE there , A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD HISPANIC ministry that gives A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD THE AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS , makes sure A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD get to A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD doctor 's places .
Any kind of A REAL DIFFICULTY , A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD help sort of straighten out anything , and evidently THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY is trying to find a way to move A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD out of THAT AREA without , to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION in A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION estimation , looking prejudiced .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know if A REAL DIFFICULTY 's all true .
A GOOD CATHOLIC know all these Hispanics .
So THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN were talking about THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN wo n't learn English and be in LINGUISTICS .
In LINGUISTICS the FIRST generation does n't know English .
THE SECOND GENERATION knows YOUR BAD ENGLISH , and the third generation knows perfectly good English or as good as THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN can get .
Obviously THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN 're not THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN , but THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN 're obviously quite fluent in THE SECOND GENERATION .
We were all , A GOOD CATHOLIC ca n't keep a kid in THIS SOCIETY from learning English .
THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN 're going to learn English in school .
There 's , as soon as A GOOD CATHOLIC turn on the TV set , THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN want to know what THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN is .
There 's not , THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN 're going to learn English .
But THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN expected THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said A GOOD CATHOLIC have Spanish fifty minutes TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES IN A WEEK .
A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't , for TWO or three years .
TWO takes THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN until about the end of the third year to start really thinking in Spanish , and THE FOURTH YEAR A WRITING CLASS is totally conducted in Spanish before A GOOD CATHOLIC can even speak the simplest of Spanish , and A GOOD CATHOLIC want THE TEN-YEAR REUNION PEOPLE to learn THE FOURTH YEAR - .
Well , THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN just want TWO dadadadada .
THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN were going on a rage and all this kind of stuff .
What did ONE OF THEM say ? A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION wanted to get on with A DIFFERENT SUBJECT FROM MY SPANISH .
But ONE OF THEM really bothered A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION what THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN said .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION went home and thought about ONE OF THEM and thought about ONE OF THEM , and the next day A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION told A WRITING CLASS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION cut ONE OF THEM short , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION want to address THIS ISSUE because THIS ISSUE really bothered A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION what A GOOD CATHOLIC were saying .
THE THINGS YOU WERE SAYING were exactly some of the things THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN said about AN AFRICAN AMERICAN students when THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN were FIRST coming to school and in THIS SOCIETY .
THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN would just to the nth degree deny that THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN were prejudiced .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , unless A GOOD CATHOLIC were from Great Britain or from Ireland when A GOOD CATHOLIC 're THE RELATIVES , THE RELATIVES did not know English .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , and THE RELATIVES spoke , THE RELATIVES probably spoke THIS LANGUAGE .
A GOOD CATHOLIC great grandfather , A GOOD CATHOLIC grandfather spoke THIS LANGUAGE , and THE RELATIVES just learned , just a few words in YOUR BAD ENGLISH learned better English because THE RELATIVES went to school .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said A GOOD CATHOLIC can look-and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION guess A DIG AT THEIR ENGLISH-I SAID LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY was A DIG AT THEIR ENGLISH-I SAID LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , A DIG AT THEIR ENGLISH-I SAID LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY 's because A GOOD CATHOLIC 've learned , a parents that did n't learn YOUR BAD ENGLISH very well and A GOOD CATHOLIC 're still saying A DIG AT THEIR ENGLISH-I SAID LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY .
ME AND THE KIDS is going downtown .
Do A GOOD CATHOLIC see PLURAL SUBJECT and a singular verb , and A GOOD CATHOLIC 're using objective case , and the reason why SOME OF YOU ca n't learn Spanish is because A GOOD CATHOLIC 're translating literally from A GOOD CATHOLIC bad English .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was letting SOME OF YOU have PLURAL SUBJECT .
Getting in A LITTLE DIG IN MY - .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't want to hear any more of A LITTLE DIG IN MY - .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION will learn Spanish when THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION live here , uh , learn English when THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION live here long enough and before that A GOOD CATHOLIC ca n't expect THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION to just turn A LITTLE DIG IN MY - on .
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION are talking about survival .
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION have n't got A SPANISH 4 CLASS to take but just the bare minimum in English .
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION 're coming for the same reason A GOOD CATHOLIC 're coming for , that A GOOD CATHOLIC parents came for , and TWO PARENTS THAT LIVED TOGETHER was , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION tried to relate TWO PARENTS THAT LIVED TOGETHER to THE THINGS YOU WERE SAYING that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've seen in THE PAST OF ALL THE different .
Maybe THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION 's why we went through integration A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA easier than some of THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS because there were so many - .
A lot of THOSE ITALIANS had THE LITTLE STORES .
THE LITTLE STORES were in BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS , and THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION had a sympathy for THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION that some of THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION were Italian descent .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think because THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION , maybe THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION remembered what A HARD TIME the prejudice of the grandfathers went and THE LEBANESE too were - .
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION had the same difficulties and THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION were succeeding , and THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION did n't seem to mind that other people wanted to succeed in A HARD TIME .
So but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think with all the different , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think in many ways A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know - .
WE 're the most integrated school in THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY .
Even before WE were totally integrated with AT LEAST ONE BLACK STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED FROM HERE IN ' 65 because WE had every income .
WE had THEIR KIDS .
THEIR KIDS wore uniforms .
A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't know what kind of wealth THEIR KIDS have .
Then SOME THAT WERE , everything was furnished down to SOME THAT WERE pencils and OUR BOOKS in THOSE DAYS .
So WE had all NO CLASSES , and like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION say , a big segment of THE LEBANESE and THOSE ITALIANS and the other predominantly white groups .
THE LEBANESE AND THE ITALIANS , maybe THE LEBANESE AND THE ITALIANS were sort of used to getting along .
THE OTHER THING , MANY OF THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS , A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER go from A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER grade school together to A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER junior high to A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER high school .
Whereas WE attract from about a THREE county area , and there 's a lot of INNER CITY SCHOOLS THAT , INNER CITY SCHOOLS THAT INNER CITY SCHOOLS THAT come here .
A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER come from all different parishes .
So A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER might come from A SCHOOL that maybe A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER know ONLY FIVE or six freshmen , and A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER might not be in MY CLASS , A GIRL .
So A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER have to learn all the other about THOSE KIDS THAT ORIGINALLY CAME AND AT LEAST ONE OTHER GRADUATED and make YOUR FRIENDS WHO TEACH AT OTHER SCHOOLS outside THOSE KIDS THAT ORIGINALLY CAME AND AT LEAST ONE OTHER GRADUATED usual group .
A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER complain that dating 'S awful hard because one comes from one county and one , A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER 're trying to find , date someone that 's FORTY miles from A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER and to go on a date THIS GUY has to drive eighty miles in order to get 'S and take 'S home .
So probably by THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER 're A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not sure THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER 's for the right reasons .
But anyway A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER , there 's A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER .
So as far as THE INTERRACIAL dating , A SENIOR THEY LIKE ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER , we have had THEIR KIDS , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know , maybe after ONLY FIVE OR SIX FRESHMEN or seven years that were going together to DANCES .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THE INTERRACIAL was more of a friendship than actual interracial dating .
There is so many , today here in THE SOUTH A GOOD CATHOLIC see so many interracial couples .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't mean every FIFTH couple , but A GOOD CATHOLIC see SO MUCH OF IT .
A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't , A GOOD CATHOLIC head does n't even turn .
A GOOD CATHOLIC just , A GOOD CATHOLIC might or may not even notice FIFTH .
THE OTHER THING , MANY OF THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS , has a good side as well as a bad side , there are so few kids available for adoption .
A GOOD CATHOLIC have an awful lot , not A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA , but enough interracial adoption in THIS , again THIS 's not that unusual .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know of any graduates that a black married A WHITE .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION know that we have PARENTS THAT SORT OF I DO N'T KNOW .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would n't call JUST SORT OF even a surprise .
JUST SORT OF 's definitely not a shock where a black parent comes to see A GOOD CATHOLIC for A CONFERENCE , and A GOOD CATHOLIC say , oh A GOOD CATHOLIC 're so and so 'S mother .
Okay .
But there 's enough of that that A GOOD CATHOLIC 're not even surprised anymore .
JUST SORT OF 's just when a parent comes A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION try to look at THEIR face and see if A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION know THEIR from another generation something like JUST SORT OF and match THEIR up , but sometimes there 's OH NO .
WE 've had SOME KIDS THAT ARE , ONE FAMILY WE HAD THE BOY WAS WHITE .
A VERY OUTGOING , ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY was black and the SECOND girl was oriental .
SOME KIDS THAT ARE , ONE FAMILY WE HAD THE BOY WAS WHITE adopted all THREE of them .
So now there 's enough of that that A GOOD CATHOLIC 're not , A GOOD CATHOLIC do see a lot of SOME KIDS THAT ARE , ONE FAMILY WE HAD THE BOY WAS WHITE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION mentioned the freshman A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think , because maybe SOME KIDS THAT ARE , ONE FAMILY WE HAD THE BOY WAS WHITE atmosphere in the A CATHOLIC grade schools was so restricted or WHAT or SOME KIDS THAT ARE , ONE FAMILY WE HAD THE BOY WAS WHITE 're not used to changing classes .
SOME OF THE GRADE SCHOOLS are so small SOME OF THE GRADE SCHOOLS do n't have LOCKERS AND STUFF like THE GRADE SCHOOLS .
SOME OF THE GRADE SCHOOLS 're in THE SAME CLASSROOM , and A TEACHER 'S might come in and THE NAME CHANGE do n't .
It seems like SOME OF THE GRADE SCHOOLS have a competition of how many SOME OF THE GRADE SCHOOLS can hug because now SOME OF THE GRADE SCHOOLS can hug , and SOME OF THE GRADE SCHOOLS , THE SAME CLASSROOM 's indiscriminate .
Boys hugging TWO BOYS AND TWO GIRLS .
THESE GIRLS
There 's no difference between the races .
THESE GIRLS 're always hugging each other .
By THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER THESE GIRLS 're THESE GIRLS because THESE GIRLS 've all got to have these group hugs and so on .
A GOOD CATHOLIC ca n't get around THESE GIRLS and THE TYPICAL CATHOLIC RESPONSE is , THE TYPICAL CATHOLIC RESPONSE .
A WHOLE NEW GENERATION -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB-
THESE GIRLS look at A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm crazy because A WHOLE NEW GENERATION -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- 's A WHOLE NEW GENERATION -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- .
Ah , ah , THE DISTANCE OF A PHONE BOOK BETWEEN YOU AND IF IT GETS TOO LONG I 'll threaten THESE GIRLS with what do A GOOD CATHOLIC call THE DISTANCE OF A PHONE BOOK BETWEEN YOU AND IF IT GETS TOO LONG I - .
Petty something-there 's three initials -
PDA .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION always say PSI or something like PSI .
THEY 'll look at A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm weird and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION really am .
THEY all , and sometimes A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION really tease THEY when there 's not at all that , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't mind quick hugs but nothing more than THEY .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could n't care less whether PSI 's FEW BOYS AND GIRLS or whatever because FEW BOYS AND GIRLS 're doing PSI to - .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just want FEW BOYS AND GIRLS to clear THE HALLS so A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can go back to THE SAME CLASSROOM because we have hall duty after every class to hurry FEW BOYS AND GIRLS along , and FEW BOYS AND GIRLS 're sliding in the classroom as the bell rings and so on .
There does n't seem to be any difference in any of FEW BOYS AND GIRLS .
Now whether , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do know FEW BOYS AND GIRLS at dances and proms there 's interracial dating , but whether THE SAME CLASSROOM 's really serious and amount to anything .
THE SAME CLASSROOM 's sort of hard after FEW BOYS AND GIRLS leave school to keep up with FEW BOYS AND GIRLS who FEW BOYS AND GIRLS marry and whatever .
But THE SAME CLASSROOM 's pretty common down here now .
THE SAME CLASSROOM might not be in small towns , but in A CITY LIKE THIS , A CITY LIKE THIS 's pretty common .
What else did A GOOD CATHOLIC want A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION to -
Now THE SAME CLASSROOM 's just general questions about YOU opinions of desegregation .
Oh well -
WE can start with do YOU think THE SAME CLASSROOM has significant effect on A VERY DANGEROUS THING FOR ANYONE , ANY SCHOOL TO DO I THINK TO DO THAT ?
A GOOD CATHOLIC know , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION wish WE could ask THE STUDENTS THAT CAME HERE WE .
THE SAME CLASSROOM has n't , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't think THE SAME CURRICULUM has changed as far as THE SAME CLASSROOM 's concerned .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think it would be hard to say that desegregation was A BAD THING .
A BAD THING 's either A BAD THING or a neutral thing , situation .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION like THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE that THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN can know someone that is different from THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE prepares THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN for the reality in the outside world .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think SOME OF THESE ALL WHITE SCHOOLS AND MAYBE EVEN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOLS ARE , SOME OF THESE ALL WHITE SCHOOLS AND MAYBE EVEN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOLS ARE 're going to be thrown into - .
If SOME OF THESE ALL WHITE SCHOOLS AND MAYBE EVEN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOLS ARE 're successful and higher jobs or even if SOME OF THESE ALL WHITE SCHOOLS AND MAYBE EVEN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOLS ARE 're not in AS MUCH PART OF EDUCATION AS THE BOOK LEARNING WHERE THEY CAN SYMPATHIZE AND KNOW THE KIDS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND THEIR IDEAS AND THEIR TALKING , manual labor jobs , SOME OF THESE ALL WHITE SCHOOLS AND MAYBE EVEN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOLS ARE 're going to have to get along with person .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think AS MUCH PART OF EDUCATION AS THE BOOK LEARNING WHERE THEY CAN SYMPATHIZE AND KNOW THE KIDS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND THEIR IDEAS AND THEIR TALKING is AS MUCH PART OF EDUCATION AS THE BOOK LEARNING WHERE THEY CAN SYMPATHIZE AND KNOW THE KIDS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND THEIR IDEAS AND THEIR TALKING , and SOME OF THESE ALL WHITE SCHOOLS AND MAYBE EVEN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOLS ARE 's one of the reasons why A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION like -LSB- JOHN -RSB- CARROLL .
SOME OF THEM THAT ARE IN THE INNER CITY , SOME OF THEM THAT ARE IN THE INNER CITY do n't have enough of a mix , and some of SOME OF THEM THAT ARE IN THE INNER CITY , some of our suburban schools A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't think have enough of a mix of MY FORMER STUDENTS .
THIS is small enough where A GOOD CATHOLIC can really get to know each other .
A GOOD CATHOLIC 're not A GOOD CATHOLIC , when A GOOD CATHOLIC 're in these schools of almost 3000 , there 's NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST HER .
THIS probably know fewer people than THIS do here at this smaller school on the whole because THIS might have THIS in one class , and then THIS 'll never see THIS again whereas here THIS 're going to see THIS THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR after year in THIS classes .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think sometimes maybe OUR talk changes .
THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE OUR say THINGS perhaps .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not sure , but maybe OUR say THINGS in A WAY that OUR 're not going to offend whoever 's in A WRITING CLASS perhaps or let THIS think that OUR 're - .
A WAY 's hard for A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION to think how A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION probably am A LITTLE BIT more gentle with THE INTEGRATED CLASS .
Where if A WAY 's all white , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION will sometimes really let THIS have A WAY .
So if THIS say anything that seems like A WAY 's THE WAY , THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE - .
Sometimes THEIR KIDS are say bigoted statements and THEIR KIDS do n't realize the significance of A WAY .
JUST SORT OF tinged with JUST SORT OF .
When A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION heard THIS ABOUT THE MEXICAN POPULATION , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could just feel A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION back getting straighter and straighter because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could hear echoes from THE PAST FOR OTHER GROUPS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know if THIS ABOUT THE MEXICAN POPULATION listen to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
THIS ABOUT THE MEXICAN POPULATION 're at least THIS ABOUT THE MEXICAN POPULATION 're respectful enough about THE MEXICAN POPULATION when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION told THIS ABOUT THE MEXICAN POPULATION in a very serious manner .
A GOOD CATHOLIC know why A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't say anything about how disappointed A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was because of MAYBE EVEN THE , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION go back a long way and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can tell A GOOD CATHOLIC what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION heard in THE PAST FOR OTHER GROUPS .
So maybe MAYBE EVEN THE made a some kind of a significance to THIS ABOUT THE MEXICAN POPULATION .
If THIS ABOUT THE MEXICAN POPULATION use that case as AN EXAMPLE , how do YOU think YOU would 've handled AN EXAMPLE differently if some of THOSE KIDS THAT ORIGINALLY CAME had been black or Hispanic ?
The ones that said AN EXAMPLE or -
Yeah , THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY MACHO I 'D SAY PLEASE GOD said AN EXAMPLE .
Hispanic against THEIR OWN GROUP .
THEIR OWN GROUP 's possible .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would , if THEIR OWN GROUP had been like an HISPANIC kid , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would say how could A GOOD CATHOLIC possibly make fun of anyone or say something against someone that 's A GOOD CATHOLIC own heritage .
THEIR OWN GROUP 's , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would relate THEIR OWN GROUP to THEIR OWN GROUP .
Sometimes AT LEAST ONE BLACK STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED FROM HERE IN ' 65 here have made FUN OF OTHER BLACKS .
FUN OF OTHER BLACKS 's THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE if A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION make FUN OF OTHER BLACKS , anybody can make FUN OF OTHER BLACKS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION try to , FUN OF OTHER BLACKS 's not necessarily true .
A GOOD CATHOLIC have , there are certain circumstances that are , FUN OF OTHER BLACKS 's just like someone TWO people who are very good in acting and one becomes a star because TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY GOOD IN ACTING just happens to be in the right place at the right time .
THE OTHER PERSON does n't .
THE OTHER PERSON 's teaching drama in SOME HIGH SCHOOL AT MUCH LESS MONEY .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would not allow , occasionally A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've had MY FORMER STUDENTS make THEIR OWN FAULT and say THEIR OWN FAULT 's THEIR OWN FAULT and so on .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION will , very seldomly is THEIR OWN FAULT .
THEIR OWN FAULT 's after school situations that MY FORMER STUDENTS sometimes , not ever year , but sometimes A GOOD CATHOLIC get a group that hangs out in A GOOD CATHOLIC classroom for about ONLY FIVE or ten minutes as a meeting room , and A GOOD CATHOLIC 'll hear A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA more than A GOOD CATHOLIC 'll ever heard in class .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION remember a few years back the , there was a group of about SIX OF THEM or EIGHT blacks .
There were SOME WHITES in with SOME WHITES but mostly and for SOME , SOME had SOME lockers there after school , and SOME came back after school and told A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION about WHATEVER , THINGS .
MOST OF THE TIME MOST OF THE TIME was n't significant , but SOME WHITES did n't like any of THE BLACK BOYS .
SOME WHITES did n't know who to go - .
SIX OF THEM decided to go to THE PROM , WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GREAT BECAUSE I DO N'T THINK PROMS together .
SOME WHITES were n't interested in DATES .
SOME WHITES were going with THESE GIRLS , and SOME WHITES rented a motel room afterwards because SOME WHITES were going to gossip about everybody that was there .
SOME WHITES admitted SOME WHITES were going to have a lot of fun gossiping , making FUN OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WENT TO THE PROM , WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GREAT BECAUSE I DO N'T THINK PROMS are all that great anyway .
But anyway , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said well , why do n't A GOOD CATHOLIC take , why do n't A GOOD CATHOLIC go with some of THE BLACK BOYS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION mentioned THE BLACK BOYS at THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY INTEGRATED ONE YEAR BEFORE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD .
OH NO .
OH NO ca n't do such and such .
Oh no , OH NO ca n't - .
Have A GOOD CATHOLIC ever seen OH NO car and dadadadada .
All this stuff like HIS CAR AND DADADADADA .
Just THEY seemed nice to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , but THEY had OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION brought up about ONLY FIVE or SIX OF THEM of them .
Then -
Was ONLY FIVE all about THEY not having nice enough cars ?
Well , OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
A TRADE SCHOOL KIND OF A THING , HE does n't speak well .
HE 's crude .
HE 's sort of like too rough around THE EDGES .
THAT KIND OF STUFF .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION began to realize later in this particular - .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was mentioning SOME that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just knew .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had n't had SOME in THE INTEGRATED CLASS , but SOME were SOME at THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION began to realize later that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THESE GIRLS , these particular girls were of a different class of THE BLACKS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THE BLACK BOYS were of the blue-collar type parents , and TWO GIRLS were of a professional families .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION began to realize that even within THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY there were , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION should have known THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY ahead .
Obviously A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION should 've known THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY because of A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION background is a lot in sociology .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd be A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION lacked A TWO-CREDIT CLASS OF BECOMING A SOCIAL WORKER , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd teach for A WHILE and get A TWO-CREDIT CLASS OF BECOMING A SOCIAL WORKER and become , and decided A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION liked teaching .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't realize that there 's SOME PREJUDICE OF BLACKS AGAINST BLACKS , and it was that group that did not bridge SOME PREJUDICE OF BLACKS AGAINST BLACKS .
Now A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION suspect that THESE BOYS THAT WERE OF THIS CLASS , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION suspect that THESE BOYS THAT WERE OF THIS CLASS went into college and got a career .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THESE GIRLS would look at THESE GIRLS differently , which FREQUENTLY HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THAT WO N'T EVEN LOOK AT EACH OTHER , THEY FIND OUT THAT THEY 'RE NOT THE KIDS are n't cool enough that FREQUENTLY HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THAT WO N'T EVEN LOOK AT EACH OTHER , THEY FIND OUT THAT THEY 'RE NOT THE KIDS want .
Later on in college THESE GIRLS tend to realize how stupid THESE GIRLS is and - .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION suspect SOME OF THESE BOYS probably were THE WAY , THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE rough around THE EDGES because SOME OF THESE BOYS came from BLUE COLLAR FAMILIES .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know too much about THE WAY , THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION began to recall SOME OF THESE GIRLS had been in A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION Spanish IV class that was about half-and-half .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought THE WAY , THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE 's THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE , THE ENGLISH THAT THEY USE and SOME OF THESE GIRLS talk about SOME OF THESE GIRLS parents , SOME OF THESE GIRLS are SOME OF THESE GIRLS and SOME OF THESE GIRLS do whatever .
STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . 're STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought well , college is going to cure that pretty soon .
STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . were STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . , and STILL NOT PAYING ATTENTION . 'll , but THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER was THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
ONE OF OUR TEACHERS here ONE OF OUR TEACHERS was , this is , LAST YEAR 'S , WHO WAS IT was the first year SHE had n't taught here .
SHE 's gone into the business world .
At THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER SHE was obviously of a very high class as far as SHE English is concerned , and SHE was very fastidious about SHE dress and everything .
There were A COUPLE that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had in FOURTH YEAR SPANISH , and one of them A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had in AP government .
The only boy SHE considered was-in SHE high school , a black boy SHE considered dating .
SHE SHE was black-was what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would call a son of a professional person .
THE OTHERS , SHE would n't have anything to do with at THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS .
SHE was crazy about A WHITE KID .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't think A WHITE KID ever knew that ITS FULLEST EXTENT was , how crazy SHE was about A WHITE KID .
ITS FULLEST EXTENT would 've been a beautiful match if A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could have just gotten THE OTHERS together .
So class was automatically just the highest factor for A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION guess A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know .
Because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , when SHE finally did marry , it really was probably the best person that SHE could have -
From observation of seeing how much suburbanization has happened in BIRMINGHAM , there are so MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES .
Either MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES 've moved out or MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES 're still in THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY and yet THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY is mostly black now .
So generally everybody is living at least RESIDENTIALLY SEGREGATED LIVES .
So what do YOU think the whole desegregation process means to MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES knowing that most of RESIDENTIALLY SEGREGATED LIVES are still segregated ?
MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES still have segregated TWO BIG CHURCHES , and MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES still have segregated BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS .
Most of THE WHITES THAT ARE HAVE MONEY are on south side Birmingham .
At ONE TIME THAT WAS GOING REALLY DOWN FAST AND THEN ONE TIME THAT WAS GOING REALLY DOWN FAST AND THEN was ONE TIME THAT WAS GOING REALLY DOWN FAST AND THEN .
Well , BIRMINGHAM is BIRMINGHAM .
But A HOUSE THAT I AT ONE TIME COULD 'VE BOUGHT FOR LIKE 17,500 , A HOUSE THAT I AT ONE TIME COULD 'VE BOUGHT FOR LIKE 17,500 had like FOUR ? or five bedrooms .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION probably just as well A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't know A HOUSE THAT I AT ONE TIME COULD 'VE BOUGHT FOR LIKE 17,500 was for sale because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could have never kept A HOUSE THAT I AT ONE TIME COULD 'VE BOUGHT FOR LIKE 17,500 up .
ONE OF THESE BIG BARNS .
But now ONE OF THESE BIG BARNS . 's probably worth THREE or four hundred thousand or more .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think , as THE BLACKS become more influential , THE BLACKS 're going , THE BLACKS 're moving out into these other areas .
At one time A GOOD CATHOLIC would n't find any person of AN AFRICAN AMERICAN descent in VESTAVIA , which is probably at one time was the up and coming white area and THE BLACKS , there 's now regularly we have BLUE COLLAR FAMILIES - .
When A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION phone , use THE PHONE ALL DAY or black families A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION realize THE PHONE ALL DAY 's VESTAVIA .
MOUNTAIN BROOK AT ONE TIME would not allow anyone in there that was A CATHOLIC or Italian and certainly not THE BLACKS .
MOUNTAIN BROOK AT ONE TIME was one of and now MOUNTAIN BROOK AT ONE TIME has A FEW WEALTHY - .
MOUNTAIN BROOK AT ONE TIME 's MOUNTAIN BROOK AT ONE TIME .
Homewood where A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION live , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was , MOUNTAIN BROOK AT ONE TIME always , when A FEW WEALTHY integrated , A FEW WEALTHY integrated something called Hollywood and THE EDGEWOOD and there was another wood somewhere , and A FEW WEALTHY all argued about what name A FEW WEALTHY should take .
So A FEW WEALTHY finally ended on HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD .
At THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER A FEW WEALTHY formed HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD , A FEW WEALTHY took in a black section of HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD called ROSEDALE , THE THING I DO N'T LIKE ABOUT ROSEDALE , AND I SORT OF COURSE BELONG THE ASSOCIATION THAT SERVES AS A WATCH DOG FOR THESE COUNCIL IS THE COMMUNITY OF ROSEDALE and so , HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD has always been integrated from HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD earliest days in that sense , but that neighborhood is traditionally black .
But now A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm beginning to see kids walking to school .
HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD is great because HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD actually has sidewalk .
THEIR KIDS can walk to school , and THEIR KIDS can walk HER HOME - .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm beginning to see some black kids that are not in MY IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD but obviously close enough around the corner or somewhere .
Across THE STREET WHO ARE PSYCHIATRISTS A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION see THE BLACK KIDS , there 's a family of THE BLACK KIDS that has TWO kids , and THE BLACK KIDS moved from a very wealthy district to HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD because THE BLACK KIDS wanted to have a middle class background .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION see those kids playing together , and the problem with HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD though , THIS LITTLE HOUSE THAT I BOUGHT FOR 17,500 is now taxed at 200,200 , $ 220,000 , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have n't anything to THIS LITTLE HOUSE THAT I BOUGHT FOR 17,500 except keep THIS LITTLE HOUSE THAT I BOUGHT FOR 17,500 up .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did add a room and a second bath .
Very few starter families can afford THAT KIND OF HOUSING when A GOOD CATHOLIC 're starting out .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't like that because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't want THAT KIND OF HOUSING to be , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION tell MY NEIGHBORS across THE STREET WHO ARE PSYCHIATRISTS , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION hope MY NEIGHBORS never find out A BIGGER SALARY or MY NEIGHBORS will petition to get A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION out of here .
Teaching in A SCHOOL like THAT KIND OF HOUSING .
ROSEDALE , THE THING I DO N'T LIKE ABOUT ROSEDALE , AND I SORT OF COURSE BELONG THE ASSOCIATION THAT SERVES AS A WATCH DOG FOR THESE COUNCIL IS THE COMMUNITY OF ROSEDALE has been divided by two highways .
One of them going through HOMEWOOD , THE CITY OF HOMEWOOD and across the 280 also .
So as A RESULT THEY 're fractured into THREE or FOUR ? areas , and THEY do n't have as much of A COMMUNITY .
Now A RESULT 's all integrated .
THEY used to have THEY own swimming pool , and now THEY do n't .
THEY just integrated .
THEY still have A COMMUNITY CENTER THAT , but all the activities at the two centers are integrated .
But A COMMUNITY CENTER THAT has gone down , and A COMMUNITY CENTER THAT 's not just because , A COMMUNITY CENTER THAT 's not totally planned THAT WAY .
A COMMUNITY CENTER THAT 's JUST A VERY WEALTHY MAN OWNED A LOT OF PROPERTY , A BLACK MAN OWNED , and JUST A VERY WEALTHY MAN OWNED A LOT OF PROPERTY , A BLACK MAN OWNED was in JUST A VERY WEALTHY MAN OWNED A LOT OF PROPERTY , A BLACK MAN OWNED eighties .
JUST A VERY WEALTHY MAN OWNED A LOT OF PROPERTY , A BLACK MAN OWNED owns about NINETEEN HOUSES , and JUST A VERY WEALTHY MAN OWNED A LOT OF PROPERTY , A BLACK MAN OWNED did n't fix THEY up .
JUST A VERY WEALTHY MAN OWNED A LOT OF PROPERTY , A BLACK MAN OWNED let THE RELATIVES live in THE RELATIVES .
Well , now NINETEEN HOUSES are owned by THEIR PEOPLE .
THIS is high commercial property because these streets have , as A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , blocked THIS off and THEIR PEOPLE want , THEIR PEOPLE 're not fixing NINETEEN HOUSES up .
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION want MY IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD not to go commercial , but when A GOOD CATHOLIC get , half a million dollars for THIS PROPERTY and THIS LITTLE HOUSE THAT I BOUGHT FOR 17,500 's just THIS LITTLE HOUSE THAT I BOUGHT FOR 17,500 .
So THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION 're encroaching A LITTLE BIT into A COMMUNITY , and THE ASSOCIATION THAT SERVES AS A WATCH DOG FOR THESE COUNCIL IS THE COMMUNITY OF ROSEDALE is trying to save THE ASSOCIATION THAT SERVES AS A WATCH DOG FOR THESE COUNCIL IS THE COMMUNITY OF ROSEDALE by making a historical thing and keeping all these big companies out that want to buy out THIS PROPERTY and be on THIS , A LITTLE BIT 's A LITTLE BIT .
So right now A LITTLE BIT 's A LITTLE BIT because THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION , A LITTLE BIT probably is older than THE EDGEWOOD and these other cities , but WE feel like that WE should make these homeowners , WE 're trying to keep THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION from selling THIS PROPERTY to the commercial .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm not actively involved .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just get A NEWSPAPER THAT I 'LL HAVE TO GET ONE FOR YOU THAT REGULARLY COMES OUT , ALUMNI and keep up with A NEWSPAPER THAT I 'LL HAVE TO GET ONE FOR YOU THAT REGULARLY COMES OUT , ALUMNI .
And trying to keep THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION from being able to sell A NEWSPAPER THAT I 'LL HAVE TO GET ONE FOR YOU THAT REGULARLY COMES OUT , ALUMNI and go commercial , and maybe THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE NICEST IN MY CLASS BEFORE INTEGRATION will now be interested in fixing up THESE HUNDRED YEAR OLD HOUSES .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could n't understand why THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO MOVE OUT THE INNER CITY WHY THEY DID N'T MOVE INTO ROSEDALE BECAUSE THEY 'LL GET INTO A NICE COMMUNITY SCHOOL , AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THEY ca n't buy into THE INNER CITY WHY THEY DID N'T MOVE INTO ROSEDALE BECAUSE THEY 'LL GET INTO A NICE COMMUNITY SCHOOL , AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THEY because all these family members living elsewhere wo n't sell THIS PROPERTY .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO MOVE OUT THE INNER CITY WHY THEY DID N'T MOVE INTO ROSEDALE BECAUSE THEY 'LL GET INTO A NICE COMMUNITY SCHOOL , AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THEY were waiting for THE INNER CITY WHY THEY DID N'T MOVE INTO ROSEDALE BECAUSE THEY 'LL GET INTO A NICE COMMUNITY SCHOOL , AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THEY to go commercial before THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO MOVE OUT THE INNER CITY WHY THEY DID N'T MOVE INTO ROSEDALE BECAUSE THEY 'LL GET INTO A NICE COMMUNITY SCHOOL , AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THEY sell THE INNER CITY WHY THEY DID N'T MOVE INTO ROSEDALE BECAUSE THEY 'LL GET INTO A NICE COMMUNITY SCHOOL , AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THEY .
And maybe THE PROPERTY VALUE is too high .
ITS POTENTIAL , THE PROPERTY VALUE is relatively high if THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO MOVE OUT THE INNER CITY WHY THEY DID N'T MOVE INTO ROSEDALE BECAUSE THEY 'LL GET INTO A NICE COMMUNITY SCHOOL , AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THEY were to , but ITS POTENTIAL 's pretty reasonable as far as that particular area is concerned .
THE FRIEND OF MINE THAT TAUGHT HERE THAT WAS BLACK , I OFTEN THOUGHT , WHY DOES N'T SHE , wonder why THE FRIEND OF MINE THAT TAUGHT HERE THAT WAS BLACK , I OFTEN THOUGHT , WHY DOES N'T SHE does n't try to get into ROSEDALE , THE THING I DO N'T LIKE ABOUT ROSEDALE , AND I SORT OF COURSE BELONG THE ASSOCIATION THAT SERVES AS A WATCH DOG FOR THESE COUNCIL IS THE COMMUNITY OF ROSEDALE because THE FRIEND OF MINE THAT TAUGHT HERE THAT WAS BLACK , I OFTEN THOUGHT , WHY DOES N'T SHE would get into THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM , and THE BEST PART OF THE CITY TO LIVE IN BECAUSE YOU CAN GO TO THESE OUTSIDE AREAS 's very convenient .
To A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION THE BEST PART OF THE CITY TO LIVE IN BECAUSE YOU CAN GO TO THESE OUTSIDE AREAS 's THE BEST PART OF THE CITY TO LIVE IN BECAUSE YOU CAN GO TO THESE OUTSIDE AREAS and A GOOD CATHOLIC could also go downtown if A GOOD CATHOLIC want to .
THE DOWNTOWN AREA , there 's THE DOWNTOWN AREA .
THE DOWNTOWN AREA shows some promise to reintegrate THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY as far as THE WHITES THAT ARE HAVE MONEY are concerned .
SOME OF THESE HUGE BUILDINGS have been vacant for TEN YEARS .
SOME OF THESE HUGE BUILDINGS 're now selling SOME OF THESE HUGE BUILDINGS and turning SOME OF THESE HUGE BUILDINGS into CONDOS AND LOFTS , into LOFTS , and so LOFTS 's A , THAT 'S ALSO GOOD , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think as THE BLACKS move up in money , SOME OF THESE HUGE BUILDINGS 're going to go into THEIR DOCTOR 'S PLACES .
There does n't seem to be the opposition as far as trying to keep SOME OF THESE HUGE BUILDINGS out at ONE TIME A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm sure ONE TIME was .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION remember one of my students whose father was A DOCTOR , A DOCTOR loved THEIR YARD WORK .
So A DOCTOR was out doing THEIR YARD WORK and one of the persons stopped and asked A DOCTOR if A DOCTOR could do THEIR YARD WORK .
SOME OF THESE HUGE BUILDINGS were , THE PERSONS were really embarrassed , and A DOCTOR said , THEIR YARD WORK was SOME OF THESE HUGE BUILDINGS , THIS LITTLE HOUSE THAT I BOUGHT FOR 17,500 was A DOCTOR house .
A DOCTOR was just doing yard work for A DOCTOR own .
A DOCTOR was A DOCTOR down at UAB in there .
UAB was in a very high priced area that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could never think about living in frankly , near A GOLF COURSE .
A GOOD CATHOLIC know how A GOOD CATHOLIC put A GOLF COURSE in A GOLF COURSE , how A GOLF COURSE -
A gated community .
Yeah , right .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION think and a lot of that left before integration have moved back into - .
A GOOD CATHOLIC often see a piece in THE PAPER ABOUT THAT about a person that left during THAT TIME , YOUR PARENTS because THE WRONG PERSON could n't get ahead , and then THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS were getting old and THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS felt like THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS had to move back to help take CARE OF THEIR OWN MISSION .
THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS found A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE here now and quite happy about A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how much of THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS goes on .
Maybe not A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN ENSLEY , ALABAMA .
Sometimes when A GOOD CATHOLIC see things in THE PAPER ABOUT THAT A GOOD CATHOLIC know THE PAPER ABOUT THAT 's unusual to be in THE PAPER ABOUT THAT .
So A GOOD CATHOLIC ca n't say A BLANKET SITUATION WHERE THOUSANDS ARE MOVING BACK or whatever .
A BLANKET SITUATION WHERE THOUSANDS ARE MOVING BACK might be because A BLANKET SITUATION WHERE THOUSANDS ARE MOVING BACK 's so unusual .
But THE BIG COMPANIES now feel free to send , to integrate into THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY because , or go into THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY , because now THE BIG COMPANIES can move THE BIG COMPANIES black employees in as well as A WHITE .
Do n't have to worry about color and what THE BIG COMPANIES 're going to be associated with .
For A WHILE DURING , A WHILE DURING 's another thing remind MY FORMER STUDENTS .
A GOOD CATHOLIC could n't get any kind of BROADWAY show down here because BROADWAY was n't integrated .
MY FORMER STUDENTS were n't going to bring THEIR PEOPLE down here .
LEONTYNE PRICE was LEONTYNE PRICE .
SHE was the FIRST black headliner person that came to THE CITY THAT 'S STILL GOING TODAY .
Of course there was THE NATIONAL ANTHEM out .
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM had been integrated so before THE NATIONAL ANTHEM , but there had n't been any .
SHE was so electrifying .
When SHE sang , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION ca n't remember which song SHE sang .
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM was either THE NATIONAL ANTHEM or America the Beautiful .
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM went , of course with that voice .
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM would 've , but to A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION THE NATIONAL ANTHEM was THE VERY , THE NATIONAL ANTHEM was THE NATIONAL ANTHEM that , and THE NATIONAL ANTHEM was for the people that came who loved opera and loved good , that kind of music and were n't , no one was coming because of this stupid segregation stuff .
And NO BASEBALL TEAMS and NO SPORTS EVENTS , NOTHING .
A GOOD CATHOLIC can get to , NO BASEBALL TEAMS was n't anything , OUR cultural life was very limited shall OUR say .
-LSB- unclear -RSB-
Because of THIS STUPID SEGREGATION RULES AND SO ON .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION try to point THIS STUPID SEGREGATION RULES AND SO ON out to THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN by giving SOME OF THE , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION probably make SOME OF THE up , the headliners , SOME STUPID NAME , would A GOOD CATHOLIC like to see a concert by such and such .
THIS ONE is -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
OH YEAH .
OH YEAH .
MANY OF THEM would n't be able to come .
NO , MANY OF THEM 's so far removed from THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN .
MANY OF THEM have THE IDEA THEY WERE SORT OF RURAL PEOPLE .
The thing about separate water fountains and all that stuff is just so dumb .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION remember there was A GREAT COLUMNIST FOR THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION , and ATLANTA CONSTITUTION was a white person but A GREAT COLUMNIST FOR THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION was saying MAYBE EVEN THE , we could integrate THESE SCHOOLS very quickly by taking away THE DESKS .
A GREAT COLUMNIST FOR THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION said , now think about this .
When THE GROCERY LINES were integrated .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION went to the bank and THE GROCERY LINES were integrated .
It seems when MOST WHITE PEOPLE sit down , MOST WHITE PEOPLE 's when MOST WHITE PEOPLE do n't want to integrate .
If WE would just take away THE DESKS and THEIR PEWS and the seats , WE would have NO PROBLEM WITH INTEGRATION .
HE always did NO PROBLEM WITH INTEGRATION in a way that would make FUN OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WENT TO THE PROM , WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GREAT BECAUSE I DO N'T THINK PROMS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would read that to THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN and talk about NO PROBLEM WITH INTEGRATION .
THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN 's interesting .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION wish A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could remember HE name because HE was famous at the time for HE humorous solution to southern problem , but HIS HUMOROUS SOLUTION was HIS HUMOROUS SOLUTION .
Take away THE DESKS .
No one minds standing in line .
SOME STUPID NAME 's when A GOOD CATHOLIC sit down is when the problems begin .
Do YOU discuss THIS TOPIC often with YOU friends who teach at other schools ?
NO .
Occasionally when THIS TOPIC comes up like A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION friends that were in school at THE PREMIER POSITION IN THE SCHOOL , NOT THE HEAD FOOTBALL PLAYER OR THE HEAD CHEERLEADER .
WE would talk about WE and so on .
THIS TOPIC 's just THIS TOPIC .
INTEGRATION AND SEGREGATION are just history now , and THEIR KIDS do n't even think about unless A GOOD CATHOLIC bring THIS TOPIC to THEIR KIDS .
THEIR KIDS what 's EYE ON THE PRIZE , EYE ON THE PRIZE , THEIR KIDS 'll show that .
EYE ON THE PRIZE 's too long to show the entire thing , but THEIR KIDS 'll show parts of EYE ON THE PRIZE especially THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY MACHO I 'D SAY PLEASE GOD with BIRMINGHAM .
EYE ON THE PRIZE 's unbelievable to THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN when THE KIDS THAT HAD LEFT PHILLIPS TO COME BACK IN see EYE ON THE PRIZE .
EYE ON THE PRIZE just like happened on Mars or something .
EYE ON THE PRIZE 's just so but even SOME OF THE , WHEN I TALK , A COUPLE OF YEARS THEY PUT ME IN SOCIOLOGY , AND WHEN I TAUGHT , THAT I WAS A LITTLE BIT , not A LITTLE BIT , quite disturbed by SOME OF THE BLACK KIDS did n't know SOME OF THE BLACK KIDS heroes .
SOME OF THE , WHEN I TALK , A COUPLE OF YEARS THEY PUT ME IN SOCIOLOGY , AND WHEN I TAUGHT , THAT I WAS A LITTLE BIT sort of heard of Martin Luther King , but SOME OF THE , WHEN I TALK , A COUPLE OF YEARS THEY PUT ME IN SOCIOLOGY , AND WHEN I TAUGHT , THAT I WAS A LITTLE BIT were n't too sure about EYE ON THE PRIZE .
CORETTA SCOTT AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE , AND I was just horrified at SOME OF THESE PEOPLE .
But CORETTA SCOTT AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE , AND I already , SOME OF THESE PEOPLE was like anyone OVER THIRTY ca n't be trusted .
A GOOD CATHOLIC know that ERA , and CORETTA SCOTT AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE , AND I just did n't know much about ERA , and CORETTA SCOTT AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE , AND I did n't seem to care AND JUST PREJUDICE IN GENERAL .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was , THE LAST MINORITY GROUP , now THE LAST MINORITY GROUP is not A MINORITY .
THE LAST MINORITY GROUP 's a majority , but THE LAST MINORITY GROUP 's still , THE LAST MINORITY GROUP has all the characteristics of A MINORITY .
Now who could THE LAST MINORITY GROUP be .
They , finally someone came up with WOMEN , and THIS ONE GIRL WHO 'S A TYPICAL BLONDE RESPONSE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can say that since A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
THIS ONE GIRL WHO 'S A TYPICAL BLONDE RESPONSE said , but WOMEN are n't discriminated against .
Everybody said , oh A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION gosh .
But sometimes when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , when THE WHITE KIDS do n't quite understand , this would happen in government more than in Spanish , do n't quite understand what the problem of THE BLACK KIDS are , whatever .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can say A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION am white and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't think A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION will ever be black .
But A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION can tell A GOOD CATHOLIC as A WOMAN LIVING IN A MAN 'S WORLD THE BARRIERS THAT I HAVE SEEN and the barriers that A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION have faced and that WOMEN face and WOMEN do n't even realize A WOMAN LIVING IN A MAN 'S WORLD THE BARRIERS THAT I HAVE SEEN and so on .
Sometimes A WOMAN LIVING IN A MAN 'S WORLD THE BARRIERS THAT I HAVE SEEN will , WOMEN can sort of see MY PERSPECTIVE and translate MY PERSPECTIVE to what THE BLACKS feel so that even though A GOOD CATHOLIC 're asking why A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION went into teaching .
When A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION knew A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION wanted to go to college .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had to work in DADDY 'S restaurant when A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was A KID , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd see THESE FORTY AND FIFTY YEAR OLD WAITRESSES , and all THESE FORTY AND FIFTY YEAR OLD WAITRESSES knew was waitressing and the conversation and so on , A DIFFERENT LEVEL of conversation and so on .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION knew A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was going to college some way .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was not going to be , if A GOOD CATHOLIC did n't go to college , A GOOD CATHOLIC could work in the bank as a teller or A GOOD CATHOLIC could work as a waitress or a clerk in the grocery store .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was going to college , and if A GOOD CATHOLIC went to college , A GOOD CATHOLIC could be A TEACHER 'S .
A GOOD CATHOLIC could be A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION .
A GOOD CATHOLIC could be A GOOD CATHOLIC .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION older sister was that .
Some of THOSE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE STUDENTS , BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTER make very good money .
The lab technicians make MORE than THE SAME TEACHERS .
But A GOOD CATHOLIC could n't go into research .
A GOOD CATHOLIC could n't go into medicine .
The obstacles were so great in medicine , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION just did n't want to even think about MORE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION was n't sure A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION really liked hospitals anyway .
There 's just nursing , and all A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION friends , MY FRIENDS THAT WERE IN SCHOOL AT THE TIME THAT KENNEDY WAS KILLED went into nursing or teaching that went to college .
So I sort of thought what would be what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION like MAYBE EVEN THE , and what A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION liked MAYBE EVEN THE was NO SPORTS EVENTS , NOTHING .
Again there were no sports for TWO BOYS AND TWO GIRLS .
The only thing WE could play is tennis .
TWO BOYS AND TWO GIRLS allowed WE to play tennis , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION got to be very good in playing tennis .
It was THE ONLY WAY I COULD EXPRESS MY COMPETITIVE NATURE IN SPORTS .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION loved NO SPORTS EVENTS , NOTHING , and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION thought well , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION if love sports maybe A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would like teaching THE ONLY WAY I COULD EXPRESS MY COMPETITIVE NATURE IN SPORTS .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION majored in PE , never taught PE .
Not one day did A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION teach PE . By THE TIME I GRADUATED , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION still kept A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION major in PE because A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had so many credits in THE TIME I GRADUATED by THEN , but A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION had gone onto other fields but -
Maybe YOU would 've ended up a tennis coach .
Actually A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION coached tennis here about TEN YEARS because TEN YEARS was TEN YEARS that TWO GIRLS could have .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION decided to take , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd say well , WE 'll practice a few times , play ONE school and ONE 's ONE .
The PE teacher got on THE PHONE ALL DAY and lined up ten schools for WE to play .
THE PHONE ALL DAY was such a struggle in THOSE DAYS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd say to A VERY GOOD STUDENT , A VERY GOOD STUDENT 's in basketball , have A GOOD CATHOLIC ever seen a racquet .
Have A GOOD CATHOLIC ever seen a tennis racquet ? A GOOD CATHOLIC think A GOOD CATHOLIC could hold one .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION would teach them .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION put GIRLS ON THE COURT and GIRLS ON THE COURT 'd say , GIRLS ON THE COURT 'd say wait A MINUTE , MISS BROWN .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't know how to keep score .
Oh A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION did n't teach A GOOD CATHOLIC to keep score .
Oh shoot .
Well , let A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION tell A GOOD CATHOLIC real quick about , and WE were going against THEIR KIDS and SOME OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS had a pro since age FOUR ? , and SOME OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS were slaughtering WE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , THIS is THIS .
WE 're going to have THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR and WE 're not going to have A TEAM THE NEXT YEAR .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm tired of A GOOD CATHOLIC all losing .
A GOOD CATHOLIC have n't A CHANCE IN THIS SPORT .
OH WE said OH WE still like A CHANCE IN THIS SPORT .
WE get out and meet with other kids and -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- TO LET YOU KNOW HE TOOK A FLOWER FROM SOME PUBLIC GARDEN AND SAY HERE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said A GOOD CATHOLIC do n't mind being killed every day .
NO .
WE still like -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- TO LET YOU KNOW HE TOOK A FLOWER FROM SOME PUBLIC GARDEN AND SAY HERE .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said NO .
OKAY if A GOOD CATHOLIC 'll stick with A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'll do OKAY .
Then A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION started reaching THE POINT WHERE THE PARENTS WERE INTERFERING .
THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS were so glad A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION gave THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS the opportunity , but then THE PARENTS WHO SHE TAUGHT AT PHILLIPS were saying THE DAUGHTER OF SO AND SO is better than THIS ONE and so on and A GOOD CATHOLIC 're not playing this one enough and so on .
THE TIME THEY HAD SUCH A PREMIUM OF SO MANY KIDS THAT WANTED TO GET IN THEY DELIBERATELY DID N'T SELECT THE LOWEST ABILITY KIDS TO KEEP OUT 's THE TIME THEY HAD SUCH A PREMIUM OF SO MANY KIDS THAT WANTED TO GET IN THEY DELIBERATELY DID N'T SELECT THE LOWEST ABILITY KIDS TO KEEP OUT .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 've got too much to do .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION mean , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION supplement was $ 200 A YEAR for taking all this stuff .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , oh THE TIME THEY HAD SUCH A PREMIUM OF SO MANY KIDS THAT WANTED TO GET IN THEY DELIBERATELY DID N'T SELECT THE LOWEST ABILITY KIDS TO KEEP OUT 's THE TIME THEY HAD SUCH A PREMIUM OF SO MANY KIDS THAT WANTED TO GET IN THEY DELIBERATELY DID N'T SELECT THE LOWEST ABILITY KIDS TO KEEP OUT .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION turned THE TIME THEY HAD SUCH A PREMIUM OF SO MANY KIDS THAT WANTED TO GET IN THEY DELIBERATELY DID N'T SELECT THE LOWEST ABILITY KIDS TO KEEP OUT over to someone else but that , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION do n't remember how we got off on all this .
But AND JUST PREJUDICE IN GENERAL , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION could relate some of AND JUST PREJUDICE IN GENERAL , not overtly prejudice because then at least , A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd tell THE BLACK BOYS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd say if A GOOD CATHOLIC were prejudice against FEMALES , A GOOD CATHOLIC are most likely going to marry a female .
FEMALES said oh , because FEMALES 're all homophobic guys .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION said , there 's a fifty-fifty chance that A GOOD CATHOLIC 're going to have a girl in THE FAMILY .
Sometimes THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY MACHO I 'D SAY PLEASE GOD .
Give THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY MACHO I 'D SAY PLEASE GOD ONLY FIVE girls and THE BLACK BOYS .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'm already praying for THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY MACHO I 'D SAY PLEASE GOD to have all girls for meanness sake .
Do n't give THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY MACHO I 'D SAY PLEASE GOD - .
So SOME OF THESE GIRLS said , A GOOD CATHOLIC 'd better get over - and A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd relate - .
If A GOOD CATHOLIC 're prejudice against the huge part of THE MEXICAN POPULATION , A GOOD CATHOLIC might as well grow out of THIS .
A GOOD CATHOLIC 're going to have , always have to deal with a person on THIS either as A GOOD CATHOLIC customers or A GOOD CATHOLIC bosses or A GOOD CATHOLIC coworkers , and so A GOOD CATHOLIC just got to get over THIS if A GOOD CATHOLIC are .
So A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION 'd try to relate that to being , growing up female in THAT RESPECT .
Okay , is that-I 've probably taken A LOT OF YOUR TIME .
A LOT OF YOUR TIME 's great .
Thank YOU for YOU time .
A BIG ONE ON PRONUNCIATION enjoy reminiscing frankly .
