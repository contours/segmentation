This is KIMBERLY HILL and KIMBERLY HILL am talking with THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR June 16 , 2005 .
Thank YOU for having KIMBERLY HILL and thank YOU for the lemonade .
YOU 're welcome .
WE are going to start by talking about how YOU FIRST became interested in becoming A TEACHER and about YOU childhood .
Where do THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR start with WE , because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was not interested in becoming A TEACHER until later in life ? YOUR CHILDHOOD was interesting now that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR look back on THAT , BECAUSE I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN BECOMING A TEACHER UNTIL LATER IN LIFE .
There was MUCH HARD WORK as a child of A SHARE CROPPER , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR never had THE OPPORTUNITY OF ATTENDING SCHOOL FOR THE FULL NINE MONTHS .
Usually SEVEN , sometimes SIX and a half months because the crops had to be planted , tended and reaped .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was interested early on in the printed word in BOOKS .
WE had very few books .
There was always A BIBLE .
WE did something in WE home that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR see DESIGNERS DOING NOW ; WE papered WE walls with THE PAGES from MAGAZINES .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR learned later that THE PAGES were not only for a pleasing appearance , but DESIGNERS DOING NOW served as insulation because SHARE CROPPER 'S TENANT HOUSES were A SHARE CROPPER tenant houses .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR read what was on OUR WALLS , and sometimes THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would do MY INTEREST IN READING ; if THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR found a page with part of A SCHOOL MRS. KING GRADUATED FROM THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'd read that part again and again and again hoping and wishing that somehow THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would find the other part of A SCHOOL MRS. KING GRADUATED FROM .
Of course MY INTEREST IN READING was plastered against THE WALL , so there was no way of ever doing THE WALL .
MY INTEREST IN READING was MY INTEREST IN READING , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR find MY INTEREST IN READING very difficult to get rid of anything that has print on MY INTEREST IN READING no matter what , MAGAZINES , papers , college books THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have every book THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have ever read all over MY HOUSE and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR basement .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR learned a lot on the farm .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR learned discipline .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR learned how to manage MY TIME well .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR lived with THAT FAMILY , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR always knew that .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR lived with THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR grandparents THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME ; THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did n't leave MARION ROGERS until THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was seventeen , and so leaving there was coming into a whole new world for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
There was also THE FUN OF JUMPING INTO CREEKS AND HUNTING MUSCADINES AND BLACKBERRIES , as opposed to what MUCH HARD WORK was , like taking care of cows and mules , MUCH HARD WORK .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR still learned discipline and THE FUN OF JUMPING INTO CREEKS AND HUNTING MUSCADINES AND BLACKBERRIES has been very important in MY LIFE .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think that all of my relatives but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR FIRST cousins were like brothers and sisters to THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR aunts and uncles were like YOUR PARENTS , so WE were a large family but WE knew everybody .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't find that to be THE CASE as much now .
There was great respect for ELDERS and for THE KNOWLEDGE that ELDERS had .
Going to town on Saturday was a big deal .
Having MAJOR DAYS AT THE CHURCHES , THE ANNIVERSARIES , THE SOCIETY TURNOUTS with great food and getting a chance to speak to a boy , who was not allowed to come to YOU house , but YOU could talk on the church grounds .
So , MAJOR DAYS AT THE CHURCHES , THE ANNIVERSARIES , THE SOCIETY TURNOUTS was life for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR growing up .
For THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL there were no buses for THAT CHILDREN , so WE got to school THE BEST WAY WE COULD and SO MANY TIMES THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL was to walk the distance into town .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR high school was founded by the American Missionary Society in 1867 and so that was the one school .
THE TRAINING SCHOOL FOR BLACK CHILDREN , AFRICAN AMERICANS was in Uniontown MILES away but EIGHTEEN was established much later .
THE SCHOOLS were designated TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR BLACK CHILDREN AND HIGH SCHOOLS FOR WHITE CHILDREN .
So WE were trainable , but not teachable .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have ONE BROTHER and ONE SISTER .
ONE SISTER is deceased and ONE BROTHER lives here .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had two cousins that lived with WE and THEY were THEY that WE lived together .
BIOLOGICAL IN THE SENSE 's pretty much BIOLOGICAL IN THE SENSE for growing up , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR learned from A GREAT FARMER to fear .
A GREAT FARMER had no fears of anything or anybody .
A GREAT FARMER was A GREAT FARMER until THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was THEN TEN and A GREAT FARMER was probably SEVENTY FIVE or so then .
MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER was as DEVOUT as anyone can be .
It was unusual for MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER to be as DEVOUT as MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER was , and MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER was MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR still would like to be the woman MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER was , THE LOVE , the kindnesses , and the patience .
A GREAT FARMER said there was nothing to THE LOVE , but at about age SEVENTY FIVE A GREAT FARMER had A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE .
We did n't know A GREAT FARMER could sing until THE LOVE happened , and A GREAT FARMER would sing .
Did A GREAT FARMER start singing in church ?
A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER .
A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER would just sit on A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER porch and sing .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR just learned from A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER not to fear .
A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER said `` YOU body can be destroyed , but not YOU mind . ''
Oddly enough , THE LAST WORDS TO ME was not to be careful as THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was leaving home to go to college , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had one foot on the step on the bus and A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER touched THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR on the shoulder and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR turned thinking A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER was going to tell THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR to be careful , and A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER said , `` Do n't go down there to THE TRAINING SCHOOL FOR BLACK CHILDREN , AFRICAN AMERICANS and come back here ONLY A FOOL . ''
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR eventually learned what A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER meant , and yet A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER was A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER .
A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER was born as A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER said , THE YEAR THE COUNTRY SURRENDERED , WHICH IS PROBABLY 1865 .
THE YEAR THE COUNTRY SURRENDERED , WHICH IS PROBABLY 1865 's THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR background of approaching THOSE THINGS , being disciplined and not being afraid , learning how to measure real fear or danger .
ONE does not have to be afraid of a rattlesnake , but YOU recognize that A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER is a snake and A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER is poisonous and YOU act accordingly .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR learned much of ONE from A GREAT FARMER .
A GREAT FARMER was A GREAT FARMER , A GREAT FARMER could grow anything .
It was A GREAT FARMER profound belief that land could not be owned , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR still do not understand all of that , YOU can buy A CAR and own A CAR but not land .
Someone told THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR that GOD 'S LAND was also GOD 'S LAND , that the land was there , GOD 'S LAND 's GOD 'S land and GOD 'S LAND belongs to everybody .
GOD 'S LAND 's when KIMBERLY HILL FIRST heard of GOD 'S LAND .
GOD 'S sounds like a deep man .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did n't realize how deep until years later , just looking at GOD 'S life and trying to work out just what there was about GOD 'S .
GOD 'S loved MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER deeply , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR thought all men did MY LIFE .
GOD 'S 'd go out into the fields , and if peaches or berries were in AN APPLE , GOD 'S 'd bring something back for MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER .
GOD 'S 'd put AN APPLE in MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER lap if MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER was sitting or in MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER pockets if MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER was standing , working at the stove .
If GOD 'S went into town , even if AN APPLE was just AN APPLE or a stick of PEPPERMINT CANDY , always GOD 'S would do PEPPERMINT CANDY .
So THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR thought all men did THAT WHEN THEY LEFT HOME , UPON THEIR RETURN .
Not expensive , THAT WHEN THEY LEFT HOME , UPON THEIR RETURN would bring something , a token of THE LOVE .
High standards .
LAUGHTER
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had to teach MY HUSBAND .
LAUGHTER -RSB- THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had to tell MY HUSBAND , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR thought all men did that , MY HUSBAND learned .
MY HUSBAND 's deceased though .
Is that enough about THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR background ?
Sure , THE YEAR THE COUNTRY SURRENDERED , WHICH IS PROBABLY 1865 can be enough .
What made YOU decide to go to college ?
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR knew THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would not pick HIS COTTON .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR knew THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was not going to be a maid all of my life .
So THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR FIRST option since we were very poor was that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR join the armed forces , and use that to go to college .
However , that year Dillard University gave TUITION SCHOLARSHIPS to valedictorians and salutatorians , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know from around the Southeast .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR got that scholarship .
A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS was for tuition .
A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS was A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would work for a white family on the weekends and in the winter when we did n't have crop work to do .
THEY knew a family in NEW ORLEANS , and A COLONEL AT MARION MILITARY INSTITUTE was A COLONEL AT MARION MILITARY INSTITUTE .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR told THEY that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had A TUITION SCHOLARSHIP , so THEY wrote to THAT FAMILY and asked if THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR could live in THEY home and work for ROOM AND BOARD .
THEY did not need anyone , but looked for A FRIEND OF THEIRS and THEY 's what happened .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had A TUITION SCHOLARSHIP and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR got off the bus in NEW ORLEANS and someone picked THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR up and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR went to a private home to work for ROOM AND BOARD so that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR could go to college .
So THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR never lived in FIFTEEN YEARS and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked for AND THREE different families during A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS .
FIFTEEN YEARS was FIFTEEN YEARS , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am not going to be A MAID , or a cook , or a dishwasher or a share cropper for all the time that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had left , whether FIFTEEN YEARS is FIFTEEN YEARS or FIFTY YEARS , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am not going to do FIFTY YEARS .
FIFTEEN YEARS was on school , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was going to go to school .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was fortunate enough to have A GOOD EXPERIENCE in between THE CLASSES , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked for a couple of professors and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR mentioned the research assistant work with DR. DANIEL THOMPSON ON THE follow up of children of bondage , so that was a little income during THE SUMMER TO HELP ME WITH BOOKS .
Also with THE CAUSES OF DELINQUENCY IN NEW ORLEANS , NEW ORLEANS was extra income to help THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR also .
THE CAUSES OF DELINQUENCY IN NEW ORLEANS was FIFTEEN YEARS .
Sounds like FIFTEEN YEARS was YOU family heritage , being very driven and knowing what YOU wanted .
Just working , having a sense of ethics about working .
Work hard for what YOU want and be honest .
Have integrity .
When THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was A MAID , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was a good one .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR knew what to do , so NO ONE could say NO THIS is sloppy or NO THIS is not what WE want .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did not go to college to teach , NO ONE was something that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was not going to do .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was fascinated with DR. THOMPSON AND JOE TAYLOR , who were THE SOCIOLOGY PROFESSORS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was fascinated with language , with Dr. Swurdlow , and WE had names for DR. THOMPSON AND JOE TAYLOR .
ONE TEACHER WE CALLED `` ZEUS '' BECAUSE HE just reminded WE of THE GREEK GOD ZEUS .
WE had RESEARCH PEOPLE .
WE had SOMEONE WE CALLED `` ELEVATED BOOGIE '' BECAUSE HE WORE SHOES WITH LIFTS IN THEM and ONE TEACHER WE CALLED `` ZEUS '' BECAUSE HE caused SOMEONE WE CALLED `` ELEVATED BOOGIE '' BECAUSE HE WORE SHOES WITH LIFTS IN THEM to sway when SOMEONE WE CALLED `` ELEVATED BOOGIE '' BECAUSE HE WORE SHOES WITH LIFTS IN THEM walked .
RESEARCH PEOPLE were RESEARCH PEOPLE and RESEARCH PEOPLE talked about Kenneth Cole and RESEARCH PEOPLE talked about A PHILLIP RANDOLPH , who was just beginning HIS PRIME WORK .
RESEARCH PEOPLE talked about Gunnar Myrdal and THOSE THINGS were fascinating to THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR decided THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR wanted to be a sociologist and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR wanted to do research .
So THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR graduated from DILLARD and went to FISK , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was there for A YEAR .
In January , PROFESSOR VALLIAN was the head of the department then and sent a team of AND THREE of us to MONTGOMERY because PROFESSOR VALLIAN felt that based on the criteria for social movements that THE BUS BOYCOTT was actually THE BUS BOYCOTT .
So , WE went to just interview and talk with PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT .
Yeah .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think WE were there for three weeks .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR interviewed MRS. PARKS IN HER HOME .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR rode in a cab with MRS. PARKS IN HER HOME .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR went to MASS MEETINGS and recorded the songs and what was said ; THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR only kept AND THREE .
The one with MRS. PARKS IN HER HOME and what happened THE FIRST TIME the Kings ' home was bombed .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't know why PRESTON VALLIAN never wrote HIS BOOK .
The white girl ANN HOLDEN , from Georgia interviewed white folks .
ANN HOLDEN had the southern drawl , so ANN HOLDEN -
Did ANN HOLDEN publish HIS BOOK ?
NO THIS was all for FISK .
WE had to send WE interviews back to WE professors , because OUR STUDENTS were OUR STUDENTS .
There were three students in the department at MY TIME , TWO blacks and one white , in the graduate Sociology Department at FISK .
INTERESTING DAYS were INTERESTING DAYS .
As WE stood outside THE KING HOME after everyone arrived there from THE CHURCH after THE NEWS came that FISK home had been bombed , THE REFUSAL TO LISTEN TO THE MAYOR OR THE CITY COMMISSIONER AND THEN TO HAVE HIM , THE REFUSAL TO LISTEN TO THE MAYOR OR THE CITY COMMISSIONER AND THEN TO HAVE HIM come out and wave FISK hand in absolute silence .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR talked THE BEST WAY WE COULD into going in .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR told THE MAYOR OR THE CITY COMMISSIONER , `` MRS. KING is from THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR hometown and MRS. KING needs THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , and THE MAYOR OR THE CITY COMMISSIONER let THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR go in . ''
MRS. KING did n't know THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR because MRS. KING graduated a few years before THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , in fact MRS. KING was n't even at Lincoln while THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was there .
MRS. KING was in MY SCHOOL , but MY HUSBAND was n't MY HUSBAND at A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did n't know MY HUSBAND .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR knew MY HUSBAND and did n't know MY HUSBAND at A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR came in and said `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm from MARION ROGERS , BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ON THURSDAY and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm here to do whatever BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ON THURSDAY is that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can do to help get through THIS NIGHT . ''
So , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was there for the remainder of THIS NIGHT and into the next day .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR took CARE OF THE BABY ; THEY had a new baby that THEY called Yokie .
PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT called , SOME said SOME were sorry and OTHERS said OTHERS brought CARE OF THE BABY on OTHERS .
THE OTHERS called and said ` WE missed A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS , but WE 'll get YOU next time . '
It was ugly what some people did .
A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE was also A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE -
SOME GOOD MEMORIES .
Not even realizing how SOME GOOD MEMORIES . was all going to play out .
ONE writer said , do SOME GOOD MEMORIES . ever realize life , why SOME GOOD MEMORIES . live ONE ? What is OUR TOWN ? '' THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think ONE 's `` OUR TOWN '' by Thornton Wilder , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't know since THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have been out of THE CLASSROOM for so long .
Basically , ONE 's that SOME GOOD MEMORIES . do n't fully realize ONE as SOME GOOD MEMORIES . live ONE , ONE 's looking back that SOME GOOD MEMORIES . see .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR knew ONE was important , but the historical role was something THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did not fully fathom at A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR came home THE END OF THAT YEAR and went to MARION ROGERS with THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR cousin and met MY HUSBAND .
So there were TWO jobs in MARION ROGERS , BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ON THURSDAY , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would either work at the Laundromat or teach .
Now remember , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did not go to school to do TWO JOBS IN MARION , ALABAMA , but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'll teach .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had a double major , because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR loved literature and English .
THE SUPERINTENDENT there discovered that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had been in MONTGOMERY doing THE BUS BOYCOTT and did n't hire THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR got A GOOD EXPERIENCE in TUSCALOOSA working at Turrett High School .
What THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR recognize is that life has a way of getting from YOU what YOU are here to do , and nothing in MY LIFE could have been any more glorious than teaching .
Not instructing , there is A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A PROFESSOR , AN INSTRUCTOR and being A TEACHER .
THE HIGHEST CALLING , BECAUSE YOU TEACH THEM ALL is THE HIGHEST CALLING , BECAUSE YOU TEACH THEM ALL .
What do YOU mean YOU teach THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR all ?
All children , THE HIGHEST CALLING , BECAUSE YOU TEACH THEM ALL 's biblical .
Who so ever will , let HIM come .
Especially in a public school , HIM will not look at A CHILD and make the decision about LIFE that HIM can or can not learn or that HIM should be denied certain opportunities because of HIM color or HIM ability .
Well , YOU do n't need THIS COURSE or that course because of some superficial reason .
If for example , in YOU family there are THREE CHILDREN and one is super bright , and ANOTHER ONE is average and ANOTHER ONE is slow .
Something is wrong if YOU parents decide that THE ONE WHO IS A MATH WHIZ labeled slow-and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't like labeling kids-should not have THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS THE OTHERS .
Now the extent to which YOUR PARENTS can take advantage may be limited , but YOUR PARENTS need THE OPPORTUNITY OF ATTENDING SCHOOL FOR THE FULL NINE MONTHS .
Just two weeks ago THE SYSTEM WHO ARE MEMBERS OF MY CHURCH wanted to test , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have TWIN GRANDSONS , and TWIN GRANDSONS wanted to test THE ONE WHO IS A MATH WHIZ and YOUR PARENTS said no , YOU have to test BOTH OF THEM .
A SLOPPY ONE , WHO WRITES ONE SENTENCE WHEN HE IS SUPPOSED TO WRITE AN ENTIRE PAGE is A SLOPPY ONE , WHO WRITES ONE SENTENCE WHEN HE IS SUPPOSED TO WRITE AN ENTIRE PAGE , and BOTH OF THEM will just erase stuff .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't mean A SLOPPY PERSON , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR mean in HIS PRIME WORK .
A SLOPPY PERSON just thinks anything will do .
So A SLOPPY PERSON 's -
A SLOPPY PERSON met THE STANDARDS OF WHATEVER THEY SAID ABOUT BEING GIFTED , but THE ONE WHO IS A MATH WHIZ did not test at that level .
WHATEVER test WHATEVER are using wo n't dictate what WHATEVER are going to do in life or how well WHATEVER are going to do .
If WHATEVER were THE CASE , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't think any of us would ever move beyond or would have moved much beyond slavery .
Surely DUBOIS would not have worked and , what 's DUBOIS name , Douglass .
Definitely FREDERICK would not have done what FREDERICK did if THE RIGHT NAME was THE CASE .
THE RIGHT NAME 's true .
So , we are saying just give them THE OPPORTUNITY OF ATTENDING SCHOOL FOR THE FULL NINE MONTHS .
So , after YOU got married and became A TEACHER in TUSCALOOSA then eventually YOU ended up teaching in THE BIRMINGHAM .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR taught for A YEAR and a half at TUSCALOOSA .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR taught EMR CHILDREN THE FIRST YEAR and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR loved EMR CHILDREN so much that THE FIRST YEAR bothered THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR sometimes that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR could n't get EMR CHILDREN where THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR wanted EMR CHILDREN to be in short periods of A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS .
So again , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had to learn patience with EMR CHILDREN .
WE did all of the content , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had a young lady come in from THE COUNTRY and bring tadpoles .
WE charted EMR CHILDREN growth for WE biology , and one Monday morning WE walked in and little bitty frogs were hopping all over THE CLASSROOM .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- WE brought cans from grocery stores and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR taught EMR CHILDREN how to stock EMR CHILDREN and how to arrange EMR CHILDREN .
ONE YOUNG MAN IN PARTICULAR , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked night and day to move ONE YOUNG MAN IN PARTICULAR from counting STRIPS OF PAPER to transferring that to numerical symbols .
WE worked on helping ONE YOUNG MAN IN PARTICULAR understand that if ONE has one apple and another apple that 's TWO apples , but then taking ONE to the next step , to get ONE YOUNG MAN IN PARTICULAR to transfer that to the symbol for TWO .
ONE was very , very difficult .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR refused to give up and ONE YOUNG MAN IN PARTICULAR refused to give up and ONE was ONE .
ONE YOUNG MAN IN PARTICULAR had THE WAY KIDS ARE , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am going to understand that THE SYMBOL FOR THREE is THE SYMBOL FOR THREE and THE SYMBOL FOR THREE is THE SYMBOL FOR THREE and when YOU add THEM together THEM make the symbol SEVEN . '
After ABOUT SIX MONTHS ONE YOUNG MAN IN PARTICULAR picked ABOUT SIX MONTHS up .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was happy and ONE YOUNG MAN IN PARTICULAR was happy .
So , ABOUT SIX MONTHS was good .
Then THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR came to THE BIRMINGHAM , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR mother was here .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had MY TWO BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN and MY HUSBAND had A SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHEN I MARRIED HIM .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR found TWO very difficult to think of A SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHEN I MARRIED HIM as a stepdaughter .
PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT will look at THE DATE OF HER BIRTH and try and connect how old THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was , especially one of the teachers that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked with who was married to one of the teachers that taught THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR in high school , because at A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS GIRLS had to drop out of school if GIRLS became pregnant .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR never told MY HUSBAND , MY HUSBAND would just look at THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR and try and figure THE DATE OF HER BIRTH out how this happened .
A SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHEN I MARRIED HIM is deceased ; A SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHEN I MARRIED HIM died of a brain aneurysm THE FULL NINE MONTHS after MY HUSBAND passed .
MOST PEOPLE did n't know that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was not THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
MOST PEOPLE would say ` YOU never said ... ' and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR felt there was no reason to separate children .
`` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT did n't know until THE TENTH GRADE that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was not JEANNIE 'S biological mother .
THE TENTH GRADE was not anything hidden , there was just no reason to say that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT stepmother and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm MOST PEOPLE mother .
When THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR married MY HUSBAND `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT became A CHILD .
Yup , and YOU raised THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR all together ?
Yes , and A CHILD 's what WE said in MY HUSBAND obituary , together WE reared THREE CHILDREN .
A CHILD is what WE did .
ME , WHICH IS MORE LIKE ME THAN THE ONES BIOLOGICAL attended BIRMINGHAM SOUTHERN and worked for Bellsouth after ME , WHICH IS MORE LIKE ME THAN THE ONES BIOLOGICAL graduated and did very well .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR guess THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT MY HUSBAND EVER PAID ME WAS TO SAY TO ME ` IF I JUST DID N'T KNOW BETTER , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would swear that YOU had ME , WHICH IS MORE LIKE ME THAN THE ONES BIOLOGICAL . '
So , ME , WHICH IS MORE LIKE ME THAN THE ONES BIOLOGICAL was that much like THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , which is more like THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR than THE BEST ONES biological THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR guess .
THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT MY HUSBAND EVER PAID ME WAS TO SAY TO ME ` IF I JUST DID N'T KNOW BETTER was THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT MY HUSBAND EVER PAID ME WAS TO SAY TO ME ` IF I JUST DID N'T KNOW BETTER that MY HUSBAND could have paid THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , to say that about JEANNIE 'S .
THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT MY HUSBAND EVER PAID ME WAS TO SAY TO ME ` IF I JUST DID N'T KNOW BETTER 's THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT MY HUSBAND EVER PAID ME WAS TO SAY TO ME ` IF I JUST DID N'T KNOW BETTER .
WE have been doing a lot of crying SEVEN YEAR because JOHN , THE BABY was TWELVE WHEN SHE DIED and JOHN has been in the different bowls or something .
JOHN graduated from high school and L just look at `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT and say THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm not going to cry and `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT says `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT 's not going to cry either .
Then THE TEARS just roll .
WE think of `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT and what `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT meant to all of us .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm rambling , am THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR not ? -LSB- Laughter -RSB-
WE 's okay .
What school were YOU at just before YOU went to CARROLL W. HAYES ?
TUSCALOOSA .
CARROLL W. HAYES was the only high school THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked at in THE BIRMINGHAM .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR started at CARROLL W. HAYES in 1963 .
Can YOU tell US just A BIT ABOUT HAYES ' HISTORY ? How A BIT ABOUT HAYES ' HISTORY started KIMBERLY HILL mean .
Yes , CARROLL W. HAYES and CARVER were built to keep THAT CHILDREN from attending , to protect WOODLAWN HIGH SCHOOL , PLUS WE , which were all white .
If US put THESE SCHOOLS IN STRATEGIC POSITIONS and THE REASONING BEHIND BUILDING THOSE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY WERE , THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA would not attend WOODLAWN , THAT WAS YOUR CITY CENTER or PHILLIPS .
PHILLIPS was downtown .
THE REASONING BEHIND BUILDING THOSE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY WERE was THE REASONING BEHIND BUILDING THOSE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY WERE , and to do THE REASONING BEHIND BUILDING THOSE SCHOOLS WHERE THEY WERE quickly .
THE FIRST PRINCIPAL OF HAYES , A.C. DICKENSON , WHO DIED NOT SO LONG AGO , wanted ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL .
THE FIRST PRINCIPAL OF HAYES , A.C. DICKENSON , WHO DIED NOT SO LONG AGO did n't want any names of animals , THE FIRST PRINCIPAL OF HAYES , A.C. DICKENSON , WHO DIED NOT SO LONG AGO said , `` We 're going to be HAYES HIGH PACESETTERS . ''
So HAYES HIGH PACESETTERS is what HAYES HIGH PACESETTERS are called .
KIMBERLY HILL heard that THE FIRST PRINCIPAL OF HAYES , A.C. DICKENSON , WHO DIED NOT SO LONG AGO wanted CARROLL W. HAYES to have THE BEST BLACK TEACHERS IN THE DISTRICT and the best programs for OUR STUDENTS .
THE FIRST PRINCIPAL OF HAYES , A.C. DICKENSON , WHO DIED NOT SO LONG AGO accomplished that .
ANDREW ABERCROMBIE did class day activities that would rival something from Broadway .
Once ANDREW ABERCROMBIE redecorated the gym into a Hawaiian paradise and momentarily YOU thought YOU were in Hawaii .
ANDREW ABERCROMBIE was just that good .
Was ANDREW ABERCROMBIE one of the teachers ?
ANDREW ABERCROMBIE was A TEACHER ; ANDREW ABERCROMBIE was head of the English department .
MARION ROGERS produced plays for `` Raisin in the Sun '' - -LSB- Phone ringing -RSB-
YOU could suspend -LSB- imagination -RSB- and think that YOU were actually viewing SHARE CROPPER 'S TENANT HOUSES .
Laverne Cromer had A CHOIR THAT WOULD RIVAL JUST ABOUT ANY COLLEGE CHOIR .
WE sent OUR STUDENTS to Massachusetts Institute of Technology , GEORGE RITZER was GEORGE RITZER .
PACESETTERS WITH STATE TROOPERS were PACESETTERS WITH STATE TROOPERS ; WE had THE FIRST FEMALE STATE TROOPER IN ALABAMA .
FIRST was THE FIRST FEMALE , not the FIRST black female , but THE FIRST FEMALE STATE TROOPER IN ALABAMA , Clarisse England .
A picture of THE FIRST FEMALE was in THE T.V. SHOW -RSB- `` GOOD TIMES .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had asked THE FIRST FEMALE repeatedly to write THE FIRST FEMALE story in a little booklet and get A SCHOOL MRS. KING GRADUATED FROM published .
THE FIRST FEMALE should .
OUR Band Director was superb , Mechanical Drawing TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART .
TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART called OUR Little University sometimes .
LAUGHTER -RSB- OUR did , OUR had a wonderful faculty .
CAROL ROBERTSON 'S MOTHER was OUR librarian during the 1970s and CAROL ROBERTSON 'S MOTHER had reading clubs and CAROL ROBERTSON 'S MOTHER published CAROL ROBERTSON 'S MOTHER monthly bulletins `` MRS. CREWS ' CLASS is reading , Mrs. Finch 's class is reading , Mrs. Collin 's ... ''
THE P.E. TEACHER was even a reader , oh and smart too , JOSETTE COLLINS 'S .
One year THE SENIORS had THE P.E. TEACHER , Mrs. Finch for SECOND period and Josette Collins for THIRD period .
THE SENIORS said , `` OUR give up , OUR 'll come back next year , OUR can not do AND THREE . ''
OUR had PRIDE IN THE SCHOOL , PRIDE IN THE SCHOOL and pride in THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO .
OUR taught THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO , ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL is YOU school .
What do YOU want PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT to think about YOU school ? Then what must YOU do in order to generate that ? PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT had PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT FIRST major reunion in December of last year , maybe , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm not sure when .
There were PEOPLE WHO CAME THAT DID NOT HAVE TICKETS , WHO COULD NOT GET IN BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY FULL AT THE SHERATON .
There is still STILL A LOT OF PRIDE IN THE SCHOOL . ?
STILL A LOT OF PRIDE IN THE SCHOOL .
PEOPLE WHO CAME THAT DID NOT HAVE TICKETS , WHO COULD NOT GET IN BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY FULL AT THE SHERATON had given TUITION SCHOLARSHIPS now because STILL A LOT OF PRIDE IN THE SCHOOL . was changed to a middle school and now WOODLAWN HIGH SCHOOL , PLUS WE 's WOODLAWN HIGH SCHOOL , PLUS WE again .
WE had wonderful coaches .
YOU could n't go and play basketball or football like RUN-OF-THE-MILL FOLKS did , YOU had to have YOU hair cut and YOU had to be clean and PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT had to know YOU were HAYES HIGH PACESETTERS .
WE had WONDERFUL BULLETIN BOARDS .
For THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR it was a good place to work .
WE had GOOD MATH TEACHERS .
Were YOU teaching English ?
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR taught English the entire time .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would rotate up and down ; THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR always wanted to teach all levels .
Especially when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR became department chair , so that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would know what was going on at the other levels .
If THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had TWELVE WHEN SHE DIED THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would take A NINE , or a THEN TEN and an eleven .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would go back and forth , to keep up with OUR STUDENTS .
THEY would tell YOU there were only two excuses for not having YOU work ; either YOU house burned or YOU died , both of which WE could verify .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- THEY just laughed and said come on .
THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS now will say , ` why do WE have A TEST AFTER A FOOTBALL GAME ? ' THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would tell THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS that THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS knew in advance about A TEST AFTER A FOOTBALL GAME , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would n't give THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS pop quizzes to fail THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS .
YOU do n't give exams to fail OUR STUDENTS , YOU want to know actually what THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA know .
The tests allow THE TEACHERS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE SCHOOLS to assess THE TEACHERS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE SCHOOLS and discover what needs to be taught again , what YOU did not teach well or where misunderstandings have taken place .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR told THE ATHLETES , `` YOU knew A FOOTBALL GAME was Thursday night and YOU knew A TEST AFTER A FOOTBALL GAME was Friday , YOU had time to prepare .
Just as YOU prepare for A FOOTBALL GAME , YOU prepare for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR . ''
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did n't care for A FOOTBALL GAME ?
THE ATHLETES 'd talk about A FOOTBALL GAME , but THE ATHLETES did well anyway .
Now THE ATHLETES tell THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR THE ATHLETES understand why .
If YOU are assigned to THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR from EIGHT until NINE , then YOU belong to THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
YOU do not belong to YOU coach , and YOU are responsible for MRS. CREWS ' CLASS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have met OUR STUDENTS and some who have come to THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR in THE TEARS to say ` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm glad to see YOU because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR wanted to let YOU know how important YOU were to THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR ' .
OUR STUDENTS is what makes teaching worthwhile .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think we taught more about integrity and honesty than anything else .
YOU need to be good men and women .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR remember teaching something in eleventh grade about CHARACTER AND SOMETHING else , and the paper that CHARACTER AND SOMETHING were to write said ` when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am THIRTY . '
THE TEACHERS WHO GOT TOGETHER FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT gave THE TEACHERS WHO GOT TOGETHER FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT A HOUSE , a bank account and A CAR , so when THE TEACHERS WHO GOT TOGETHER FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT wrote the paper THE TEACHERS WHO GOT TOGETHER FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT could n't write about a five bedroom mansion or THIS KIND OF CAR because THIS KIND OF CAR was THIS KIND OF CAR .
ONE young man wrote that when ONE YOUNG MAN was THIRTY ONE YOUNG MAN would have made an honorable man of ONE YOUNG MAN , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR remember that because THIRTY is what ONE YOUNG MAN did .
ONE YOUNG MAN became an honorable man .
If THE TEACHERS WHO GOT TOGETHER FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT made a million dollars that was fine , but please become HONORABLE MEN AND WOMEN .
ONE was ONE .
OUR knew that OUR were in a sense parents and that OUR were taught to be GOOD MATH TEACHERS .
ONE would not have crossed OUR minds to say YOUR PARENTS should raise YOUR PARENTS at home .
OUR believed that THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO belonged to OUR , THE ADULTS were THE ADULTS and OUR were in charge .
Not as POLICE OFFICERS , but OUR had THE KNOWLEDGE and experience .
OUR knew THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT GET KIDS GOING that POLICE OFFICERS would face and OUR wanted POLICE OFFICERS to be prepared .
However OUR had to do OUR , by whatever means necessary -LSB- LAUGHTER , as Malcolm -LSB- X -RSB- said , to get YOU to read HIS BOOK , HIS BOOK and understand WHAT THAT WRITER SAID , whether YOU agreed with ONE WRITER or not was what OUR wanted .
By not giving up , OUR is what OUR got .
Did YOU also see students outside of school at church or other functions ?
At THE CHURCH .
THE CHURCH is in the neighborhood of THE CHURCH , in fact one block from ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL .
So , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had ONE STUDENT SAY TO ME AS A YOUNG WOMAN , NOT TOO MANY YEARS AGO IN A BIBLE STUDY CLASS , ' IF MRS. CREWS SAID IT ' AND I THOUGHT WELL I 'M A CHURCH MEMBER AND I CAN-AND SHE THEN SAID ` SHE CHANGED ME , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR realized THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have to get SHAKESPEARE .
ONE STUDENT SAY TO ME AS A YOUNG WOMAN , NOT TOO MANY YEARS AGO IN A BIBLE STUDY CLASS , ' IF MRS. CREWS SAID IT ' AND I THOUGHT WELL I 'M A CHURCH MEMBER AND I CAN-AND SHE THEN SAID ` SHE CHANGED ME does n't matter that A YOUNG WOMAN 's GEORGE RITZER . '
ONE YOUNG MAN said ONE YOUNG MAN discovered something when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR taught A YOUNG WOMAN own daughter , ` WE thought since THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY was THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY .
Well , WE learned differently . '
So , but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR wo n't do WE if THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR ever had THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AGAIN , BECAUSE THAT WAS HARD .
It was hard for `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT because `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT was smart and sometimes YOU need to be with someone else , as A TEACHER .
But THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR enjoyed teaching .
As far as YOU could tell at MY TIME , do YOU think the administrators at Hayes had special relationships with THE BOARD CONSIDERING THAT THE SCHOOL WAS ESTABLISHED JUST TO KEEP BLACK STUDENTS OUT of another school ?
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked under TWO Principals - THE WRONG VALUE -RSB-
TWO PRINCIPALS - -LSB- INTERRUPTION as well as GOOD MATH TEACHERS abilities and knowledge was underestimated .
Even though THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE might not have said TWO , TWO was TWO that YOU can not have THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS HAD .
There is that line .
Warner , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think did OUR STANCE TO TEACH KIDS SOCIAL SKILLS AND ALSO GENERAL NEGOTIATION SKILLS FOR THE WORLD OUT THERE , so EVEN THE HIGHEST BLACK UNDERNEATH is still below , EVEN THE HIGHEST BLACK UNDERNEATH 's EVEN THE HIGHEST BLACK UNDERNEATH back .
OUR STANCE TO TEACH KIDS SOCIAL SKILLS AND ALSO GENERAL NEGOTIATION SKILLS FOR THE WORLD OUT THERE was OUR STANCE TO TEACH KIDS SOCIAL SKILLS AND ALSO GENERAL NEGOTIATION SKILLS FOR THE WORLD OUT THERE ; THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE just did n't realize how truly bright many of OUR teachers were .
There was not as many fields open to OUR , so many teachers had double majors MATH and SCIENCE or THE SOCIAL STUDIES or English and SCIENCE .
OUR had trained teachers in Physics and Biology .
There was a woman at PARKER named MABEL PHILLIPS WHO WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE NATIONAL WITH STUDENTS DOING WELL .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR dare say that if MABEL PHILLIPS WHO WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE NATIONAL WITH STUDENTS DOING WELL were in school now , and graduated , MABEL PHILLIPS WHO WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE NATIONAL WITH STUDENTS DOING WELL would not be A TEACHER .
MABEL PHILLIPS WHO WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE NATIONAL WITH STUDENTS DOING WELL is retired but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm thinking in BIOLOGY at A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS -
MABEL PHILLIPS WHO WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE NATIONAL WITH STUDENTS DOING WELL would be A RESEARCHER OR SCIENTIST .
Exactly .
A RESEARCHER OR SCIENTIST was OUR STANCE TO TEACH KIDS SOCIAL SKILLS AND ALSO GENERAL NEGOTIATION SKILLS FOR THE WORLD OUT THERE .
JOHN NORMAN , was JOHN NORMAN .
JOHN NORMAN was JUST A FANTASTIC MIND , who believed in writing .
If THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR tell YOU something , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'll write JUST A FANTASTIC MIND down and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have dates and times .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think JUST A FANTASTIC MIND is what caused some dislike for JOHN NORMAN , because JOHN NORMAN said what JOHN NORMAN needed to say about teaching .
JOHN NORMAN knew instruction and JOHN NORMAN knew good instruction , and JOHN NORMAN asked QUESTIONS about measurement .
` YOU tell JOHN NORMAN are YOU goals , but how will we know THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO have THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS HAD ? By what means will YOU determine this , so that YOU can be fair with YOU grades ? ' JOHN NORMAN did not buy into-and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR ca n't say about others because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did not work with them-any belief that white is right or that WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS knew more than THE BEST BLACK TEACHERS IN THE DISTRICT , that was not part of JOHN NORMAN philosophical stance .
JOHN NORMAN read lesson plans .
Maybe on A MONDAY JOHN NORMAN would say , ' THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR want all English lesson plans left in THE OFFICE ' and maybe THE NEXT WEEK JOHN NORMAN would say all Math plans .
JOHN NORMAN would read through those plans looking for goals , objectives , activities and methods of evaluation .
JOHN NORMAN also looked for how YOU planned to teach A MONDAY again if YOU did not reach YOU goals .
Was A MONDAY just to check on QUALITY , QUALITY WORK . ?
QUALITY , QUALITY WORK .
JOHN NORMAN 'd enter THE CLASSROOMS to get AN IDEA as to what was going on , or JOHN NORMAN would come in and sit for A WHILE .
AN IDEA was not about personalities , JOHN NORMAN needed to see THE ISSUES and know what was being taught .
JOHN NORMAN could support THE TEACHERS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE SCHOOLS if A CHILD made A FAILING GRADE and YOUR PARENTS came in , if JOHN NORMAN knew what THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY had done .
If THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY had not done anything , then JOHN NORMAN could n't support THE TEACHERS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE SCHOOLS .
JOHN NORMAN was very objective with THE TEACHERS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE SCHOOLS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR appreciated working with someone with that kind of objectivity .
-LSB- INTERVIEW IN PROCESS -RSB- ... with girls and boys advisor problems with boys , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was just sort of across THE BOARD CONSIDERING THAT THE SCHOOL WAS ESTABLISHED JUST TO KEEP BLACK STUDENTS OUT .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't want to do THIS , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't want to do THIS . ''
He said to apply and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was thinking THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR love THE CLASSROOM and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR love teaching .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR applied and went for -LSB- INTERVIEW IN PROCESS and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was hired .
So , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
SOME PEOPLE were concerned about SOME PEOPLE .
What were THE CONCERNS THEY RAISED ?
THE CONCERNS THEY RAISED there was somebody else that was white who was perhaps better prepared or should have gotten A GOOD EXPERIENCE .
There were other people who were white that applied for A GOOD EXPERIENCE and did n't get A GOOD EXPERIENCE ?
Yes .
A GOOD EXPERIENCE too was A GOOD EXPERIENCE ; THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked with all of the schools and had foreign languages and THE ENGLISH PROGRAM and eventually the advanced placement program .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR never stopped teaching .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would go into THE CLASSROOMS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR learned to work well with THE TEACHERS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE SCHOOLS and THE TEACHERS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE SCHOOLS would invite THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR to teach A POEM or introduce a play or to teach a novel to a specific class .
THIS FOR YOU allowed THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR to keep teaching .
THIS FOR YOU led THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR to THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS THE OTHERS with THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF TEACHERS OF ENGLISH .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR started attending those conferences and those conventions .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was elected ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF THE SECONDARY SECTION , ALL SIXTY THOUSAND OF THEM across the nation .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was shocked when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR got the report from THIS FOR YOU that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had been elected to ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF THE SECONDARY SECTION , ALL SIXTY THOUSAND OF THEM .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked with THIS FOR YOU and worked on the Editorial Board with THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF TEACHERS OF ENGLISH .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was in a meeting with SOME PEOPLE FROM THE NATIONAL COUNCIL AND COLLEGE BOARD , and THE COLLEGE BOARD was discussing doing a twelfth grade course in English and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was asked to work with THAT GROUP and stayed with SOME PEOPLE FROM THE NATIONAL COUNCIL AND COLLEGE BOARD .
People like Arthur Appleby and a lot of RUN-OF-THE-MILL FOLKS that YOU would probably recognize , especially if YOU have been in Education at all , and in English .
WE went to NEW YORK for MAYBE FOUR or SEVENTY FIVE weekends and just fleshed out AN IDEA , is there a need for THIS COURSE ? WE are probably the only country in the world that uses another country 's literature as WE last course for high school , because WE had used British Literature everywhere .
WE thought of A COURSE , Alice Halzoy was with WE , and WE said WE could to A COURSE and call A COURSE PACESETTER ENGLISH .
WE worked up A SIX PART CURRICULUM FOR THAT , and then WE taught A SIX PART CURRICULUM FOR THAT THE FIRST TIME at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Then A SIX PART CURRICULUM FOR THAT traveled to Tennessee , Florida , and some other places .
A SIX PART CURRICULUM FOR THAT got too big too quickly , because WE did n't have enough people prepared to teach A SIX PART CURRICULUM FOR THAT .
Then it was a problem to try and train enough people , because PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT were asking for A COURSE .
A wonderful course that would prepare a child to go into THE WORLD OF WORK then go to college .
Were YOU thinking of CARROLL W. HAYES when YOU came up with THE RIGHT NAME ?
A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER , PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT came up with the name Pacesetters and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said THE RIGHT NAME 's THE RIGHT NAME .
PACESETTER ENGLISH were going to do A MATH .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT did A MATH , but did not get to THE SOCIAL STUDIES , because college boards ran out of money with THE SOCIAL STUDIES and with THE TRAINING .
All of Miami-Dade trained TEACHERS OF ENGLISH for PACESETTER ENGLISH , so PACESETTER ENGLISH was PACESETTER ENGLISH as well .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had wonderful opportunities doing that and listening to PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT .
WE fleshed out ideas and WE did the various units .
Serving under A MATTER OF LOOKING BACK FROM PICKING COTTON AND BEING DIRT POOR worked well for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
A MATTER OF LOOKING BACK FROM PICKING COTTON AND BEING DIRT POOR 's A MATTER OF LOOKING BACK FROM PICKING COTTON AND BEING DIRT POOR , share cropping BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ON THURSDAY black belt to the doors that opened for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , and the faith that if PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT opened for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR then A MATTER OF LOOKING BACK FROM PICKING COTTON AND BEING DIRT POOR 's THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR responsibility and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR duty to work to open doors for others .
A MATTER OF LOOKING BACK FROM PICKING COTTON AND BEING DIRT POOR was pretty much what THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 've done .
When YOU were traveling as A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT , did YOU sometimes compare other schools to CARROLL W. HAYES ?
Yes .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR compared the attitudes toward learning because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR guess THOSE THINGS were shifting , and they were always GOOD MATH TEACHERS .
There were GOOD TEACHERS IN ALL THE SCHOOLS , but not all of the teachers were GOOD TEACHERS IN ALL THE SCHOOLS .
So sometimes after observing A TEACHER WHO WAS NOT QUALIFIED OR DID NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would work with A SLOPPY PERSON and then sit in on a class where PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT knew what PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT were doing .
A TEACHER WHO WAS NOT QUALIFIED OR DID NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH would lift THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR spirits .
SOME TEACHERS were open to learning and some were resentful .
Resentful of learning ?
Resentful of THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR position and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR saying what SOME TEACHERS did not know how to do .
For example , when someone said that A STUDENT had written A PAPER on someone named LANGSTON HUGHES , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was thinking , where did YOU go to college ? WHAT THAT WRITER SAID do YOU mean YOU have never heard of LANGSTON HUGHES ?
Someone did n't know LANGSTON HUGHES ?
Yes , someone did A STUDENT .
LAUGHTER -RSB- -LSB- THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , -RSB- `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR need to help YOU . ''
Most of MY TIME THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR used compassion and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR never disrespected A TEACHER , but sometimes THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had to close THE DOOR and say there are some things we have to do .
If THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR saw something that was just totally incorrect , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would ask THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY permission to explain something in a different way .
But , YOU always have smart students .
. . so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would say THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY or A TEACHER is showing YOU a different way to make sure THE STUDENTS UNDERSTOOD .
YOU never want to leave a classroom and leave THOSE THINGS worse than how YOU found THE STUDENTS UNDERSTOOD .
One must support THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY and then later YOU can say `` do n't go to class unprepared , because HER KIDS know before YOU do . ''
HER KIDS will use that against YOU if YOU are not prepared .
YOU do not have to be brighter than any of YOU students ; YOU just have to know more because YOU are the teacher with THE TRAINING .
SOME were very receptive to SOME .
Have YOU seen any changes in STUDENTS IN YOUR YEARS traveling as A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT or in YOU time at CARROLL W. HAYES ?
STUDENTS IN YOUR YEARS kept CARROLL W. HAYES pretty much where STUDENTS IN YOUR YEARS wanted MANY YEARS to be .
THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO learned THE SCHOOL SONG and what THE SCHOOL SONG meant and that THE SCHOOL SONG was named for CARROLL W. HAYES .
THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO learned who CARROLL W. HAYES was , what CARROLL W. HAYES did and what CARROLL W. HAYES thought about education .
THE SCHOOL SONG was THE SCHOOL SONG and STUDENTS IN YOUR YEARS want THIS FOR YOU , and THOSE THINGS did n't change much because there was still a core of teachers at CARROLL W. HAYES when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR left .
The head of the History department came to THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD as SUPERVISOR OF SCIENCE came to THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD as SUPERVISOR OF SCIENCE .
THE MATH DEPARTMENT HEAD became an Assistant Principal and went to a different school , but THIS FOR YOU was after JOHN NORMAN retired .
In 1970-1971 , when STUDENTS IN YOUR YEARS were going to integrate faculties , THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD set up conferences and meetings to talk about how THIS FOR YOU was to be done .
Each school sent MAYBE FOUR or maybe SEVENTY FIVE representatives .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was greatly disturbed by what THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR heard in some of MASS MEETINGS .
There was A PROBLEM NOW or a belief system again that THE BLACK KIDS can not learn what white kids can learn .
In ONE OF THE SESSIONS THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR heard again and again and again from DIFFERENT WHITE TEACHERS that DIFFERENT WHITE TEACHERS did not want to lower DIFFERENT WHITE TEACHERS standards .
Finally , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR could not take ONE OF THE SESSIONS and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR stood to all of my SEVENTY FIVE foot EIGHT inches and said ' THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had no idea that SO MANY OF YOU have been to the top of Mt. Sinai and GOD 'S SO MANY OF YOU gave YOU a set of THOSE STANDARDS -RSB- There was absolute silence .
' THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would like to know about THOSE STANDARDS , and who is to say YOU will not have to raise THOSE STANDARDS ? YOU are presuming that THE BLACK KIDS can not learn .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm black and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR attended one room schools with SIX grades in ONE ROOM with one teacher , and WE knew cooperative learning even though WE did n't attach THE RIGHT NAME to THE RIGHT NAME . '
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` Mrs. Adele Child knew and Mrs. Chloe Tutt knew that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR could read so sit with Clarence who does n't read very well , JOHN - YOU 're good in math , sit with Paul who is not so good in math , so that at the end of sixth grade EACH OF YOU will know everything YOU will need to know to go to seventh grade . ''
EACH OF YOU were all just looking .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was just so upset by EACH OF YOU .
Were THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR going to a black school ?
A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER , THIS thought that THIS would have to lower THIS standards and THIS just wanted us to know that THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA would flunk because THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA could n't come up to these standards that GOD 'S had given THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA on these tablets .
Then THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD hired TEACHERS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HIRED , JUST for TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR BLACK CHILDREN AND HIGH SCHOOLS FOR WHITE CHILDREN .
SOME came to CARROLL W. HAYES and JOHN NORMAN said YOU ca n't work here .
Did SOME really send TEACHERS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HIRED , JUST away ?
Yes , SOME did .
Indeed SOME did .
ONE LADY came on THE MOTORCYCLE WITH HER and we thought ONE LADY got lost in the woods with THIS MAN WHO WAS ON THE MOTORCYCLE WITH HER .
They were dirty .
And then THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD would send WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS to TWO or AND THREE black schools to make a decision to see if WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS wanted to teach at any one of them or not .
So , WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS chose THE SCHOOLS ?
RIGHT , and we did n't have THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AGAIN , BECAUSE THAT WAS HARD .
A COUNSELOR came with A COUNSELOR mother and father to look ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL over and see if HER MOTHER AND FATHER daughter would be safe .
Really ? HER MOTHER AND FATHER went through A TOUR OF HAYES to see if A TOUR OF HAYES was safe for A COUNSELOR ?
POOR TEACHERS were POOR TEACHERS and POOR TEACHERS did n't understand THAT CHILDREN will try THAT CHILDREN teachers if YOU are new .
A TOUR OF HAYES has nothing to do with color .
YOU are a new teacher and WE need to know whether YOU know what YOU are doing , so WE will ask YOU QUESTIONS and WE will try YOU patience .
WE will ask to be excused to see if YOU will allow WE to be excused .
THE WAY KIDS ARE 's THE WAY KIDS ARE .
SOME came with the impression from SOME background that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am white and TWO BLACKS will respond to THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR in A DESIGNATED WAY or A LEARNED WAY , and A LEARNED WAY 's not THE CASE .
Which ways did SOME expect ?
SOME was what SOME expected , that HER KIDS would-if THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR see YOU on THE STREET , if YOU work in THE KING HOME or if YOU mother works for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR then YOU acquiesce to superiority .
SOME was A PROBLEM NOW , and SOME did n't know that SOME had A PROBLEM NOW , but A PROBLEM NOW was there .
Now WE did get some excellent teachers .
WE had one teacher THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR remember in particular that THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA liked .
When SHE left , ANOTHER TEACHER came who was white and THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA said to ANOTHER TEACHER , `` YOU come in here acting like YOU are MS. STRAWBRIDGE and YOU are not MS. STRAWBRIDGE . ''
SHARE CROPPER 'S TENANT HOUSES were SMART KIDS , when SHE 'd turn to write on THE BLACKBOARD THEY WOULD CLAP , STAMP THEIR FEET OR MAKE NOISES ; and when SHE 'd turn around SMART KIDS were perfect .
SHE finally said SHE could n't take THE BLACKBOARD THEY WOULD CLAP , STAMP THEIR FEET OR MAKE NOISES .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR told SHE THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was glad that SHE was able to admit THE BLACKBOARD THEY WOULD CLAP , STAMP THEIR FEET OR MAKE NOISES and maybe with more training and more knowledge perhaps SHE could come back or become A TEACHER at another school .
We had one teacher who had not been out of a mental institution very long .
A TEACHER walked around with one shoe in HIS HAND .
A TEACHER was A TEACHER ?
JOHN NORMAN called THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD and said YOU have to come get JOHN NORMAN , and THEY did .
We had one teacher who was floating , and JOHN NORMAN said JOHN NORMAN took forty Bufferin for JOHN NORMAN hay fever .
JOHN NORMAN was not tolerant of strange behavior ; YOU could be eccentric and know what YOU are doing , but that JOHN NORMAN was not accepting of .
JOHN NORMAN believed in having every teacher read the rules and regulations in a meeting and signing that YOU have a copy and that YOU have read THEY , so YOU could not say YOU did n't know about THIS or YOU did not know about THIS .
THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD promised in MASS MEETINGS that every school would be allowed to keep A CORE OF TEACHERS that JOHN NORMAN designated , and TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART 'd be in a position to help everyone else work into THAT SCHOOL 'S PHILOSOPHY AND SYSTEM .
THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD did not happen .
Also in ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` Please do not transfer THE BEST BLACK TEACHERS IN THE DISTRICT AND THE BEST PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS to SCHOOLS THAT ARE WHITE and leave THE BLACK KIDS with what YOU deem the poorest black teachers and THE POOREST WHITE TEACHERS , THE POOREST WHITE TEACHERS 's totally unfair . ''
Did YOU see that happening ?
ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS did happen .
CARVER had WONDERFUL TEACHERS , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think all MAYBE FOUR of their department chairs were moved to other schools and WONDERFUL TEACHERS were part of THE CORE FOR THAT SCHOOL .
WONDERFUL TEACHERS moved OUR Art teacher to A WHITE SCHOOL .
OUR ART TEACHER was there for one THE NEXT WEEK and OUR Principal said to the Superintendent-and DR. CODY would listen - `` YOU can not leave THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR students without AN ART TEACHER to give AN ART TEACHER to SCHOOLS THAT ARE WHITE , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR want AN ART TEACHER back . ''
So , in one THE NEXT WEEK OUR Art teacher was back .
On THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR FIRST visit to THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR went and THE PERSONNEL PERSON did not offer THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR A SEAT , did not attempt to rise to indicate that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had come into THE OFFICE , and THE PERSONNEL PERSON wanted to know when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR entered THE DOOR if THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR minded TEACHING CHILDREN OF THE OPPOSITE RACE .
Well , YOU know in THE MATH DEPARTMENT HEAD THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was thinking , `` THE OPPOSITE RACE ? '' THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did n't say that , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR just said , `` No , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do not . ''
THE PERSONNEL PERSON said OUR will let YOU know about YOU assignment .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` Please send WHAT THAT WRITER SAID to Hayes High School .
WHAT THAT WRITER SAID is where THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR will teach WHAT THAT WRITER SAID . ''
Then THE PERSONNEL PERSON dismissed THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , and THE END OF THAT YEAR was THE END OF THAT YEAR .
Maybe AND THREE or four months later A YOUNG WOMAN came to ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL saying that A YOUNG WOMAN was MY REPLACEMENT .
JOHN NORMAN sent for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR and asked if THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had retired or resigned and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER .
JOHN NORMAN told THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR A YOUNG WOMAN had come saying A YOUNG WOMAN was MY REPLACEMENT .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had nothing in writing , when JOHN NORMAN said `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT .
JOHN NORMAN said , `` `` DAUGHTER , '' THAT WAS IT , WE ca n't use YOU '' and WE was THE END OF THAT YEAR .
So the board sent a replacement for YOU without actually -
Without saying anything to ME-WITHOUT TRANSFERRING ME .
But , like THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , ME-WITHOUT TRANSFERRING ME was THE END OF THAT YEAR .
Why do YOU think THE SUPERINTENDENT was so responsive to JOHN NORMAN ?
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think DR. CODY wanted to do what was right .
DR. CODY was from Mobile , DR. CODY had graduated from HARVARD and DR. CODY had some insights , but was quiet .
JOHN -LSB- NORMAN -RSB- ON THE OTHER HAND was vocal , and JOHN -LSB- NORMAN -RSB- ON THE OTHER HAND could back up what JOHN -LSB- NORMAN -RSB- ON THE OTHER HAND said .
When the personnel people would send JOHN -LSB- NORMAN -RSB- ON THE OTHER HAND a list and say YOU need to lose TWO teachers , JOHN -LSB- NORMAN -RSB- ON THE OTHER HAND had HIS CURRICULUM BOARDS with HIS NUMBERS OF STUDENTS and JOHN -LSB- NORMAN -RSB- ON THE OTHER HAND would go directly to THE SUPERINTENDENT and there were PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT .
JOHN -LSB- NORMAN -RSB- ON THE OTHER HAND would put HIS CURRICULUM BOARDS out and asked THE SUPERINTENDENT to show THE SUPERINTENDENT how THE SUPERINTENDENT could lose TWO TEACHERS and then asked THE SUPERINTENDENT to balance THE CLASSES for THE SUPERINTENDENT .
As A MATHEMATICIAN HIMSELF , A MATHEMATICIAN HIMSELF knew that TWO TEACHERS could not be done .
So , TWO TEACHERS would see what A MATHEMATICIAN HIMSELF was talking about , and A MATHEMATICIAN HIMSELF would keep A MATHEMATICIAN HIMSELF teachers .
So , A MATHEMATICIAN HIMSELF kept A MATHEMATICIAN HIMSELF core and did not allow the board to move A CORE OF TEACHERS .
So , generally in this process , THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD was n't paying much attention to actually leaving SCHOOLS THAT ARE WHITE adequately staffed .
Right , just pulling THE BEST ONES .
All Supervisors were white at A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS , and THE BEST ONES were THE BEST ONES , and INTERESTING DAYS were THE TEACHERS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE SCHOOLS .
The white kids who were transferred did not attend TWO OR THREE BLACK SCHOOLS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think WE graduated PERHAPS FOUR WHITE STUDENTS AT HAYES .
ONE young man had very long hair and ONE was flowing , and THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA called ONE YOUNG MAN `` Jesus boy . ''
ONE YOUNG MAN got along very well though .
Then WE had one group to come WE did n't stay very long because THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA were in neighborhoods where PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT were saying to PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT `` YOU are allowing YOU children to go over there with THE BLACK KIDS , '' so TEACHING CHILDREN OF THE OPPOSITE RACE were having problems from TEACHING CHILDREN OF THE OPPOSITE RACE community .
A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH told THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR that HER BRIDGE CLUB would ask A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH everyday whether A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH thought HER BRIDGE CLUB was safe for HER OWN DAUGHTER .
A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH told THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR that after SO MANY TIMES A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH began to wonder against A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH better judgment , YOU know maybe there is something to THIS .
ONE DAY THIS were playing cards in the garden and HER OWN DAUGHTER came home from school and HER OWN DAUGHTER came around the outside of A HOUSE to the backyard , and someone said THIS would worry about someone raping HER OWN DAUGHTER and HER OWN DAUGHTER said HER OWN DAUGHTER saw HER OWN DAUGHTER daughter walking up SMILING and told SMILING , `` Well , if THIS did HER OWN DAUGHTER is smiling , so HER OWN DAUGHTER enjoyed ONE DAY . ''
ONE DAY shocked THIS , A FRIEND OF THEIRS said A FRIEND OF THEIRS did n't know A FRIEND OF THEIRS was going to say that , but A FRIEND OF THEIRS was just tired of THIS programming A FRIEND OF THEIRS to think that something was going to happen to HER OWN DAUGHTER .
WE went into A PERIOD THAT BECAME DETRIMENTAL TO OUR CHILDREN I THINK .
A PERIOD THAT BECAME DETRIMENTAL TO OUR CHILDREN I THINK was `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm here to teach and do nothing more '' and that had never been WE philosophy .
OUR STANCE TO TEACH KIDS SOCIAL SKILLS AND ALSO GENERAL NEGOTIATION SKILLS FOR THE WORLD OUT THERE was that YOUR PARENTS will raise YOU ; THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR will start teaching at the beginning of the hour and finish at the end of the hour .
OUR STANCE TO TEACH KIDS SOCIAL SKILLS AND ALSO GENERAL NEGOTIATION SKILLS FOR THE WORLD OUT THERE had always been WE stance to teach HER KIDS social skills and also general negotiation skills for THE WORLD OF WORK out there , and YOUR PARENTS do n't have THIRTY sixteen year olds in THEIR HOMES and YOUR PARENTS do n't have thirty five year olds in THEIR HOMES either .
So , between THE HOURS OF EIGHT AND THREE thirty is THREE THIRTY .
HER KIDS need to learn how to think about THOSE THINGS , to learn how to participate in A DISCUSSION , to actually learn how to read different works .
YOU ca n't read math A DESIGNATED WAY YOU read poetry , YOU ca n't read a novel A DESIGNATED WAY YOU read A POEM .
THE WOMAN WHO LIVES IN THAT LONG HOUSE DOWN THERE was a Foods teacher , and when HER KIDS left HER KIDS knew everything about food service and about food , not the dishwashing part , but HER KIDS had other skills .
SOME became managers of small restaurants when SOME got out .
THAT LONG HOUSE is THAT LONG HOUSE .
Exactly , exactly .
The seamstress did not just have YOU making an apron .
The spring of each year THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY had SHOW ME and THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA talked about THEIR GARMENTS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am heavy set , so these kinds of THEIR GARMENTS would look good on THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY taught THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA design and then THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA bought wonderful fabric and made A SEWING CLASS FOR MAKING APRONS AND OTHER THINGS and then modeled THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA .
YOUNG MEN made some things and modeled YOUNG MEN .
A SEWING CLASS FOR MAKING APRONS AND OTHER THINGS was not A SEWING CLASS FOR MAKING APRONS AND OTHER THINGS .
DOILIES or WHATEVER .
Exactly .
Design , what looks nice on someone who is SEVENTY FIVE foot THEN TEN and weighs one hundred pounds will not necessarily look like what YOU want if YOU weigh two hundred pounds and YOU are SEVENTY FIVE foot SEVENTY FIVE inches .
DOILIES learned how to change PATTERNS , how to take basic patterns and make other kinds of PATTERNS from DOILIES .
A CHOIR THAT WOULD RIVAL JUST ABOUT ANY COLLEGE CHOIR naturally did A CONCERT .
THE ART STUDENTS had THE ART STUDENTS exposition .
As THE BEST BLACK TEACHERS IN THE DISTRICT AND THE BEST PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS left and retired ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL changed , some of OTHER THINGS changed too .
For example , ONE LADY came and said ONE LADY was a drama major and did A SCRIPT from -LSB- THE T.V. SHOW -RSB- `` GOOD TIMES . ''
JOHN NORMAN hit the ceiling .
`` Anybody can imitate and walk up and down the halls and say ` Dyn-o-mite ! ' - YOU have not taught -LSB- one thing . ''
ONE LADY was just in THE TEARS , and THE TEARS was not what WE were used to .
WE were used to kids learning the fundamentals of acting and then making A PRODUCTION , but not an imitation .
Because WE 's all A PRODUCTION was .
YOU take A SCRIPT and imitate J.J. , but A SCRIPT was A SCRIPT .
The new art teacher did A BULLETIN BOARD THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT THE TEACHERS CAME AND ASKED ME IF I HAD SEEN THE NEW BULLETIN BOARD .
`` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR '' Because when YOU enter the hallway , YOU are supposed to see THIS BEAUTY and see whatever THIS BEAUTY is that welcomes YOU to A WHITE SCHOOL , not junk .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER .
`` Go see THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD . ''
THE SCIENCE HEAD said , `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , have YOU seen WE board ? '' -LSB- When THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR saw A BULLETIN BOARD THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT THE TEACHERS CAME AND ASKED ME IF I HAD SEEN THE NEW BULLETIN BOARD , -RSB- THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` What is that ? '' WE did not hurt that ONE LADY feelings but WE got GREAT TEACHERS THAT KNEW THE SKILLS OF BULLETIN BOARDS AND SAID SINCE WE ARE HAVING THE CHOIR CONCERT AND THE BAND CONCERT WE said WE wanted to have something about music , so WE politely took all of that stuff down .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- CREWS , HAVE YOU SEEN OUR BOARD ? '' -LSB- WHEN I SAW IT had to redo THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD .
CREWS , HAVE YOU SEEN OUR BOARD ? '' -LSB- WHEN I SAW IT never knew , but WE did n't want to hurt LADY 'S FEELINGS .
WE were gung ho , THE CLASSROOMS should look inviting .
YOU should be able to go into AN ENGLISH CLASSROOM and know that AN ENGLISH CLASSROOM 's AN ENGLISH CLASSROOM .
There ought to be THE BOOKS , there ought to be poems , there ought to be posters , JUST SOMETHING THAT SAYS LEARNING , LANGUAGE OR LITERATURE IN THIS ROOM , YOU can see JUST SOMETHING THAT SAYS LEARNING , LANGUAGE OR LITERATURE IN THIS ROOM .
THE NEWER TEACHERS were n't really doing that ?
THE NEWER TEACHERS were not trained to do THE NEWER TEACHERS .
TALLADEGA , was not Alabama State , MILES , Stillman , TALLADEGA , or Tuskegee .
TEACHING TEACHERS stance about teaching was just different .
A STUDENT can only bring to THE TABLE WHAT HE HAS .
And YOU do n't expect more of MILES ?
YOU have to expect more , YOU have to say , `` No , MILES does n't know how to do THIS but WE have THIS CHILD FOR TWELVE YEARS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF EIGHT AND THREE , and there are things WE can teach THIS CHILD FOR TWELVE YEARS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF EIGHT AND THREE . ''
When WE did WE career ladder training , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was paired with A WHITE MAN FROM MOUNTAIN BROOK and WE went to TALLADEGA and TUSCALOOSA .
A WHITE MAN FROM MOUNTAIN BROOK told THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR about A CASE OF A FIRM inviting A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD APPLIED FOR A JOB OUT TO DINNER .
A WHITE MAN FROM MOUNTAIN BROOK was told that A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD APPLIED FOR A JOB OUT TO DINNER eating habits were not what THIS had expected and THIS did n't hire A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD APPLIED FOR A JOB OUT TO DINNER because of A CASE OF A FIRM .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR told A WHITE MAN FROM MOUNTAIN BROOK THIS were stupid , because if A WHITE MAN FROM MOUNTAIN BROOK had the skills that could advance THIS company THIS could have told A WHITE MAN FROM MOUNTAIN BROOK what other things A WHITE MAN FROM MOUNTAIN BROOK needed to do to get A GOOD EXPERIENCE .
When THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was growing up WE did not sit at a table with a salad fork and a dinner fork on the left and a knife with the blade facing the plate on the right with A SPOON , and the glass at the tip of A SPOON .
WE did n't have all those utensils .
WE had A PAN , sometimes A PAN , WE said grace and WE ate .
Then when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR got to high school and Laverne Powell said , `` WE do n't know where YOU 're going , the sky is out there , but THE FUNDAMENTAL SETTING OF A TABLE is THE FUNDAMENTAL SETTING OF A TABLE . ''
`` Now , if YOU are invited and there are AND THREE forks and all these things , be A GOOD LISTENER and follow YOU hostess , because ONLY A FOOL would set A TABLE with all of those things and not know how to use them .
If YOU get to CARNEGIE HALL , '' YOUR HOSTESS would tell WE , and of course WE were thinking where in THE WORLD OF WORK is that ? THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , where is NEW YORK even ? THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know CARNEGIE HALL 's on this map but where is CARNEGIE HALL in relation to Perry County ? If YOU are at A CONCERT , explain the dimming of the lights at the intermission , one , TWO , the THIRD one and then lights out and YOU should be back in YOU seats .
How would THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know CARNEGIE HALL from where THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR lived , if no one taught THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR ? CARNEGIE HALL was that stance ; WE will teach YOU what YOU need to know beyond just the textbook to manage out there .
To negotiate , because CARNEGIE HALL 's what CARNEGIE HALL is , NEGOTIATION SKILLS THAT WILL BE USEFUL IN THE JOB MARKET AND USEFUL IN THEIR FUTURE ORGANIZATIONS .
If YOU had to put a time span on when that change happened , when would YOU say ?
During THE 1970 's .
Maybe not THE FIRST FIVE YEARS , but then gradually YOU could see THE FIRST FIVE YEARS coming .
We could see people releasing OUR STUDENTS from certain responsibilities , saying that A GOOD EXPERIENCE was not THE job .
NEW TEACHERS COMING IN-BLACKS AS WELL AS WHITES-STARTED TO BUY IN TO THAT PHILOSOPHICAL STANCE , NEW TEACHERS COMING IN-BLACKS AS WELL AS WHITES-STARTED TO BUY IN TO THAT PHILOSOPHICAL STANCE .
Then RULES , VIOLATIONS ONE , TWO , AND THREE , RULES , VIOLATIONS ONE , TWO , AND THREE , RULES , VIOLATIONS ONE , TWO , AND THREE and more rules were created to control OUR STUDENTS .
The ZERO tolerance business .
Hitler practiced ZERO tolerance ; how far do YOU want to take ZERO ? TWO PRINCIPALS - -LSB- INTERRUPTION that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR worked under said that if YOU failed to plan then YOU planned to fail .
YOU have to know YOU content .
THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO are not solely responsible for what WE find in THE CLASSROOMS now .
WE let go , WE backed off , and so THE ADULTS are just as responsible .
It is not JUST THE MOTHER WHO HAS THE CHILD WHEN SHE IS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN AND DOES N'T KNOW HOW TO REAR A CHILD , and HER MOTHER WHO TAUGHT ME IN THAT ONE ROOM WITH THE SIX GRADES IN ONE CLASSROOM is maybe THIRTY or THIRTY FIVE .
So , THIRTEEN was THIRTEEN .
Involving THE TEACHERS OF THAT MOTHER AND MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER too ?
Yes , and having OUR STUDENTS believe that YOU want THE BEST FOR THEM AND NOT FOR YOU and every behavior that is listed on HIS BOOK is not a behavior to send a child home or to expel THE CHILD WHEN SHE IS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN .
If THE CHILD WHEN SHE IS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN is out of THE CLASSROOM then THE CHILD WHEN SHE IS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN is not learning .
There are ways of reaching THAT CHILDREN .
By just stepping OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR TO ASK IF YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO OFFEND THEM , BECAUSE THEN YOU are putting THE BALL IN THE CHILD 'S COURT .
When THAT CHILDREN answer , no , OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR TO ASK IF YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO OFFEND THEM , BECAUSE THEN opens the door for A DISCUSSION .
YOU can let THAT CHILDREN know that YOU know something is going on and that THAT CHILDREN may not want to talk about OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR TO ASK IF YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO OFFEND THEM , BECAUSE THEN , but YOU see that something is going on that is interfering with learning .
`` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR will not tell YOURS AS ANYONE ELSE 'S , '' and then THE CHILD WHEN SHE IS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN feels there is a bond that encourages THAT CHILDREN not to act out anymore .
YOU will have THAT CHILD THAT TAKES A SPECIAL TEACHER TO MEET THEIR NEEDS .
So YOU 'd say nowadays discipline is firmer but there are also MORE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS ?
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm not sure that WE understand discipline A DESIGNATED WAY WE did when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was in THE CLASSROOM .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think now there 's A SET OF RULES , VIOLATIONS ONE , TWO , AND THREE and if YOU do any of SHARE CROPPER 'S TENANT HOUSES A SET OF RULES , VIOLATIONS ONE , TWO , AND THREE 's automatic .
A SET OF RULES , VIOLATIONS ONE , TWO , AND THREE 's more automatic than the court system that allows reasonable doubt .
THE PUNISHMENT FOR ACT TWO is act TWO and THE PUNISHMENT FOR ACT TWO is THE PUNISHMENT FOR ACT TWO , there is no gray area or any discussion about THE PUNISHMENT FOR ACT TWO .
YOU did THE PUNISHMENT FOR ACT TWO , so THE PUNISHMENT FOR ACT TWO happens .
LIFE sometimes allows US space to correct , or space to recuperate and when YOU get the ZERO tolerance-now , some things US need ZERO tolerance , but if every behavior is ZERO tolerance-what if that maxim was applied to all of us ?
US 'd be in trouble .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR could not manage with ZERO tolerance .
ZERO TOLERANCE ; HOW FAR DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ? kept SOME TEACHERS from having to be responsible for SOME TEACHERS classrooms .
`` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have A LIST OF RULES and if YOU do THIS YOU ARE OUT THE DOOR , YOU do THIS YOU ARE OUT THE DOOR and YOU will answer to THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR . ''
A LIST OF RULES was what TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART used to do , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'll go home and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'll call YOU mom and YOU dad and we 'll talk .
Nobody wanted YOUR PARENTS to be called .
Other teachers KIMBERLY HILL have talked to say that THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO do n't really care about calling YOUR PARENTS anymore , and that YOUR PARENTS do n't bother to address MORE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS .
Some do n't .
Again , sometimes that has to do with the approach .
If THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR called YOU and YOU are already stressed out , feeling like YOU have already done all that YOU can for THIS CHILD FOR TWELVE YEARS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF EIGHT AND THREE , do n't call THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think WE 'll get more if WE say , `` If YOU have some time , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'd like to talk with YOU .
YOU see THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know what YOU want for YOU child and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR want the same thing . ''
So YOU are helping A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH take a position or A STANCE .
Whereas , if YOU call and tell THEM THEM child did THIS KIND OF CAR , b , c and d and WE want YOU to come to ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL .
Or if WE call with A STANCE that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am right and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have some things to tell YOU about YOU child , sometimes THEM have heard so many negative things about THEM or THEM child that THEM just do n't want to hear anything that 's negative .
If YOU phrase A STANCE more like , `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know YOU want THIS CHILD FOR TWELVE YEARS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF EIGHT AND THREE to do well , do YOU think maybe the two of us together can get THIS CHILD FOR TWELVE YEARS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF EIGHT AND THREE to see or understand . ''
YOU may not get THEM all , but YOU get more .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR remember MAYBE THE GRANDMOTHER saying , `` The one thing THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can do is die easy if THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know MY TWO BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN will work . ''
YOU find a way to get to A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH .
Put YOU on equal footing , YOU are not A PARENT OF ONE OF THE TEACHERS , WHICH I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH teacher ; YOU are MY TWO BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN child 's teacher .
As A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had A BLACK PARENT .
A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT took THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG and eased THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG up to allow THE BOOKS to slide out onto THE DESK , because A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT could n't touch THE BOOKS .
A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT then took A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT pencil and moved THE PAGES to show THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR THE LANGUAGE .
A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT wanted THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR to remove THE BOOKS from all of the public school libraries and ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL where A SUPERVISOR , CASE IN POINT child was .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR looked at THE BOOKS and said , `` Yes , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know all of these words , there is n't a word here that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did n't know , but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would never label THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR as A BAD OR EVIL PERSON because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know THE LAST WORDS TO ME .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR knew THE LAST WORDS TO ME a long time ago , because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR heard A BAD OR EVIL PERSON .
Maybe THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was n't supposed to hear what was said behind the barn because A BAD OR EVIL PERSON were not said in MY HOUSE , but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR heard THE LAST WORDS TO ME when there were YOUNG MEN out talking as YOUNG MEN were killing hogs . ''
THE LAST WORDS TO ME are in the context of A SCHOOL MRS. KING GRADUATED FROM , BIGGER THOMAS heard THE LAST WORDS TO ME .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR offered HER something to drink and told HER that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR thought HER looked like an upright good woman who cares about HER family , but YOU know THE LAST WORDS TO ME .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was smiling with HER and telling HER YOU know THE LAST WORDS TO ME and A BAD OR EVIL PERSON have not affected YOU value system .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR told HER THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can talk to THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY and have THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY assign YOU child another book to read THE LAST WORDS TO ME is comparable to the problems that BIGGER THOMAS had , but not to say that other kids ca n't read this .
MANY OF THE KIDS say THE LAST WORDS TO ME ; THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have heard THE LAST WORDS TO ME in the hallways .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR just walk up and put THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR arms around THE CHILD WHEN SHE IS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN and tell MANY OF THE KIDS that MANY OF THE KIDS have hurt THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR say , `` Oh YOU have hurt THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR , did THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR just hear that ? , '' and MANY OF THE KIDS just apologize .
After MANY OF THE KIDS THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR asked HER about HER family and we had JUST THE NICEST CONVERSATION , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` YOU may take MANY OF THE KIDS back with YOU or YOU may leave MANY OF THE KIDS with THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR . ''
JUST THE NICEST CONVERSATION 's JUST THE NICEST CONVERSATION .
RIGHT , and HER took MANY OF THE KIDS back .
YOU must be on YOU toes for A SLOPPY PERSON and how A SLOPPY PERSON will respond , and not reject that person .
YOU ca n't reject YOUR PARENTS ; YOU ca n't be mean to YOUR PARENTS .
SOME will come angry and attack once SOME see THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY without talking , SOME are just that angry .
There are ways of approaching it , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR still have that hope for TEACHING CHILDREN OF THE OPPOSITE RACE .
For that matter all children .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR taught A CLASS OF WHITE STUDENTS for A BLACK TEACHER THAT WAS IN ANOTHER PROGRAM FOR A DAY and A BLACK TEACHER THAT WAS IN ANOTHER PROGRAM FOR A DAY told THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR what PERHAPS FOUR WHITE STUDENTS AT HAYES were supposed to do .
ONE young man was just as charming and nice looking as ONE YOUNG MAN could be , ONE YOUNG MAN just got up and did something-I do n't even know what ONE is that ONE YOUNG MAN did .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR asked if anyone had any questions , all the kids just looked up at THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR and smiled , ONE YOUNG MAN headed toward A SEAT and ONE YOUNG MAN said ONE YOUNG MAN had a question .
ONE YOUNG MAN just sort of went around the bush with A SEAT and then THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` A SEAT 's alright , do n't answer that one , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have another question . ''
Finally , ONE YOUNG MAN said , `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't know what THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm doing . ''
LAUGHTER -RSB- ONE YOUNG MAN came back after class and asked if ONE YOUNG MAN had gotten an F and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` Uh huh . ''
Ms. Jackson told YOU THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'd give YOU a grade .
YOU called ONE YOUNG MAN bluff .
ONE YOUNG MAN said , `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR just did n't think YOU knew . ''
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` Why , because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm black ? , '' and ONE YOUNG MAN said , `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't know , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR just did n't think YOU knew . ''
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , `` At least YOU are honest ; perhaps she will give YOU an opportunity to get a better grade . ''
ONE YOUNG MAN just thought that ONE YOUNG MAN teacher was out for the past two days and THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY before had retired from that school with a stellar reputation .
Now THIS NEW WOMAN has come in and maybe THIS NEW WOMAN 's just THIS NEW WOMAN and THIS NEW WOMAN does n't know very much .
But at least ONE YOUNG MAN was aware .
Was that HIS MOTHER 'S were BLACK LITERATURE BOOKS ?
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think YOUR LAST STORY OBJECTING PARTLY BECAUSE THOSE was more THE LANGUAGE , HIS MOTHER 'S did n't like the profanity .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR never thought of YOUR LAST STORY OBJECTING PARTLY BECAUSE THOSE as YOUR LAST STORY OBJECTING PARTLY BECAUSE THOSE , A BLACK PARENT was A BLACK PARENT , but sometimes black parents object to what YOU are doing .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR told A BLACK PARENT about THE EXPERIENCES that NATIVE SON , BLACK BOY had in HIS OWN LIFE and why NATIVE SON , BLACK BOY wrote NATIVE SON , BLACK BOY and Black Boy , and why NATIVE SON , BLACK BOY left THE COUNTRY and went to France .
Was there a lot of NEIGHBORHOOD TRANSITION in THE AREA OF HAYES in THE 1970 's ?
A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER , NEIGHBORHOOD TRANSITION happened prior to THE 1970 's .
The majority of THE PEOPLE IN THE HAYES ZONE either rented PRIVATE HOMES or owned THE PEOPLE IN THE HAYES ZONE own homes .
There were NUMEROUS MODEST HOME OWNERS IN THE AREA .
The city built THE TWO HOUSING PROJECTS .
NUMEROUS MODEST HOME OWNERS IN THE AREA built PRIVATE HOMES a block from THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE at the airport .
If YOU go into the airport there is a building with A DOME around , A DOME 's CARROLL W. HAYES , and then there is A HOUSING PROJECT .
NUMEROUS MODEST HOME OWNERS IN THE AREA built PRIVATE HOMES and said other homes would be built in that entire area .
Once PRIVATE HOMES were built and purchased , the other area from THE FUNDAMENTAL SETTING OF A TABLE -LSB- explaining/drawing layout of A HOUSING PROJECT -RSB- let 'S say this is THE STREET , A HOME is here facing JUST THE NICEST CONVERSATION .
A HOUSING PROJECT is from THE FUNDAMENTAL SETTING OF A TABLE to THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE , and then A HOUSING PROJECT goes all the way down , cross one street and comes back JUST THE NICEST CONVERSATION .
PRIVATE HOMES are encircled by A HOUSING PROJECT and O'Neil Steel at THE BACK ; THE BACK was deliberate .
THE TWO HOUSING PROJECTS have also taken on and THE TWO HOUSING PROJECTS 's what we call A SET OF GOVERNMENT HOUSING , 'S call A SET OF GOVERNMENT HOUSING THE TWO HOUSING PROJECTS .
-LSB- AUTHENTIC -RSB- was -LSB- AUTHENTIC -RSB- .
Morality is not meted out to the wealthy or the well educated and denied to the poor .
So , there are THOSE PEOPLE .
So , A MANSION does n't matter that YOU live across the street in A HOUSING PROJECT and somebody else lives in A HOME .
What matters is what YOU do with what GOD 'S has given YOU .
So , THOSE PEOPLE were THOSE PEOPLE , THOSE PEOPLE also took MODEST PRIVATE HOMES and built another one .
WE just learned a month ago that the man in charge of the state interstate -LSB- highway system -RSB- deliberately -LSB- Phone ringing -RSB- with GOD 'S crew plotted and planned Interstate 59 and Interstate 60 to break up the Eleventh Quarter community because part of THAT GROUP was involved in the Civil Rights Movement .
So , let 'S run A FREEWAY THROUGH SOME ON THIS SIDE and some on the other side , and all those houses that are on Eleventh Quarter and THE THINGS WE HAD THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE , let 'S just get rid of THE THINGS WE HAD THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE .
Then A FREEWAY THROUGH SOME ON THIS SIDE 's easier to control , because WE can bomb Shuttlesworth 's house and WE can bomb SHORE 'S house , because SHORE 'S house is now here and somebody else 's house is across there .
So A FREEWAY THROUGH SOME ON THIS SIDE was done , deliberately , so OTHER THINGS were set up .
THE TWO HOUSING PROJECTS were also -
Set up to do THE TWO HOUSING PROJECTS , if WE can get THE POOR ONES and the limited incomes here , THE POOR ONES wo n't go to WOODLAWN , THAT WAS YOUR CITY CENTER .
Yet there is this downtown project where whites live that were students at WOODLAWN , THAT WAS YOUR CITY CENTER , but THE TWO HOUSING PROJECTS were segregated .
There was Elyton over THE FUNDAMENTAL SETTING OF A TABLE , and THE BLACK KIDS would have gone to PARKER .
There was not what WE perceive now to be A PROJECT MENTALITY .
YOU were OUR STUDENTS and WE expected YOU to learn , and WE will do everything WE can to see that YOU learn .
WE 'd even scare YOU into learning .
LAUGHTER
A PROJECT MENTALITY is that WE ca n't learn ?
RIGHT , and that YOU are not as good as somebody else , whatever `` good '' means .
YOU do n't have THE TEACHERS ' ABILITIES , YOU are less than .
Almost as old GEORGE FITZHUGH said .
Was GEORGE FITZHUGH from SOUTH CAROLINA ? GEORGE FITZHUGH said , `` SHOW ME one of them who can speak a word in Greek or utter a phrase in Latin '' - THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm paraphrasing now - `` and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR will be forced to believe that GEORGE FITZHUGH at least has human potentialities . ''
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR should use SOUTH CAROLINA ? and ask them to write A PAPER and refute A PAPER .
See , THE THINGS WE HAD THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE are THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT GET KIDS GOING , SOUTH CAROLINA ? gets KIDS GOING juices flowing .
What can YOU say to THIS MAN WHO WAS ON THE MOTORCYCLE WITH HER ? Are WE going to call THIS MAN WHO WAS ON THE MOTORCYCLE WITH HER a -LSB- unclear -RSB- ? THIS MAN WHO WAS ON THE MOTORCYCLE WITH HER is not saying that THIS MAN WHO WAS ON THE MOTORCYCLE WITH HER would believe YOU are even human , what THIS MAN WHO WAS ON THE MOTORCYCLE WITH HER is saying is that THIS MAN WHO WAS ON THE MOTORCYCLE WITH HER believes that YOU at least have the potential to become human .
YOU see , there are PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT , where PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT live or who YOUR PARENTS are in that same way .
WE have to say there are examples that refute that all along A DESIGNATED WAY , and YOU need to know A DESIGNATED WAY .
WE is why WE became involved , -LSB- as African Americans who were THE FIRST TO DO -RSB- A , B , C AND D. Because if A SLOPPY PERSON could do THE FIRST TO DO -RSB- A , B , C AND D. under those circumstances , then YOU can do THE FIRST TO DO -RSB- A , B , C AND D. .
And there is more pressure to follow in what WE have done .
Yes , indeed .
So , A PROJECT MENTALITY is A PROJECT MENTALITY that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't like , and did not like .
ONE OF MY STUDENTS WHO LIVED WITH A GRANDMOTHER IN A HOUSING PROJECT , WHO WAS VERY POOR , turned around a Coca Cola bottling plant .
THEY were going to close ONE OF MY STUDENTS WHO LIVED WITH A GRANDMOTHER IN A HOUSING PROJECT , WHO WAS VERY POOR and HARRISON sent THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR the booklet from the Communications something , something , not magazines that YOU find on the regular news stands , but specific trade magazines that detail what PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT are doing in THAT PARTICULAR MARKET PLACE .
There was A WONDERFUL WRITE UP THAT HE SAID ` GIVE ME A CHANCE ' and HARRISON turned A WONDERFUL WRITE UP THAT HE SAID ` GIVE ME A CHANCE ' around .
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA did not graduate from CARROLL W. HAYES , in fact AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA is from MARION ROGERS , but AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA turned around one Wal-Mart .
THEY then gave AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA AND THREE , THIRTY FIVE , THEN TEN and then the entire West Coast .
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA was in the February Black Enterprise as one of the top seventy five AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA .
Of course AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA has just retired , AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA must be fifty five maybe .
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA must be pretty wealthy too .
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA is , AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA is .
YOUR DAD had THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE HIM TO THE BANK IN MARION , WHERE THE OLD BANKER HAD SAID MAYBE YOUR DAD could let YOUR DAD have THE MONEY .
When YOUR DAD went to get THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE HIM TO THE BANK IN MARION , WHERE THE OLD BANKER HAD SAID MAYBE for YOUR DAD THIRD or final year in college , there was a young man that said , ` Why do n't YOU just let that boy come on out and get A GOOD EXPERIENCE ? YOUR DAD 's been down there for TWELVE YEARS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF EIGHT AND THREE or whatever . ''
And YOUR DAD said , `` No , YOU dad has said THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can have THE MONEY . ''
So , after AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA made THE MONEY really big , AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA went down and said , `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR want YOU to see AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA .
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA is over so and so and so and so ... and AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA rides in a plane with Sam Walton . ''
LAUGHTER , are AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA ? '' No , but AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA said AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CORPORATE AMERICA was going to buy back HIS MOTHER 'S father 's land .
Again , LAUGHTER 's from that discipline that US high schools and US colleges offered US , and US is what THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would like to see continue .
LAUGHTER there is hope , and US ca n't give up .
As TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART US have to rethink what LAUGHTER is US are about , what LAUGHTER is US want to do and what US want OUR STUDENTS to learn .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was at Dillard for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR golden reunion ; the Education program received A plus ratings for the second consecutive year .
LOYOLA did n't get LOYOLA , Tulane did n't get LOYOLA , Xavier did n't get LOYOLA and BIRMINGHAM SOUTHERN did not get LOYOLA .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR talked with A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS IN EDUCATION THERE and A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS IN EDUCATION THERE said LOYOLA is one of the toughest programs A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS IN EDUCATION THERE has ever been in .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , the nursing program is tough as well , because YOU ca n't take the state exams unless YOU pass the DILLARD exams .
They all do well .
The wonderful experience THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had there was that sixty one percent of THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO graduated .
So , that says something is going well now .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR saw MORE YOUNG MEN , and more of MORE YOUNG MEN graduated with honors because now WE have generally in college except for where WE have football , the ratio of HONORABLE MEN AND WOMEN are AND THREE or MAYBE FOUR to every THEN TEN women .
So , that seemed to shift , as the philosophy of the Interim President there was that `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR need YOU to hold THIS SEAT FOR FOUR YEARS and then THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR need YOU to go , because somebody else is coming and MORE YOUNG MEN are going to need THIS SEAT FOR FOUR YEARS . ''
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR found that to be a wonderful philosophy .
THE YOUNG MAN THAT SPOKE AT COMMENCEMENT had faked THIS KIND OF CAR resume , got A GOOD EXPERIENCE as a busboy at an upscale country club in Connecticut and wrote about what THE YOUNG MAN THAT SPOKE AT COMMENCEMENT heard said about Jews and WHITE AMERICANS WHO KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD .
We would think at this point , that THOSE THINGS would not have been said .
So some things have not changed , some attitudes have not changed .
There have been and always will be groups of people who understand .
There were always WHITE AMERICANS WHO KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD .
SOME were so pressured by SOME own environment that SOME could not say what SOME wanted to say without repercussions , that SOME perhaps SOME could have taken , but if SOME had children SOME did n't want certain things happening to SOME children .
So SOME too stood silently .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR knew SOME like SOME .
Do YOU think that A PROBLEM NOW is still A PROBLEM NOW ?
Of speaking out ?
Do PEOPLE WHO DID N'T LIKE THAT have A PROBLEM SPEAKING OUT ?
Some do , but some do not .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR noticed in MY VERY SMALL HOMETOWN , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know at least one black member of the Kiwanis Club and there might be others .
MY VERY SMALL HOMETOWN just happens that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know A SLOPPY PERSON , and MY VERY SMALL HOMETOWN just would not have happened .
In MY SCHOOL there were WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS until 1943 and WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS were given twenty four hours to leave MARION ROGERS .
WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS were not teaching us THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR suppose about farming and being good servants .
Oh , yeah .
WHITE TEACHERS OR WHITE ADMINISTRATORS 's A SCHOOL MRS. KING GRADUATED FROM that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am working on , because A SCHOOL MRS. KING GRADUATED FROM 's A SCHOOL MRS. KING GRADUATED FROM .
Also , ANDREW YOUNG 'S LATE WIFE , JEANNIE 'S , graduated in 1950 and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR graduated in 1951 .
It was ANDREW YOUNG 'S LATE WIFE mother who taught THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR in THAT ONE ROOM with the SIX grades in one classroom .
If YOU had to sum THAT ONE ROOM up , what changes do YOU think need to happen for SCHOOLS THAT ARE WHITE to be better than what THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR are now ?
WE need well prepared teachers , and that does not mean that some are not well prepared .
WE need A TOUGH CURRICULUM and WE need to change WE stance on who deserves THE BEST FOR THEM AND NOT FOR YOU , and recognize that all children deserve THE BEST FOR THEM AND NOT FOR YOU .
WE get HER POCKETS IF SHE WAS STANDING , WORKING AT THE STOVE , THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA , CALIFORNIA 's CALIFORNIA .
JUST LAST WEEK a group from Texas made some kind of motorized something and THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA won over THE KIDS WHO DID WELL ON THE CALCULUS TEST FOR THE ACT OR THE SAT IN CALIFORNIA from HARVARD .
What JUST LAST WEEK says is that there is a teacher in THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND A LACK OF STANDARD LANGUAGE SKILLS who has the motivational techniques and the knowledge to pull out of OUR STUDENTS is in THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND A LACK OF STANDARD LANGUAGE SKILLS .
BENJAMIN MAYS WHO WAS A PRESIDENT OF MOREHOUSE AT ONE TIME , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR understand BENJAMIN MAYS WHO WAS A PRESIDENT OF MOREHOUSE AT ONE TIME had ONE .
BENJAMIN MAYS WHO WAS A PRESIDENT OF MOREHOUSE AT ONE TIME could go to an assembly and speak , and A STUDENT WHO WAS FAILING would become so inspired that THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND A LACK OF STANDARD LANGUAGE SKILLS would pass .
One of his students wrote that `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was making A FAILING GRADE and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR went to see Benny Mays '' and A STUDENT WHO WAS FAILING went back and aced A COURSE .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think WE need faith in HER KIDS , and let HER KIDS know HER KIDS .
WE need assembly programs and session room programs , THE THINGS WE HAD THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE were THE THINGS WE HAD THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE .
Session room meant that-were YOU ever in A SESSION ROOM PROGRAM , do YOU know what A SESSION ROOM PROGRAM is ?
YOU are assigned to A TEACHER , YOU report to THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY and that gives YOU admission to the school for A DAY .
YOU report to YOU session room teacher , YOU are A NINE , or NINE B , or nine one , whatever , YOU have ten ninth grade classes that YOU have to designate a number or A LETTER to .
YOU report to that teacher for check in .
If something is going on , YOU may be with that teacher for fifteen minutes or YOU may be with YOUR SESSION ROOM TEACHER , YOU ARE NINE A , OR NINE B , OR NINE ONE , WHATEVER , YOU HAVE TEN NINTH GRADE CLASSES THAT YOU HAVE TO DESIGNATE A NUMBER OR A LETTER TO for thirty minutes .
If during activity periods , YOU auditorium is not large enough for all students to attend , MAYBE NINTH AND TENTH GRADERS or tenth and twelfth graders will go to assembly today and THE OTHERS are with YOUR SESSION ROOM TEACHER , YOU ARE NINE A , OR NINE B , OR NINE ONE , WHATEVER , YOU HAVE TEN NINTH GRADE CLASSES THAT YOU HAVE TO DESIGNATE A NUMBER OR A LETTER TO .
THE TEACHER THAT HAD BEEN IN THE DAY also had YOU schedule because YOU schedule was also in THE OFFICE .
If a parent came and needed to know something , MAYBE NINTH AND TENTH GRADERS could also check with YOUR SESSION ROOM TEACHER , YOU ARE NINE A , OR NINE B , OR NINE ONE , WHATEVER , YOU HAVE TEN NINTH GRADE CLASSES THAT YOU HAVE TO DESIGNATE A NUMBER OR A LETTER TO .
YOU grades went to YOUR SESSION ROOM TEACHER , YOU ARE NINE A , OR NINE B , OR NINE ONE , WHATEVER , YOU HAVE TEN NINTH GRADE CLASSES THAT YOU HAVE TO DESIGNATE A NUMBER OR A LETTER TO , now YOUR SCHEDULE 's all on COMPUTERS NOW , but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had a grade book for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR session room students .
So THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR knew what MARY made in MATH , SCIENCE , History and P.E. and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR could talk with MARY about SCIENCE .
During that twenty or thirty minutes , THE ISSUES were discussed .
MOST of US had a little box on US desk , what do US want to talk about today ? US elected SESSION ROOM OFFICERS , so YOU knew what MOST was like to be a PRESIDENT , Secretary or Treasurer , YOU learned that .
US would have discussions about whatever was in the newspapers and US had good questioning skills .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR remember sitting outside of JOSETTE COLLINS 'S room when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did n't have A SESSION ROOM , just in awe of the kinds of questions JOSETTE COLLINS 'S could ask .
US did not tell SESSION ROOM OFFICERS to think one way or another , but US wanted SESSION ROOM OFFICERS to question what the evidence was .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR heard THOSE KIDS COMPLAINING ABOUT FOOD ONE DAY , someone said something to THOSE KIDS COMPLAINING ABOUT FOOD ONE DAY about not wasting food and one of the students felt that comment should not have been made .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR overheard this in A SESSION ROOM and said , `` Let 'S work something out . '' -LSB- working community , non-working community . -RSB-
Among THE NONWORKING COMMUNITY THESE PEOPLE are disabled and THESE PEOPLE bodied who are not working .
Now , WE have A GOVERNMENT , THESE PEOPLE get paid and WE streets get paved .
WE tore up STRIPS OF PAPER to make A GOVERNMENT money .
YOU work , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR will take SOME OF THIS MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE .
SOME OF THIS MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE 's alright for THESE PEOPLE that are disabled , but for THESE PEOPLE .
. . now one of you ca n't work , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have to go back to THE THINGS WE HAD THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE and take even more money .
Without saying anything , THESE PEOPLE became aware of an economic system and -LSB- the dream . -RSB-
THE WRONG VALUE
If changes were made to SCHOOLS THAT ARE WHITE so that everybody was getting equal resources and THESE PEOPLE had QUALITY PREPARED TEACHERS WHO EXPECTED THEM TO DO THEIR VERY BEST , what difference would THE WRONG VALUE make in that situation if there was racial diversity within ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL ?
In ONE SENSE ONE SENSE would not make any difference and in ANOTHER ANOTHER would .
ONE SENSE would take QUALITY PREPARED TEACHERS WHO EXPECTED THEM TO DO THEIR VERY BEST back to Thurgood Marshall .
As long as OUR STUDENTS know in THESE PEOPLE hearts that one is not better because of race , because QUALITY PREPARED TEACHERS WHO EXPECTED THEM TO DO THEIR VERY BEST schools in THE BIRMINGHAM now are segregated , QUALITY PREPARED TEACHERS WHO EXPECTED THEM TO DO THEIR VERY BEST have very few white students .
YOU must be prepared for what YOU want to do and present YOU as best YOU can .
Then remember what BISHOP VASHTI MCKENZIE said , ` NO FAULT IN HIM is not always in the stone ' , and what BISHOP VASHTI MCKENZIE said that YOU may be rejected , but NO FAULT IN HIM 's how YOU look at rejection .
BISHOP VASHTI MCKENZIE gave several examples , and one was that NELSON MANDELA was rejected but there was NO FAULT IN HIM .
ADAM CLAYTON POWELL was rejected and removed from the government structure , but NO FAULT IN HIM was not in ADAM CLAYTON POWELL .
ADAM CLAYTON POWELL knew too much and ADAM CLAYTON POWELL knew what others were doing so let 'S get rid of ADAM CLAYTON POWELL .
So , if OUR STUDENTS know that rejection does not equate with fault then YOU have a foundation to move into THE NONWORKING COMMUNITY .
Recognize the power of language ; recognize that the language of THAT PARTICULAR MARKET PLACE is as much YOU as anyone else 's .
So YOU will not respond to what is authentic and what is not authentic , allowing that to control YOU life .
If someone says YOU talk or YOU run or YOU act or YOU think white , there is an economic issue .
Think economically , that does not belong , NO ONE has A MONOPOLY ON THAT .
So , if YOU think honor , NO ONE has A MONOPOLY ON THAT .
Learn THE LANGUAGE ; no one has A MONOPOLY ON THAT .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR just saw on THE NEWS THE BLACK GIRL , who knows Arabic extremely well , and there 's A YOUNG WOMAN IN BIRMINGHAM WHO KNOWS JAPANESE and A YOUNG WOMAN IN BIRMINGHAM WHO KNOWS JAPANESE 's the interpreter for the Japanese car folk in BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ON THURSDAY .
THE BLACK GIRL completed THE JAPANESE STUDIES PROGRAM at DILLARD and is doing very well .
Just think about THE JAPANESE STUDIES PROGRAM , SHARE CROPPER 'S TENANT HOUSES are young African American women moving into cultures where WOMEN are not thought highly of in the FIRST place .
-LSB- So THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think that THE JAPANESE STUDIES PROGRAM has to do with SELF ESTEEM , but THESE PEOPLE think that when YOU say that YOU are telling HER KIDS that all HER KIDS need to do is have a good f eeling , SELF ESTEEM 's artificial . -RSB-
SELF ESTEEM is extremely important , but SELF ESTEEM comes about from genuine work .
We have to teach THAT CHILDREN that THAT CHILDREN can feel good about THAT CHILDREN if THAT CHILDREN clean THE KITCHEN and stand back and say that kitchen looks good , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did A GOOD JOB with A GOOD JOB .
Or , ' THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR wrote that A PAPER 's well written , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can feel good about THE KITCHEN ' .
A PAPER 's not false esteem , A PAPER 's not just telling THAT CHILDREN YOU need to feel good about YOU , A MAN WHO NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL ONE DAY IN HIS LIFE - NOR MY GRANDMOTHER , do something well and THAT CHILDREN 's how THAT CHILDREN comes about .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had THE KIND OF THING WE NEED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SELF ESTEEM , THAT I CAN READ A POEM , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can do A DAY .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think THE KIND OF THING WE NEED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SELF ESTEEM , THAT I CAN READ A POEM 's THE KIND OF THING WE NEED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SELF ESTEEM , THAT I CAN READ A POEM and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can read THE KIND OF THING WE NEED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SELF ESTEEM , THAT I CAN READ A POEM well .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can enter into a conversation , or THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know when to say something and when to be A GOOD LISTENER .
THE WRONG VALUE
... know that THEY are worth something , THEY have value .
If WE do n't help THEY see WE then somebody else will , and perhaps THE WRONG VALUE 's THE WRONG VALUE that THEY will see .
Teach THEY how to do something well , and that in THE WRONG VALUE brings about SELF ESTEEM that WE talk about .
THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do have value , rather than just say THOSE THINGS and then ask THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING what THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING can do well -
And THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING do n't know .
Right , or THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING want A GOOD EXPERIENCE but THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING do n't want to work for this and do n't want to work for A GOOD EXPERIENCE .
Then THE BALL IN THE CHILD 'S COURT is in THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING court to tell us what THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING can do , and who knows that YOU can do THE BALL IN THE CHILD 'S COURT .
YOU tell THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING when YOU leave that THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING need to live HIS OWN LIFE so that at least AND THREE people who are not related to YOU can recommend YOU for A GOOD EXPERIENCE .
THAT I AM WORTH SOMETHING are not getting THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT GET KIDS GOING now .
If YOU are going to apply for A GOOD EXPERIENCE , YOU are going to say to THOSE PEOPLE by how YOU dress and how YOU present THOSE PEOPLE .
YOU do n't dress for YOU friends ; YOU look at what 's there .
YOU explore THEIR COMPANY , YOU go with knowledge about THE COMPANY-WE USED TO TELL KIDS THAT , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm not sure THE COMPANY-WE USED TO TELL KIDS THAT are being told that now , or taught HER KIDS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR ca n't say because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm not in THE CLASSROOM , but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know WE did THE CLASSROOM .
When YOU 're with YOU friends and YOU dress A CERTAIN WAY , but if YOU go into a business and YOU want GOOD FRIENDS to employ YOU , there are ways of presenting YOU .
If HER KIDS are never told how to present HER KIDS , how will HER KIDS know ? If HER KIDS are from A HOME WHERE THE PARENTS DO N'T KNOW , AND WE HAVE TO ASSUME THAT SOME DO N'T KNOW BECAUSE THEY have not had THE EXPERIENCES .
A HOME WHERE THE PARENTS DO N'T KNOW , AND WE HAVE TO ASSUME THAT SOME DO N'T KNOW BECAUSE THEY 's interesting that YOU have so many specific ideas about improvements that could be done for ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL , but YOU do n't sound as pessimistic about THE BIRMINGHAM schools as most of the people KIMBERLY HILL have interviewed .
So TOO MANY OF THEM say that the public school system is just too far gone , that HER KIDS are too rowdy or violent , or do n't listen and that YOUR PARENTS do n't help with anything .
Well , there are children in THE SYSTEM WHO ARE MEMBERS OF MY CHURCH and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR still have contact with SEVERAL TEACHERS , one at PARKER who will call THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR and tell THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR what OUR STUDENTS are doing and the papers SEVERAL TEACHERS are writing .
TOO MANY OF THEM tells THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR there are papers that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR just have to see .
There are KIDS GOING TO COLLEGE , GOING TO WORK and OUR problem is with the drop out rate .
KIDS GOING TO COLLEGE , GOING TO WORK are dropping out around THE TENTH GRADE because of the law that states YOU can drop out at age sixteen .
There are also some very good kids in THE SYSTEM WHO ARE MEMBERS OF MY CHURCH .
When OUR look at the scholarship record , OUR have to say someone is doing something .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think maybe Fairfield High School had a total of about three million dollars in TUITION SCHOLARSHIPS .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't know what the individual schools in the THE BIRMINGHAM system have received , but THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know some good things are happening .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR know some good teachers are there .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't want to live long enough to have no faith in what HER KIDS can do or what HER KIDS can become .
If WE feed HER KIDS WE pessimism in THE CLASSROOM - `` Well YOU do n't think THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can do anything anyway so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR might as well disrupt A CLASS OF WHITE STUDENTS .
. . ''
There is A TEACHER AT PARKER WHO TEACHES MATH .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had been in A CLASS for about four years because THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was looking for A STUDENT that WE were going to send on a trip .
Within FIVE MINUTES OF THAT CLASS , there was n't A STUDENT IN HIS SEAT .
ONE kid had ONE KID knee in ONE KID chair answering and talking -LSB- A STUDENT IN HIS SEAT mimics THE STUDENTS ' FRENZIED RESPONSES -RSB- THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR enjoyed that class ! A STUDENT IN HIS SEAT was just asking QUESTIONS and pointing to OUR STUDENTS ; that class was as exciting as THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR high school math teacher was .
STUDENTS WHO BARELY MADE IT AND SOME WHO HAVE COME TO ME IN TEARS TO SAY ` I 'M GLAD TO SEE YOU BECAUSE I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT YOU WERE TO ME ' were standing , STUDENTS WHO BARELY MADE IT AND SOME WHO HAVE COME TO ME IN TEARS TO SAY ` I 'M GLAD TO SEE YOU BECAUSE I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT YOU WERE TO ME ' were just gung ho ! ONE was wonderful ! There was excitement , and those same kids could probably go down CARNEGIE HALL to someone else 's classroom and not do anything .
STUDENTS WHO BARELY MADE IT AND SOME WHO HAVE COME TO ME IN TEARS TO SAY ` I 'M GLAD TO SEE YOU BECAUSE I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT YOU WERE TO ME ' need to be taught as ONE MAN IN WASHINGTON told ONE MAN IN WASHINGTON could happen there .
ONE MAN IN WASHINGTON taught ONE MAN IN WASHINGTON students how not to be tolerant of poor teaching , that YOU might joke for one day but the second day ONE MAN IN WASHINGTON .
YOU owe WE .
THIS PRINCIPAL said THIS PRINCIPAL went outside and talked to THE WINOS AND DRUG ADDICTS , took THE WINOS AND DRUG ADDICTS some lunch and said , `` YOU have YOUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS at A GOOD SCHOOL .
If the windows are broken in THE SUMMER TO HELP ME WITH BOOKS THE SUMMER TO HELP ME WITH BOOKS 's hot in there and if THE WINOS AND DRUG ADDICTS 're broken in the winter THE SUMMER TO HELP ME WITH BOOKS 's cold , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR need YOU help to protect A GOOD SCHOOL .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR need YOU to put YOU needles in garbage cans so YOU nieces and nephews or YOU children wo n't step on YOUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS . ''
THIS PRINCIPAL said every once in a while THIS PRINCIPAL would go out , bring YOUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS sandwiches and ask YOUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS how YOUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS were doing .
NO MORE BROKEN WINDOWS , NO MORE BROKEN WINDOWS 's how A WHITE SCHOOL would have to take CARE OF THESE PEOPLE .
Now A WHITE SCHOOL 's A WHITE SCHOOL .
Yes .
Why call the police , THEY 'll just run THEY off for A DAY .
Tell THEY that this is what WE need YOU to do .
So , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have hope .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can not throw away WE children .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR have hope .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR think WE have to listen to TEACHING CHILDREN OF THE OPPOSITE RACE , to what 's going on in TEACHING CHILDREN OF THE OPPOSITE RACE heads .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would not want to be a teenager today because there are too many things out there .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't know that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would climb through all of that , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't know that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR would swim across all of that or through all of that , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR do n't know .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR did have strong people standing , saying YOU can do THIS .
A GREAT FARMER counted on THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR .
When A GREAT FARMER would take HIS COTTON to gin when THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was in fifth grade , that cotton was twenty one and three fourths cents a pound and FIVE HUNDRED was FIVE HUNDRED and whatever and A GREAT FARMER would look at THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR and say figure that , because if YOU go to school YOU were supposed to learn something .
THE MAN WITH THE MACHINE HITTING AND PULLING THE LEAF OFF THE SIDE would say THE MACHINE HITTING AND PULLING THE LEAF OFF THE SIDE 's so and so and so and so , but A GREAT FARMER would say she will figure THE MACHINE HITTING AND PULLING THE LEAF OFF THE SIDE , so THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had to be right .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had to know how to change FRACTIONS to THE DECIMALS and multiply , put THE DECIMALS in the right place and say THIS 's THIS .
If THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR could do FRACTIONS , and if TEACHERS WHO TAUGHT ME COULD HAVE FAITH IN ME , WHO CAME TO SCHOOL NOT SPEAKING STANDARD ENGLISH , NOT EVEN KNOWING WHAT THAT WAS ... WHO KNEW THAT I WAS NOT IN SCHOOL IN SEPTEMBER UNLESS IT RAINED , FOR MOST OF OCTOBER , WHO KNEW THAT IN APRIL WE WERE GOING TO SOW THESE SEEDS AND IN MAY WE WERE GOING TO CHOP COTTON AND I 'D GET TO COME TO SCHOOLS TWO OR THREE DAYS , WHO KNEW THAT ! Still had sufficient faith to say THIS is what YOU need to know .
If YOU ca n't buy HIS BOOK then go to the library , WE have copies and copies of Wuthering Heights .
Invisible Man was written at THE END OF THAT YEAR .
All of the Victorian novels , WE have copies of SHAKESPEARE , YOU take BLACK LITERATURE BOOKS and YOU read TEACHERS WHO TAUGHT ME COULD HAVE FAITH IN ME , WHO CAME TO SCHOOL NOT SPEAKING STANDARD ENGLISH , NOT EVEN KNOWING WHAT THAT WAS ... WHO KNEW THAT I WAS NOT IN SCHOOL IN SEPTEMBER UNLESS IT RAINED , FOR MOST OF OCTOBER , WHO KNEW THAT IN APRIL WE WERE GOING TO SOW THESE SEEDS AND IN MAY WE WERE GOING TO CHOP COTTON AND I 'D GET TO COME TO SCHOOLS TWO OR THREE DAYS , WHO KNEW THAT ! .
WE give YOU QUESTIONS and when YOU come back YOU are on target .
With all of that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR graduated valedictorian of A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS , and A TIME BEFORE GRANTS AND LOANS was because of TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART .
When THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR left school , WE had a Biology lab and WE had a Chemistry lab and this was unusual and there are folks now who say how did YOU have all of that ? WE did .
TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART , as THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said , made A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A PROFESSOR , AN INSTRUCTOR .
TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART had FAITH IN ME , WHO CAME TO SCHOOL NOT SPEAKING STANDARD ENGLISH , NOT EVEN KNOWING WHAT THAT WAS ... WHO KNEW THAT I WAS NOT IN SCHOOL IN SEPTEMBER UNLESS IT RAINED , so how could THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR not have faith in CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE ? THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR taught CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE and saw THEIR GROWTH , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR saw CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE but left with full plates .
Because of THE HAYES PACESETTER faculty-I saw that , and THE HAYES PACESETTER does n't matter .
WE had children from the KINGSTON housing project , Southtown housing project , DIXIE HOUSING PROJECT-BECAUSE THEY BUSED THEM PAST WOODLAWN HIGH SCHOOL , PLUS WE HAD THE KIDS FROM THE PRIVATE HOMES , DIXIE HOUSING PROJECT-BECAUSE THEY BUSED THEM PAST WOODLAWN HIGH SCHOOL , PLUS WE HAD THE KIDS FROM THE PRIVATE HOMES , WE were A GOOD SCHOOL .
THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO felt good about being HAYES HIGH PACESETTERS , and THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR hope that HAYES HIGH PACESETTERS will return because THE ALUMNI FROM HAYES are now working with THE ALUMNI FROM HAYES .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR charge to THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO at THE STUDENTS WHO CAME IN FOUR YEARS AGO big reunion was everyone that is good in math form a team-remember YOU do n't run ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL , there is a principal and there are TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART .
YOU go and ask if there is a space or a room where YOU can go and work with THE CHILDREN IN MATH .
If somebody needs to know Calculus and THE CHILDREN IN MATH do n't have a Calculus teacher , YOU go teach THE CHILDREN IN MATH Calculus .
COMMUNITY TUTORS .
Right .
If YOU are good with language than YOU need to do COMMUNITY TUTORS . , too .
If YOU are a business man , go in and have conversations with TUTORS about business .
Tell TUTORS that A CERTAIN WAY are presenting TUTORS , YOU would not hire TUTORS .
The business world will not tell TUTORS that , TUTORS will never know why TUTORS did n't get hired , but YOU can tell TUTORS that .
If YOU are good in BIOLOGY , then go out and get TUTORS what TUTORS need to dissect-now BIOLOGY 's all done on COMPUTERS NOW , virtual dissection or whatever .
Do THOSE THINGS .
If YOU know Physics , then get in there and get a Physics class going .
Do n't usurp anybody 's authority , but YOU get THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF , and then YOU will have what YOU need .
OUR STANCE TO TEACH KIDS SOCIAL SKILLS AND ALSO GENERAL NEGOTIATION SKILLS FOR THE WORLD OUT THERE is still THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR stance , get THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF excited about learning .
OUR STANCE TO TEACH KIDS SOCIAL SKILLS AND ALSO GENERAL NEGOTIATION SKILLS FOR THE WORLD OUT THERE is not rote that THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR walk in and lecture at the college level .
YOU can do INTRODUCTORY lectures in high school , but YOU engage INTRODUCTORY to find out what INTRODUCTORY are thinking , INTRODUCTORY responses and YOU read .
YOU have to read .
Walk into a classroom READING SOMETHING , READING SOMETHING , put HIS BOOK down and start the class - `` What were YOU reading ? '' -LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'll give YOU the name of HIS BOOK -
Get THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR curious .
RIGHT ask THEM what THEM are reading .
Sometimes THEM are reading stuff that THEM say YOU ca n't read .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'd say , `` THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm married and have CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE and YOU say YOU 're reading something THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR ca n't read ? '' CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE 'd say yes .
LAUGHTER , that starts CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE , YOU walk in and put A STATEMENT on THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD , A STATEMENT does n't matter , just put something on THE -LSB- SCHOOL -RSB- BOARD .
CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE look at LAUGHTER for A WHILE , then CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE look at YOU and then CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE look at LAUGHTER again .
YOU leave LAUGHTER for FIVE MINUTES OF THAT CLASS .
CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE will think and talk and look at THE LOGIC OF THAT ONE SENTENCE .
Or YOU write THE LOGIC OF THAT ONE SENTENCE up , tell CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE to write THE LOGIC OF THAT ONE SENTENCE down and then go on with whatever DOING-IT DOES N'T MATTER THE COURSE , P.E. OR ANYTHING were DOING-IT DOES N'T MATTER THE COURSE , P.E. OR ANYTHING , because YOU are generating a curiosity about THE LAST WORDS TO ME .
No matter what YOU know , YOU have to put THE LOGIC OF THAT ONE SENTENCE into THE LAST WORDS TO ME , even if THE LOGIC OF THAT ONE SENTENCE 's on a computer .
If YOU are A MATH WHIZ , YOU still have SYMBOLS THAT YOU MUST PUT ON PAPER , and CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE TABLE WITH VERY LITTLE need to know SYMBOLS THAT YOU MUST PUT ON PAPER .
So , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm excited about THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF and with THEM OUT system discussing a new program for HER KIDS .
Someone asked whether OUR SYSTEM DISCUSSING A NEW PROGRAM FOR KIDS WHO ARE SERIOUS DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS will be OUR SYSTEM DISCUSSING A NEW PROGRAM FOR KIDS WHO ARE SERIOUS DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS and will THEM OUT just tire THEM OUT .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said there is ONE other component YOU will need , and ONE is ONE .
If HIM WITH ONE PAGE OF MY DUNGEON goes out and runs around THE TRACK , then comes back and YOU slap HIM WITH ONE PAGE OF MY DUNGEON Shook with James Baldwin , and YOU demand that THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF read THE TRACK and talk to YOU about THE TRACK .
Then YOU pull one page or one paragraph from Malcolm X saying THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR was not literate THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR wanted to write A LETTER but could not , what was HIM WITH ONE PAGE OF MY DUNGEON talking about THE FUNDAMENTAL SETTING OF A TABLE ? Where was HIM WITH ONE PAGE OF MY DUNGEON when HIM WITH ONE PAGE OF MY DUNGEON died in relation to where HIM WITH ONE PAGE OF MY DUNGEON was then ? YOU pull A PAGE FROM EDGAR ALLEN POE THAT HAS ALL THIS DREARY , COLD STUFF AND YOU read A PAGE FROM EDGAR ALLEN POE THAT HAS ALL THIS DREARY , COLD STUFF AND YOU ` the heart thumping under the floor and YOU are hearing a heart that 's not beating ' , what 's going on there ? THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF have to come up with answers and YOU get THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF engaged .
Then YOU do not hurt THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF by asking for in AN ENGLISH CLASSROOM , YOU must learn PACESETTER ENGLISH .
AN ENGLISH CLASSROOM 's not going to hurt anybody , let THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF speak THEIR OWN LANGUAGE .
Well , THEIR OWN LANGUAGE is not going to get THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF some places that THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF might want to go , THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF are not going to forget THE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING STUFF .
See THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm bidialectal , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can go to MARION ROGERS , BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ON THURSDAY and say `` Hi dere y' all '' and `` Hi Cousin so-and-so '' and -LSB- other examples of country dialect -RSB- ; THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR can do all of that with ease .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm not going to forget that because A PART OF THEIR ESTABLISHMENT is A PART OF THEIR ESTABLISHMENT and what THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR am .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR also learned from TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART and from courses PACESETTER ENGLISH , the language of the marketplace .
Not good English , but PACESETTER ENGLISH .
PACESETTER ENGLISH will put YOU in good stead in CERTAIN SITUATIONS , and YOU need to know CERTAIN SITUATIONS .
YOU ca n't play football if YOU do n't know the rules of A FOOTBALL GAME , and so A FOOTBALL GAME 's how YOU use what A FOOTBALL GAME is that TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART have .
YOU also ask HER KIDS , what HER KIDS want to become .
YOU do n't get there overnight ; YOU are on A DESIGNATED WAY now .
If YOU want to be a fashion designer that means TEACHERS , PHYSICS , HISTORY , FLORENCE TERRELL IN ART must be on YOUR TOES FOR THAT PERSON .
Name SOME FASHION DESIGNERS and ask SOME FASHION DESIGNERS if SOME FASHION DESIGNERS know anything about SOME FASHION DESIGNERS , YOU give SOME FASHION DESIGNERS A RESEARCH PROJECT TO FIND OUT ABOUT FASHION DESIGN .
Find out what A RESEARCH PROJECT TO FIND OUT ABOUT FASHION DESIGN is SOME FASHION DESIGNERS want to do .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR had to ask THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR grandson who just graduated from high school and MY GRANDSON WHO JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL said MY GRANDSON WHO JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL wants to be COMPUTER ENGINEER , what is that ?
Did MY GRANDSON WHO JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL explain A RESEARCH PROJECT TO FIND OUT ABOUT FASHION DESIGN ?
MY GRANDSON WHO JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL explained some of A RESEARCH PROJECT TO FIND OUT ABOUT FASHION DESIGN .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR asked what YOU have to do to become that , MY GRANDSON WHO JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL was n't sure .
Now , YOU should go online and look up THE REQUIRED COURSES for three colleges for becoming COMPUTER ENGINEER and when YOU get that come back .
The FIRST semester Calculus 1 and COMPUTER ENGINEER said COMPUTER ENGINEER did n't know 1 would require Calculus .
THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR said see , FIRST sounds good , but then YOU get here and FIRST says electronics .
YOU did n't say technician , YOU said COMPUTER ENGINEER .
Do YOU know what ENGINEERING means ? COMPUTER ENGINEER looked at THE REQUIRED COURSES , COMPUTER ENGINEER 's going to try ENGINEERING and if COMPUTER ENGINEER puts COMPUTER ENGINEER mind to JUST A FANTASTIC MIND COMPUTER ENGINEER will do JUST A FANTASTIC MIND , but COMPUTER ENGINEER had no idea of the course load .
Physics and Calculus , TWO OF THE HEAVIEST COURSES ONE CAN TAKE , in THE FIRST YEAR .
HER KIDS need to know HER KIDS .
TWO OF THE HEAVIEST COURSES ONE CAN TAKE 's not , `` Oh , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm going to be '' and YOU wiggle YOU nose or YOU clap YOU hands and YOU become that , so HER KIDS need to know .
So , THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR 'm not pessimistic about OUR STUDENTS and what HER KIDS can do and what HER KIDS will become .
TOO MANY OF THEM are doing well , not enough , but enough for THE FIRST BLACK ENGLISH SUPERVISOR to see HER KIDS as evidence that WE are not losing all of our children .
One is too many , but WE are not losing HER KIDS all .
Thank YOU very much .
