THURSDAY JUNE 16TH is THURSDAY JUNE 16TH and DYNAMITE HILL am at THE LAW OFFICES OF MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
Thank THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION for having DYNAMITE HILL .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK 're welcome .
WE are going to be discussing HIS EXPERIENCE in school desegregation in THE BIRMINGHAM SCHOOLS .
WE are going to start with HIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL , go through high school and then THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION general impressions of how desegregation changed BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE .
Whether THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION think HIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL was a good change or if there are other goals that needed to be filled .
Well , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to several elementary schools .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mother was A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER , A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER was A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER .
At THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE , if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK could bring YOUR CHILDREN to school when YOUR CHILDREN were THE FIVE .
So , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mother took MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to school with A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA started at McCaw Elementary in SEPTEMBER OF 1962 when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was five years old .
SEPTEMBER OF 1962 was probably SEPTEMBER OF 1962 , SEPTEMBER OF 1962 was SEPTEMBER OF 1962 .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to MCCAW for THE FIRST grade .
About HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE they skipped MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to the SECOND grade because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA could already read .
Then MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to THE THIRD GRADE the following year .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA stayed at MCCAW and finished THIRD grade there .
In FOURTH grade MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to Wilkerson School , which is over in between COLLEGE HILLS , AS THAT NEIGHBORHOODS ' COMPLEXION CHANGED THEN THE SCHOOLS CHANGED TOO and East Thomas .
Again , BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME are BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME .
While at Wilkerson in the FOURTH grade MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got tested by A WOMAN named Dr. Alexenia Young-Baldwin , who was an enrichment teacher .
A WOMAN is A WOMAN now , as a matter of FACT , PROFESSOR EMERITUS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK .
A WOMAN is a whirlwind authority on gifted children 's education .
There was a push to desegregate not only the regular elementary schools but also special education , which was for PEOPLE WHO WERE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED OR CHALLENGED , SPECIAL NEEDS and also gifted and talented and musically inclined .
So , A WOMAN tested a large number of black FOURTH graders in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE and out of THE GROUP THAT HAD THE HIGHEST SCORES THEY PUT TOGETHER AN ENRICHMENT CLASS TO GO TO WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL , WHICH IS WHERE I WENT IN FIFTH GRADE .
While MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was at WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL something happened in THE CASE apparently , and PEOPLE WHO WERE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED OR CHALLENGED , SPECIAL NEEDS selected three of us from that all black enrichment class to go and integrate AN ALL WHITE ENRICHMENT CLASS AT ELYTON SCHOOL .
So , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would have been in FIFTH grade THEN so that would have been in October , November or December of 1967 .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to AN ALL WHITE ENRICHMENT CLASS AT ELYTON SCHOOL and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA stayed there and finished EIGHTH grade at ELYTON VILLAGE .
There were ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS .
We had one teacher the entire day , one by the name of META AYERS , who is still alive in SEPTEMBER OF 1962 .
After MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA finished there , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to Indian Springs Preparatory School as a boarding student .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA boarded there for all four years .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA graduated from there MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got a scholarship to go to Princeton University , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA finished PRINCETON in 1978 with a degree in POLITICAL SCIENCE .
Then MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW THAT FALL and graduated from there with MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA Jurist Doctorate in 1981 .
So , HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW THAT FALL is HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW THAT FALL .
So THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION started out as a gifted student very young .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did , but MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was just fortunate .
BOTH MY PARENTS were BOTH MY PARENTS , and both of BOTH MY PARENTS read A LOT .
A VORACIOUS READER was A VORACIOUS READER ; A VORACIOUS READER used to read TWO or ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS newspapers .
It was actually interesting , because at the time with what was going on with THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT IS AS GOOD , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had to read TWO OR THREE NEWSPAPERS from outside of THE STATE , THAT WAS N'T HERE because THE BIRMINGHAM NEWS was n't reporting a lot of THE STUFF THAT WAS HAPPENING HERE PEOPLE .
So A VORACIOUS READER used to read - there was A BLACK NEWSPAPER OUT OF CLEVELAND , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think A BLACK NEWSPAPER OUT OF CLEVELAND was The CHICAGO Defender perhaps , but it was a black newspaper that was giving a lot of very , very good coverage on THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT IS AS GOOD .
A VORACIOUS READER used to have to read that newspaper to find out what was going on JUST HERE .
There were TWO black newspapers in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE , THE BIRMINGHAM WORLD and THE BIRMINGHAM TIMES .
THE BIRMINGHAM WORLD is no longer in existence ; THE BIRMINGHAM TIMES is still here now .
JUST HERE were really more as MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA remember JUST HERE kind of events and gossip related newspapers and not really that focused on hard news .
So A VERY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT FOR JOURNALISTS was A VERY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT FOR JOURNALISTS even to have access to THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER , because A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT WAS HAPPENING HERE PEOPLE did n't really want A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT WAS HAPPENING HERE PEOPLE to be recorded .
Or JOURNALISTS were under PRESSURE NOT to record PRESSURE NOT .
Sure , sure .
-LSB- PHONE RINGS . -RSB-
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA fourth-grade teacher in THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL had a Ph D. , in elementary education .
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS STRANGE ABOUT THE DESEGREGATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN BIRMINGHAM was because what THEY did in many instances was THEY took the best , most qualified , most well trained TEACHERS FROM THE ALL BLACK SCHOOLS and put TEACHERS FROM THE ALL BLACK SCHOOLS in THE FORMERLY ALL WHITE SCHOOLS and then THEY replaced THEY with WHITE TEACHERS THAT WERE RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE .
And so , ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS STRANGE ABOUT THE DESEGREGATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN BIRMINGHAM diluted the talent and experience pool in BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME .
Also , THE FIRST CHILDREN THAT BEGAN TO INTEGRATE THE FORMERLY ALL WHITE SCHOOLS were THE FIRST CHILDREN THAT BEGAN TO INTEGRATE THE FORMERLY ALL WHITE SCHOOLS .
THE FIRST CHILDREN THAT BEGAN TO INTEGRATE THE FORMERLY ALL WHITE SCHOOLS tended to be as THE GROUP THAT HAD THE HIGHEST SCORES THEY PUT TOGETHER AN ENRICHMENT CLASS TO GO TO WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL , WHICH IS WHERE I WENT IN FIFTH GRADE , better students , certainly more economically advantaged than some of THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
So WHAT REALLY HAS HAPPENED IN BIRMINGHAM AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATION IS THAT THE BLACK SCHOOLS HAVE GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT WORSE AND THE WHITE SCHOOLS , WHICH WERE INTEGRATED TO SOME DEGREE BUT NOT REALLY INTEGRATED , have gotten A WHOLE LOT better .
The disparities in A GOOD POINT TO MAKE may be worse now than WHAT REALLY HAS HAPPENED IN BIRMINGHAM AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATION IS THAT THE BLACK SCHOOLS HAVE GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT WORSE AND THE WHITE SCHOOLS , WHICH WERE INTEGRATED TO SOME DEGREE BUT NOT REALLY INTEGRATED were in 1967 .
A GOOD POINT TO MAKE 's A GOOD POINT TO MAKE .
Well , because what MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have is a city school system where , although only seventy percent of THE POPULATION OF BIRMINGHAM is black , about ninety five percent of the school population is black .
THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION are talking about currently ?
Talking about currently , in THE BIRMINGHAM SCHOOLS .
Because THE WHITE STUDENTS WHO GO TO INDIAN SPRINGS have fled to SUBURBAN SCHOOLS , and because of THE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA we do n't have home rule in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE so THE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA is very restricted on THE CITY , WHICH WAS SEVENTY PERCENT BLACK ability to put additional funds into education .
So , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have run down SUBURBAN SCHOOLS , low paid teachers and then MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have extraordinary schools in THE SUBURBS .
Therefore , MANY OF THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES are moving there so MANY OF THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES can send THEIR KIDS to better schools .
Just like DR. JULIUS WILSON talks about , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have a situation now where many of THE ROLE MODELS THAT USED TO BE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY NO LONGER live there .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA grew up in A CHURCH where there was THE ONLY BLACK LAWYER LICENSED IN THE STATE , THE ONLY BLACK LAWYER LICENSED IN THE STATE .
THE ONLY BLACK LAWYER LICENSED IN THE STATE was THE ONLY BLACK LAWYER LICENSED IN THE STATE and THE ONLY BLACK LAWYER LICENSED IN THE STATE went to A CHURCH .
There were ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS other black lawyers that went to A CHURCH , and A CHURCH was probably A CHURCH .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had SEVERAL PH.D. S THAT WENT TO MY CHURCH .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH here in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE .
THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH was really through A CHURCH that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ended up going to INDIAN SPRINGS because what happened was that during THE DESEGREGATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN BIRMINGHAM struggles here , A CHURCH was affiliated with a white congregation called the Plymouth Congregational Church in MOUNTAIN BROOK , which is probably the most affluent community in THE STATE , THAT WAS N'T HERE .
SEVERAL PH.D. S THAT WENT TO MY CHURCH started a discussion group called BLACK and WHITE Together , where WHITE TEENAGERS would come and have CHURCH SERVICES WITH US and then US would go and have church services with WHITE TEENAGERS and then US would have meetings a couple of evenings a month to talk about THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA believe that the solution to bigotry is just for PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA to get to know each other , because a lot of bigotry is based on ignorance .
MANY OF THESE KIDS , THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE THEY HAD KNOWN were PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had known some white people , but not very many .
Until MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got an opportunity to meet PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA there and MANY OF THEM were talking about the secondary education that MANY OF THEM were looking forward to and the colleges MANY OF THEM were looking forward to .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA started thinking about THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE THEY HAD KNOWN and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA thought THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE THEY HAD KNOWN are n't any smarter than MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA am , if THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE THEY HAD KNOWN can go to these private schools and if THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE THEY HAD KNOWN can go to PRINCETON and SUBURBAN SCHOOLS like that then MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA can apply and maybe MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA can get in too .
THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE THEY HAD KNOWN was really how MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ended up at PRINCETON , to be honest with MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK .
There was A KID FROM MY SCHOOL WHO APPLIED THERE AND DID N'T GET IN , and A KID FROM MY SCHOOL WHO APPLIED THERE AND DID N'T GET IN said that A KID FROM MY SCHOOL WHO APPLIED THERE AND DID N'T GET IN thought THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE THEY HAD KNOWN just were n't taking STUDENTS THAT HAD GONE TO THESE MORE WELL KNOWN from BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA said MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA do n't believe PRINCETON 's true , so MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA applied and THE ONLY BLACK PEOPLE THEY HAD KNOWN let MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA in and gave MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA A SCHOLARSHIP .
PRINCETON was PRINCETON .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA THE FIRST exposure to integration in SUBURBAN SCHOOLS was very , very bad .
MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO INTEGRATION IN SCHOOLS was bitter .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was spit on , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got in lots of FIGHTS and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got suspended from THE SCHOOL for fighting because of racial slurs .
The first month MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was in that class none of the white students in TWENTY-FIVE would speak to MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
The THE FIRST time we had lunch MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA came and sat down MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA lunch tray at the table with the other students in TWENTY-FIVE and every one of them got up and left .
And A SMALL CLASS WAS N'T IT was A SMALL CLASS WAS N'T IT ?
Yeah , there were TWENTY-FIVE STUDENTS .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had never been treated HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE before , and so it was very , very difficult for MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to adjust to .
Even though MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was aware of THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER were going on , but it was very different dealing with HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE on a personal basis .
Had THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION been around THE WAY PEOPLE much before THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION went to ELYTON VILLAGE ?
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had , but THE RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU HAD WITH WHITE PEOPLE then was very , very different than THE RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU HAD WITH WHITE PEOPLE is now .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK could go to stores for instance and shop down town .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK could n't try on CLOTHES .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK could n't eat at the lunch counters .
THEY had BLACK AND WHITE BATHROOMS , BLACK AND WHITE BATHROOMS and BLACK AND WHITE BATHROOMS .
THEY would usually have a bathroom for white men , a bathroom for WHITE WOMEN and then one bathroom for BLACK AND WHITE BATHROOMS .
When we would go to movie theatres here MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK would have to pay in the front and then walk around to the back of the theatre and go up some stairs to sit in the balcony .
Sometimes THEY would have segregated shows where THEY would have just shows that were only for BLACK AND WHITE BATHROOMS , at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE and then THE WHITES would go to the theatre at different times .
So , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had been exposed to THE WHITES .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had ridden on public transportation and stuff , BOTH MY PARENTS lived in the city-oh and the other major exposure that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had to THE WAY PEOPLE was because A HIGH SCHOOL COACH had a concession stand at LEGION FIELD , which is where THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA used to play THE WAY PEOPLE home football games in THE 1960S .
So , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had a lot of exposure to STILL WHITE FOLKS then because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA used to sell peanuts and popcorn and sodas to STILL WHITE FOLKS .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA started working there when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was TEN or eleven years old .
A HIGH SCHOOL COACH got MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA a job selling peanuts at the stadium .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had MY FIRST JOBS when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was TEN and eleven years old , so MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had exposure to THE WAY PEOPLE .
-LSB- another person speaking interruption -RSB- MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had always had exposure to THE WHITES because of MY FIRST JOBS , because of MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA dad 's involvement-because A VORACIOUS READER worked for the Birmingham Housing Authority and also because there were lots of Italians that owned BUSINESSES in THE BLACK COMMUNITY and WE would go THERE AND SHOP because THERE AND SHOP would serve WE .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA THE FIRST exposure to THE WAY PEOPLE , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA guess were to the Italians that were SHOP OWNERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY .
So , can THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION tell DYNAMITE HILL a little more about how the decision was made to move THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION to ELYTON VILLAGE ?
Well , what happened was there was A LAWSUIT .
One of the attorneys who was handling A LAWSUIT was THE ONLY BLACK LAWYER LICENSED IN THE STATE by the name of DEMETRIUS NEWTON , WHO IS NOW THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
THEY had filed a lawsuit to force the integration of special education .
After we had been placed in THE ALL BLACK ENRICHMENT CLASS , because HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE was HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE THEY had tried to fix THE PROBLEM .
What had happened before was that there was gifted education , but THE ALL BLACK ENRICHMENT CLASS was for WHITE only , but then under separate but equal when THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES complained about THE ALL BLACK ENRICHMENT CLASS , THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES decided that what THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES would do is set up gifted education for all black classes in BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME .
So , THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES came around and IQ 'S tested THE KIDS THAT WENT TO SCHOOL WITH ME to qualify THE KIDS THAT WENT TO SCHOOL WITH ME to go into AN ALL WHITE ENRICHMENT CLASS AT ELYTON SCHOOL , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got placed into AN ALL WHITE ENRICHMENT CLASS AT ELYTON SCHOOL .
Then of course THE CASE was resolved because separate but equal is inherently unequal .
So , THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES then allowed some of us to integrate that white class .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA learned later from DR. BALDWIN AT ONE OF OUR REUNIONS that THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES took the ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS kids in the all black gifted class that had the highest IQ 'S .
It was DR. BALDWIN AT ONE OF OUR REUNIONS .
RICHARD SHOCKLEY 'S is RICHARD SHOCKLEY 'S now and DEIDRE NEWTON is a homicide prosecutor in NEW YORK , for the Manhattan District Attorney .
So DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER , AND ANOTHER GUY BY THE NAME OF RICHARD WALKER chose ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS to go to AN ALL WHITE ENRICHMENT CLASS AT ELYTON SCHOOL and we were placed there in SIXTH grade .
So TWENTY-FIVE was TWENTY-FIVE then .
There were ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS blacks .
JUST THREE IN THE WHOLE GIFTED CLASS OF TWENTY-FIVE STUDENTS .
Then THE REST OF THE SCHOOL was also all white .
THE REST OF THE SCHOOL was all white THE FIRST YEAR that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went there .
THAT SCHOOL , HER FATHER also had some children that were physically challenged .
Polio , other physical disabilities and MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK started to see some blacks come in in SEPTEMBER OF 1962 also .
By THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was in EIGHTH grade THE SCHOOL was probably fifteen to twenty percent black because THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE was sitting in THE MIDDLE OF A BLACK COMMUNITY .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA used to have to drive PAST TWO ALL WHITE SCHOOLS to get to THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL , because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA lived in an all black community .
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRAYMONT , WHICH IS NOW THE JCC HEADQUARTERS , is THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRAYMONT , WHICH IS NOW THE JCC HEADQUARTERS .
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRAYMONT , WHICH IS NOW THE JCC HEADQUARTERS has been restored , THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRAYMONT , WHICH IS NOW THE JCC HEADQUARTERS is THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRAYMONT , WHICH IS NOW THE JCC HEADQUARTERS , but THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRAYMONT , WHICH IS NOW THE JCC HEADQUARTERS was all white .
After black PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA started moving-let MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA back up and tell MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA lived in an area in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE called DYNAMITE HILL .
Yeah , DYNAMITE HILL 've interviewed A FEW PEOPLE from SEPTEMBER OF 1962 .
Well , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA lived on DYNAMITE HILL .
A FEW PEOPLE were one of the THE FIRST black families to move on OUR BLOCK .
In FACT , PROFESSOR EMERITUS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK there were STILL WHITE FOLKS there .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA remember living THERE AND WHITE PEOPLE coming in THAT NEIGHBORHOOD and vandalizing cars , throwing bricks through PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA windows , burning a cross in MY NEIGHBOR 'S YARD when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA lived on THE FIRST Street .
So , as the complexion of the neighborhood changed-and interestingly enough , that neighborhood borders Birmingham Southern College which at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE was an all white university .
As THAT NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED COLLEGE HILLS , we referred to THAT NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED COLLEGE HILLS as DYNAMITE HILL , but THAT NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED COLLEGE HILLS is really now called COLLEGE HILLS , AS THAT NEIGHBORHOODS ' COMPLEXION CHANGED THEN THE SCHOOLS CHANGED TOO .
Because all the white parents that could started taking THEIR KIDS out of PAST TWO ALL WHITE SCHOOLS and then -LSB- black ? -RSB- STUDENTS THAT HAD GONE TO THESE MORE WELL KNOWN started replacing THEIR KIDS .
What would always happen was that once ONE or TWO blacks started going to a school then in A FEW YEARS ONE became all black , because all the white people who could leave left .
ONE 's commonly called white flight .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA used to go PAST TWO ALL WHITE SCHOOLS to get to THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was in FIFTH grade .
ONE OF THEM was within walking distance of MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA house .
ONE OF THEM was sitting right in the middle of AN ALL BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT POINT IN TIME and ONE OF THEM was still all white .
Do THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION have MEMORIES OF WALKING TO SCHOOL AND WALKING PAST GROUPS OF WHITE KIDS ?
Oh yeah , PAST GROUPS OF WHITE KIDS used to have walk battles with them .
There was a line of demarcation which was GRAYMONT AVENUE , because there also is a very large housing project that 's right across THE STREET FROM LEGION FIELD called ELYTON VILLAGE .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was in FIFTH grade ELYTON VILLAGE was all white , so PAST GROUPS OF WHITE KIDS used to have FIGHTS and organize rock battles with THE WHITE KIDS FROM THE PROJECTS .
FIFTH was like a little demilitarized zone , which was like GRAYMONT AVENUE almost like in Korea .
Or Israel .
Yeah .
THE WHITES would stay on THE WHITES side of GRAYMONT AVENUE and WE would stay on WE side of GRAYMONT AVENUE .
Then as WE started to box THE WHITES in THE PRIVATE HOME OWNERS WERE ABLE TO SELL THEIR HOMES , but THE WHITE FOLKS WHO LIVED IN ELYTON , because THE PRIVATE HOME OWNERS WERE ABLE TO SELL THEIR HOMES was public housing , it was A LOT more difficult for THE WHITES to move .
What MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were left with were the poorest whites who were still going to ELYTON VILLAGE , because all of the whites that lived in private homes left .
So MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had A BAD MIX OF KIDS and WE were left in a school where most of THE WHITE KIDS FROM THE PROJECTS lived in a housing project .
A BAD MIX OF KIDS was A BAD MIX OF KIDS and there were lots of fights and lots of RACIAL RELATED INCIDENTS IN THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .
Would THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION like to tell DYNAMITE HILL in more detail about SOME OF THE INCIDENTS ?
Sure .
The first day that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was in ELYTON SCHOOL , ONE OF THE WHITE KIDS IN THE CLASS called DEIDRE NEWTON A NIGGER and pulled HER HAIR .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got in a fight with A NIGGER ; SOME OF THE INCIDENTS suspended MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA from school .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had to stay home three days .
Came back to school , BOTH MY PARENTS talked to MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA and said , `` Listen , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have got to understand MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK can not react HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ca n't respond HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE , because HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE 's really important .
What BOTH MY PARENTS are trying to do is get MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK put out of school so that BOTH MY PARENTS can prove that THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES ca n't behave properly .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have got to understand that there is A VERY , VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS LIKE TEN YEARS OLD and MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK just have to bite YOUR TONGUE and not say anything , because YOUR TONGUE 's really important that MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK stay in THAT SCHOOL , HER FATHER . ''
A VERY , VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS LIKE TEN YEARS OLD was A VERY , VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS LIKE TEN YEARS OLD .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA just did n't do very well with people getting up in MY FACE and spitting at ME AND STUFF like ME AND STUFF , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did n't take very well to A VERY , VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS LIKE TEN YEARS OLD .
Did BOTH MY PARENTS talk about MY FACE in terms of non-violence or THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT IS AS GOOD ?
A VORACIOUS READER did , A VORACIOUS READER never told MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to let anyone hit MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
A VORACIOUS READER never told MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to absorb punishment .
A VORACIOUS READER said do n't hit anyone THE FIRST .
If somebody hits MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK should definitely defend MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK .
THE FIRST 's not non-violent .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would n't have made THE FIRST in non-violent protests , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA never participated in any of them .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would not have been able to let someone hit MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
THE SPITTING was ONE thing and ONE was bad enough , but THE SPITTING hitting MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would n't have been able to take ONE .
But MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA really could n't take THE SPITTING when DEIDRE NEWTON was physically attacked and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did n't take THE SPITTING very well .
THE OTHER GUY , RICHARD WALKER was KIND OF A PUDGY KID and THE OTHER GUY was very withdrawn and soft spoken and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was THE MORE AGGRESSIVE OF THE THREE .
DEIDRE NEWTON wore glasses and had pig tails and DEIDRE NEWTON was a very , very soft spoken girl-which is why KIND OF A PUDGY KID 's so ironic that DEIDRE NEWTON would end up being a homicide prosecutor .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was really THE MORE AGGRESSIVE OF THE THREE and the more outspoken , and ended up kind of being the spokesperson for ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS .
THE OTHER THING THAT WAS A STRONG FACTOR FOR ME GOING THERE is that THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL did n't like US anyway , because THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL referred to US as the gifted kids with a snide sort of thing .
Because US got stuff that THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL did n't get , US got to go on FIELD TRIPS and US had audio visual aides and stuff like that that THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL did n't have .
So there was an animosity between the regular students in THE SCHOOL and US gifted class .
THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL passed classes , US did n't .
US got to go to THE YOUTH GYMNASIUM by US ; US did n't have to share THE YOUTH GYMNASIUM with other students in THE SCHOOL .
US had access to THE LIBRARY ALL DAY long , and THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL did n't have THE LIBRARY ALL DAY .
US got to go on FIELD TRIPS and have people from the symphony and stuff like that come down and interact with US .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA guess THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL were jealous and reasonably so , because THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL saw US getting resources that THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL did n't have available to THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL .
So , THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION had THE THREAT OF THEM NOT LIKING YOU ANYWAY AND THEN ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU ARE BLACK , THE THREAT OF THEM NOT LIKING YOU ANYWAY AND THEN ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU ARE BLACK would be double -
Sure , sure .
Then , because a lot of THE WHITE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL were poor .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mean , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA remember white kids coming to that school with cardboard in THE WHITE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL shoes .
It was the THE FIRST time MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had ever seen anybody eat a mayonnaise sandwich .
BOTH MY PARENTS were n't wealthy , but BOTH MY PARENTS were both teachers .
WE owned WE own home , WE had TWO cars , WE took vacations ...
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did n't think about OUR OWN HOME at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE , but WE had A LOT more resources then some of the white students in THAT SCHOOL , HER FATHER .
So , there is always A NATURAL ANIMOSITY because of that demographic difference .
It was very , very strange now that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think back on A NATURAL ANIMOSITY .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA thought MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA teacher at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE was a racist and that MY FOURTH-GRADE TEACHER IN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL did n't like THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES .
MY FOURTH-GRADE TEACHER IN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL was very stern and strict .
Later on MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA found out from talking with MY FOURTH-GRADE TEACHER IN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL that MY FOURTH-GRADE TEACHER IN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL had gotten death threats because PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA told MY FOURTH-GRADE TEACHER IN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL MY FOURTH-GRADE TEACHER IN THE ALL BLACK SCHOOL should refuse to teach THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES .
THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE just goes to show that perhaps one of the greatest untold stories of THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT IS AS GOOD is THE WAY PEOPLE - because now a lot of THE BLACK PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT have been recognized , but MANY OF THE WHITES WHO GAVE MONEY AND SUPPORT AND STUFF LIKE THAT never got recognized until stuff like A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK .
A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK really talked A LOT about the role of THE WAY PEOPLE in the Civil Rights Movement-Carry Me Home .
A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK 's A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK , A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK 's A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK , it is the best book .
DIANE MCWHORTER is DIANE MCWHORTER name ; it is absolutely the best book MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have read on the BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE part of THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT IS AS GOOD .
Because DIANE MCWHORTER was from JUST HERE and DIANE MCWHORTER father was an industrialist who participated in THE CITIZEN 'S Council that was responsible for maintaining segregation .
Was DIANE MCWHORTER ?
DIANE MCWHORTER was n't .
DIANE MCWHORTER was a teenager at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE and later on DIANE MCWHORTER found out about DIANE MCWHORTER father 's role .
A LOT OF PEOPLE misunderstand why we got desegregation in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE .
It was n't so much because of THE PROTESTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT , A LOT OF PEOPLE was really because of the boycotts .
THE WHITE BUSINESSES could n't stand not having black customers .
The way BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE is , not so much so now because THE DOWNTOWN AREA has expanded , but where most of THE PROTESTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT were going on at THE SIXTEENTH STREET CHURCH and Kelly Ingram Park was several blocks away from the white part of downtown .
There was a black part of downtown called FOURTH AVENUE , which is where we shopped .
There was only one professional building , the Masonic Temple Building , which is where THE BLACK DOCTORS AND DENTISTS and lawyers and stuff had THE BLACK DOCTORS AND DENTISTS offices all in one building .
There were TWO black movie theatres , The Carver and The Famous , and THE BLACK DOCTORS AND DENTISTS were all within a block of each other .
So , most of THE BLACK BUSINESSES were centralized in sort of a FOUR OF US block area .
Then MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK got to the white part of town .
THE PROTESTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT did n't spill over into SEPTEMBER OF 1962 because if THE BLACK DOCTORS AND DENTISTS did THE WHITE FOLKS WHO LIVED IN ELYTON would have gone to jail .
So THE BLACK DOCTORS AND DENTISTS let MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK march and stuff like that in Kelly Ingram Park for a while until THE CHILDREN OF BLACK FAMILIES started getting involved .
THE BLACK DOCTORS AND DENTISTS was when THE BLACK DOCTORS AND DENTISTS started using THE FIRE HOSES and dogs and THAT KIND OF STUFF .
THAT KIND OF STUFF was really when BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION stopped shopping at white owned stores that THE CITIZEN 'S council got involved , because BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION were taking a very , very serious economic hit .
TOO MANY and dime stores , A LARGE PART OF THEIR BUSINESS was black folk .
When BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION stopped shopping there , THE FIVE was just like in the bus boycott in Montgomery when BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION stopped riding THE BUSES , THE BUSES started going broke .
So THE FIVE was really to some degree for economic reasons that BUSINESSES decided to integrate , not because BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION thought it was THE RIGHT THING TO DO ... because THE RIGHT THING TO DO had always been THE RIGHT THING TO DO .
It just was the pressing thing to do .
Well , and then also again there was A LOT OF PRESSURE PLACED ON WHITE BUSINESSES NOT TO INTEGRATE .
If MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK let BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION try on CLOTHES then A LOT OF PRESSURE PLACED ON WHITE BUSINESSES NOT TO INTEGRATE would get out and MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK would be ostracized by THE MEMBERS or THE WAY PEOPLE would stop shopping at MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK store .
So there was a lot of social pressure from THE WHITE COMMUNITY to force other whites to be racist .
DYNAMITE HILL 'm definitely going to take A LOOK at A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK .
A LOOK 's A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK .
THE ONLY OTHER BOOK THAT I READ ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT IS AS GOOD is A FREEDOM RIDER book .
A FREEDOM RIDER book is much more personal than DIANE MCWHORTER book because JOHN 'S was JOHN 'S , and DIANE MCWHORTER never had those experiences .
DIANE MCWHORTER book is much more of a historical THIRD person account , whereas JOHN 'S book is up close and personal .
A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK 's A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK ; A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK 's so powerful that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA could n't even finish reading A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK .
TOO MANY MEMORIES OF WALKING TO SCHOOL AND WALKING PAST GROUPS OF WHITE KIDS ?
Oh man , when MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK read about THE FREEDOM RIDERS A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK 's just horrible , what happened to THE FREEDOM RIDERS .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mean A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK 's bad enough to be spit on , but A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK 's another thing altogether to be padlocked in a bus and have A TREMENDOUSLY MOVING BOOK be set on fire .
Yeah , when DYNAMITE HILL saw THE BUS HE 'S BEEN IN at the Civil Rights Institute .
THE BUS HE 'S BEEN IN 's THE BUS HE 'S BEEN IN ! MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ought to read DYNAMITE HILL book , THE BUS HE 'S BEEN IN 's powerful .
DYNAMITE HILL talks about people who were THE FREEDOM RIDERS , several of THE FREEDOM RIDERS who are mentally ill now .
One of the guys that was with DYNAMITE HILL and was a Freedom Rider with DYNAMITE HILL got beaten so bad that DYNAMITE HILL is mentally retarded now .
It was just horrible what happened , PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA were disfigured and JOHN 'S was beaten unconscious SEVERAL TIMES .
PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA never happened to MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA never had to take any beatings by police .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got in FIGHTS with other kids , but MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA never got beat by THE POLICE .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got mistreated by police officers a couple of SEVERAL TIMES , but MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA never got beat with night sticks and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA never had any dogs sicced on MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
MY SISTER did , as a protester .
MY SISTER is TEN YEARS older than MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA am and MY SISTER snuck out of school to participate in THE CHILDREN OF BLACK FAMILIES marches .
Did MY SISTER get sent to jail ?
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA do n't know if MY SISTER went to jail , MY SISTER does n't talk about TEN YEARS very much .
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE PART OF THAT do n't talk about A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE PART OF THAT .
Since WE just start with the school 's desegregating , WE really have n't talked with anybody about THE CHILDREN 'S MARCH .
DYNAMITE HILL 'd like to in DYNAMITE HILL own time .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK should , THE CHILDREN 'S MARCH was THE CHILDREN 'S MARCH .
THE CHILDREN 'S MARCH got so bad that THE CHILDREN OF BLACK FAMILIES used Rickwood Field as a holding cell , THE CHILDREN OF BLACK FAMILIES used a baseball stadium to hold YOUR KIDS because YOUR KIDS ran out of jail space .
CONNOR said that CONNOR was n't going to stop arresting THE CHILDREN OF BLACK FAMILIES , so THE CHILDREN OF BLACK FAMILIES just started holding THE CHILDREN OF BLACK FAMILIES in-but Diane McWhorter 's book talks about all of that in detail .
Sometimes THE CHILDREN 'S MARCH just still feels overwhelming to think about all of that .
What 's overwhelming is that THE CHILDREN 'S MARCH was n't THAT LONG ago .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm middle aged , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm FORTY-EIGHT YEARS old and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA remember THE STUFF THAT WAS HAPPENING HERE PEOPLE clearly .
So , FORTY-EIGHT YEARS was n't THAT LONG ago .
THE CITY , WHICH WAS SEVENTY PERCENT BLACK has changed a lot in many ways , and in many ways THE CITY , WHICH WAS SEVENTY PERCENT BLACK has n't changed .
There is no more du jour segregation .
THE THING THAT WAS ODD ABOUT THE SOUTH is JIM CROW .
There was SEGREGATION IN OTHER PLACES , but SEGREGATION IN OTHER PLACES was more custom than by law .
Here for instance , if A WHITE PERSON had allowed a black to eat at a restaurant A WHITE PERSON would have gone to jail , not just been ostracized , which is bad enough .
A WHITE PERSON would have gone to jail , and THEY enforced that here in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE .
BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE was n't like in SOME PLACES when BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE was a wink and a nod , if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK went into a white place and tried to order some food THEY would put MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK in jail .
THE POLICE would come and THEY would put MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK in jail .
THE SUPREME COURT CASE THAT DEALT WITH LOITERING came out of BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE .
FRED SHUTTLESWORTH was FRED SHUTTLESWORTH .
So , THEY would go anytime there were groups of black people talking and ask everybody to prove that THEY had MY FIRST JOBS .
Then what THEY would do if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK proved that MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED AT THE CHURCHES , THEY would go to MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK employer and get MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK fired .
THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED AT THE CHURCHES was THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED AT THE CHURCHES , THE POLICE and the clan would take down everybody 's tag numbers and run THE POLICE AND THE CLAN and find out who MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were .
When THE POLICE AND THE CLAN found out where MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK worked THE POLICE AND THE CLAN would tell THE POLICE AND THE CLAN , and MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK boss would call MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK in and say , `` What were MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK doing at that meeting ? '' and then fire MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK .
-LSB- another person enters-interruption -RSB-
THE POLICE AND THE CLAN talked SOME ABOUT THE REALLY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES YOU HAD IN THE SCHOOLS , but DYNAMITE HILL was wondering about how THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION recovered from PAST TWO ALL WHITE SCHOOLS ? What comfort did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION have when THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION went back home ?
It was n't anything that-I do n't feel permanently stigmatized by SOME ABOUT THE REALLY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES YOU HAD IN THE SCHOOLS , not did MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA feel permanently stigmatized by SOME ABOUT THE REALLY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES YOU HAD IN THE SCHOOLS at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE .
We had a lot of very strong black institutions .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was fortunate to have BOTH OF MY PARENTS until A VORACIOUS READER died in 1974 , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had AN OLDER SISTER WHO HAD DONE VERY WELL IN SCHOOL .
BOTH OF MY PARENTS graduated from high school and got A SCHOLARSHIP to Talladega when BOTH OF MY PARENTS was sixteen years old .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have younger sisters who have done well also .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mom had several sisters and brothers that lived here in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had lots of cousins .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to a very active and vibrant church and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had LOTS OF FRIENDS in THE WHITE COMMUNITY , so MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had a very , very strong support network .
To some degree many of MONEY AND SUPPORT AND STUFF LIKE THAT networks have deteriorated because of integration .
THE BLACK COMMUNITY had A LOT more pressure to be supportive of each other at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE of THE BLACK BUSINESSES , being supportive of BLACK CHURCHES , because MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK did n't have any other options-you could n't integrate .
If MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK needed a doctor MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had to go to a black doctor because a white doctor would n't treat MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK .
If MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK needed a dentist or a lawyer MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had to go to BLACK PROFESSIONALS , and so WE had a thriving black professional community here .
WE had A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM before desegregation than WE do now .
JUST HERE 's not JUST HERE , A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM 's A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM .
DYNAMITE HILL could tell that by observation , just driving around .
Had A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM not been for some of the historical efforts that have taken place in the FOURTH AVENUE area , it would be much more run-down than A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM is now .
A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM had fallen into just a prostitution and drug strip many years ago , until some people that had A SENSE OF THE HISTORICAL IMPACT OF THAT AREA went in and tried to save A SENSE OF THE HISTORICAL IMPACT OF THAT AREA .
DYNAMITE HILL did n't know A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM had gotten that bad .
A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM was bad , A MUCH MORE THRIVING BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM was bad .
It was n't even safe to walk in THE DOWNTOWN AREA ?
There were PROSTITUTES WALKING THE STREET , openly .
Can THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION think of any good experiences at ELYTON VILLAGE that THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION would like to share ?
Oh , LOTS OF FRIENDS .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA made some people that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE with .
A guy MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA met in AN ALL WHITE ENRICHMENT CLASS AT ELYTON SCHOOL named Barry Norris , who MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA still talk to HER NOW .
In fact BARRY is BARRY .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA still consider BARRY to be BARRY .
Some of the other students in AN ALL WHITE ENRICHMENT CLASS AT ELYTON SCHOOL , in fact ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS or FOUR OF US went to INDIAN SPRINGS together .
Again , THE RACISM THAT WAS GOING ON HERE was governmental and THE RACISM THAT WAS GOING ON HERE was being perpetuated by a small part of THE WHITE COMMUNITY .
A SOCIAL COMPACT did n't agree with A SOCIAL COMPACT and a lot blacks did n't , but everybody was caught up in A SOCIAL COMPACT because A SOCIAL COMPACT was enforced by law .
A SOCIAL COMPACT was n't just A SOCIAL COMPACT , A SOCIAL COMPACT was enforced by law .
Also , THE WHITES would have been ostracized if THE WHITES tried to interact with THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES .
One of the white girls named Kay Cretcher who went to THAT SCHOOL , HER FATHER was A LIBERAL .
A VORACIOUS READER was one of the THE FIRST grown men MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA knew that wore a pony tail .
A LIBERAL had a bookstore on the south side here in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE .
DEIDRE NEWTON was DEIDRE NEWTON in THE CLASS TO BEFRIEND DEIDRE , because at least RICHARD SHOCKLEY 'S and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had each other , DEIDRE NEWTON was DEIDRE NEWTON .
KAY was THE FIRST GIRL IN THE CLASS TO BEFRIEND DEIDRE .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA remember the last day of school after the SIXTH grade , SOME STUDENTS grabbed KAY and threw THE FIRST GIRL IN THE CLASS TO BEFRIEND DEIDRE down on the ground and cut HER HAIR .
THE FIRST GIRL IN THE CLASS TO BEFRIEND DEIDRE had ALMOST WAIST LENGTH HAIR , and SOME STUDENTS cut HER HAIR for being DEIDRE NEWTON friend .
ALMOST WAIST LENGTH HAIR was terrible .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA still communicate with another guy named Keith Sides who is a Vice President of a local bank who is right across THE STREET FROM LEGION FIELD now , working for AmSouth Bank .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have been in touch with META AYERS .
As A MATTER OF FACT MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ran into MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 , the summer after MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA graduated HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW THAT FALL .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had not seen MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA recognized MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 and hugged MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 and thanked MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 because MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 gave us all a tremendous education .
MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 was MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA told MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was giving the youth sermon at A CHURCH , and MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 told MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 would come and MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 did .
MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 came there and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA introduced MRS. AYERS AT A SHOPPING MALL IN 1981 to A LOT OF PEOPLE at A CHURCH and A CHURCH was a very moving HIS EXPERIENCE .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA guess A LOT OF PEOPLE was in June of 1981 , which at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE was ELEVEN YEARS after MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had gotten out of THE CLASS TO BEFRIEND DEIDRE .
DYNAMITE HILL can tell A VERY , VERY GOOD TEACHER was A VERY , VERY GOOD TEACHER , everybody went on to A REALLY GOOD CAREER .
Oh sure , A VERY , VERY GOOD TEACHER had some good students too , but A VERY , VERY GOOD TEACHER was also A VERY , VERY GOOD TEACHER .
A REALLY GOOD CAREER was something being part of integration , because what integration ultimately did , THE BLACK PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT were THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
All the black public schools were not THE SAME .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had SOME BLACK SCHOOLS THAT HAD VERY , VERY GOOD TEACHERS AND A VERY ACTIVE PTA AND THE LEVEL OF INSTRUCTION and the level of learning was much higher than at some of the other black schools .
There 's going to be a pecking order in anything .
BOTH MY PARENTS were BOTH GRADUATES OF PARKER HIGH SCHOOL , WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE BEST BLACK HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
In FACT AT ONE TIME FACT AT ONE TIME had more students than any other public high school in THE UNITED STATES , NINETY PERCENT OF THEM THE MAN .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mother went to PARKER THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS went in shifts .
DYNAMITE HILL 've heard about THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
TWO shifts a day .
TWO was called Industrial High School at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE .
Both of BOTH MY PARENTS graduated from PARKER .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mother moved to BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE because there were SOME BLACK SCHOOLS THAT HAD VERY , VERY GOOD TEACHERS AND A VERY ACTIVE PTA AND THE LEVEL OF INSTRUCTION beyond the SIXTH grade for blacks in Sumter County which is where A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER grew up .
A VORACIOUS READER came in from Sylacauga County for THE SAME REASON .
So MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had some very , very good experiences and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm not bitter about THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEN TRANSLATE INTO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had with PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have bitterness because of the institutionalization of THE RACISM THAT WAS GOING ON HERE , and the fact that from A GOVERNMENTAL STANDPOINT we did n't do anything about A GOVERNMENTAL STANDPOINT sooner .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ca n't change THE WAY PEOPLE relate to each other , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ca n't legislate decency .
But MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK can legislate things like fair spending for BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS , like public accommodations and public transportation .
Services like sewer and gutter and trash pick ups were always worse in THE BLACK AREAS than THE WAY PEOPLE were in THE WHITE AREAS .
THE POLICE PROTECTION and the fire protection were always worse in THE BLACK AREAS than THE POLICE PROTECTION was in THE WHITE AREAS .
THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT I AM BITTER ABOUT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT are THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT I AM BITTER ABOUT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT .
THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT I AM BITTER ABOUT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT was wrong .
BOTH MY PARENTS worked and BOTH MY PARENTS paid taxes , BOTH MY PARENTS paid the same taxes that any white person paid that made THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY , and so BOTH MY PARENTS access to governmental services should have been THE SAME ... and THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY was n't .
Do THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION think that the discrepancy was worse in terms of residential or in terms of keeping up PAST TWO ALL WHITE SCHOOLS ?
The residential discrepancies changed immediately , because once BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION started moving into white neighborhoods THE WHITE FOLKS WHO LIVED IN ELYTON left .
A black person would move onto a block and all the white people would have for sale signs in MY NEIGHBOR 'S YARD .
Before THEN there were unspoken agreements from real estate agents not to even show houses in certain areas to THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES .
So , THEN was HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE that THEN really controlled HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE .
Or , if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK went to A BANK FOR FINANCING THEN would n't finance MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were trying to buy in a certain area .
A BANK FOR FINANCING was HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE that A BANK FOR FINANCING was controlled .
THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM was residentially integrated long before THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM was institutionally integrated .
When MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK look at things like the police department and THE FIRE DEPARTMENT and the opportunity for THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES to work as COUNTY EMPLOYEES FOR INSTANCE , COUNTY EMPLOYEES FOR INSTANCE lagged way behind the residential integration .
In fact now , in many of our institutions like COUNTY GOVERNMENT FOR INSTANCE , the majority of COUNTY EMPLOYEES FOR INSTANCE are white .
In CITY GOVERNMENT there is A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF WHITES COMPARED TO THE POPULATION , not that there should be a direct correlation or that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm saying there should be quotas , but CITY GOVERNMENT should be representative and CITY GOVERNMENT 's not .
So what effect does THIS have on people besides just the practical things of not having reliable services in THIS homes , does CITY GOVERNMENT have some kind of psychological effect ?
What CITY GOVERNMENT did is CITY GOVERNMENT caused A LOT OF PEOPLE to move .
CITY GOVERNMENT was why MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA left , because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA thought that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did n't have a future here .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA left to go to college , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA told MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mother MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA am never coming back here .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm never coming back , A RACIST PLACE is A RACIST PLACE , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA do n't think MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have any opportunities here , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm not going to be able to succeed in the good old boy network because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA will never be MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm black .
THE BEST HIGH SCHOOL FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF KID and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm never coming back here .
MANY OF MY MOTHER 'S FRIENDS , MANY OF MY PARENT 'S FRIENDS left .
MANY OF MY MOTHER 'S FRIENDS , MANY OF MY PARENT 'S FRIENDS left and MANY OF MY MOTHER 'S FRIENDS , MANY OF MY PARENT 'S FRIENDS went to CHICAGO , MANY OF MY MOTHER 'S FRIENDS , MANY OF MY PARENT 'S FRIENDS went to CLEVELAND and MANY OF MY MOTHER 'S FRIENDS , MANY OF MY PARENT 'S FRIENDS went to DETROIT .
MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA God parents , moved to DETROIT because MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND AND MY GOD PARENTS had Master 's degrees and MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND AND MY GOD PARENTS were making less than WHITE TEACHERS THAT WERE RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mother went to teach at West End High School , A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER had a Master 's degree and A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER was working as a subordinate to A WHITE COACH THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE A COLLEGE degree , and making LESS MONEY .
We have JUDGES IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA THAT ARE NOT EVEN LAWYERS .
In SOME RURAL COMMUNITIES , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK can be a probate judge without even being a lawyer in THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA still practice now in A LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES and when MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK go out to SOME RURAL COMMUNITIES MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK find that A LOT OF THINGS have n't changed .
JUDGES IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA THAT ARE NOT EVEN LAWYERS 're still basically segregated , A LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES 's not JIM CROW du jour segregation but A LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES 's still segregated in fact .
So on THE BOOKS THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN MATTERS MORE THAN EDUCATION , or JUDGES IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA THAT ARE NOT EVEN LAWYERS just do n't even factor education in to the job requirements ?
What happens is that BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION here used education as a means of escaping .
BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION just did n't see EQUIVALENT OPPORTUNITIES here .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'll give MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK A PERFECT EXAMPLE , MANY OF THE BLACK LAWYERS THAT I KNOW THAT WENT TO LAW SCHOOL PRIOR TO 1970-THEY did n't want to integrate THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA LAW SCHOOL , so MANY OF THE BLACK LAWYERS THAT I KNOW THAT WENT TO LAW SCHOOL PRIOR TO 1970-THEY would pay for MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK to go to HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW THAT FALL out of state .
MANY OF THE BLACK LAWYERS THAT I KNOW THAT WENT TO LAW SCHOOL PRIOR TO 1970-THEY 'd pay MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK tuition , MANY OF THE BLACK LAWYERS THAT I KNOW THAT WENT TO LAW SCHOOL PRIOR TO 1970-THEY 'd pay MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK room and board , MANY OF THE BLACK LAWYERS THAT I KNOW THAT WENT TO LAW SCHOOL PRIOR TO 1970-THEY 'd pay for MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK housing and MANY OF THE BLACK LAWYERS THAT I KNOW THAT WENT TO LAW SCHOOL PRIOR TO 1970-THEY 'd pay for MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK books .
The only other option was to have a black law school .
If MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK wanted to go to medical school and MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK applied to THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA , MANY OF THE BLACK LAWYERS THAT I KNOW THAT WENT TO LAW SCHOOL PRIOR TO 1970-THEY would pay for MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK to go to Meharry or some other black medical school rather than to have to set up a black state medical school .
Up until A TREMENDOUS THING , if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK graduated from THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK did n't have to take THE BIRMINGHAM BAR , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were automatically admitted .
When A TREMENDOUS THING integrated that changed .
A TREMENDOUS THING 's A TREMENDOUS THING , because a lot of THE WHITE FOLKS WHO LIVED IN ELYTON never pass THE BIRMINGHAM BAR .
Hmmm .
BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME are BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME .
Oh , sure .
Well , THEY moved THE FENCE .
THE FENCE was exactly THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED AT THE CHURCHES with the voting rights act cases , where MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK would come in and MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK would have to take a citizenship test in order to vote .
THEY did n't make STILL WHITE FOLKS do THEY .
THEY had black folks coming in there , many of whom were relatively uneducated and many instances SOME OF THEM were illiterate and SOME OF THEM would ask detailed questions about THE CONSTITUTION THAT EVEN A LAW PROFESSOR CA N'T ANSWER .
Then THEY would use that as AN INSULT TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT GOT BEAT DOWN , SHOT , LYNCHED when THEY did n't know enough about THE CONSTITUTION THAT EVEN A LAW PROFESSOR CA N'T ANSWER .
When THEY did n't work , THEY just put THESE GUYS up there with baseball bats ... which usually worked .
AN INSULT TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT GOT BEAT DOWN , SHOT , LYNCHED 's one thing that makes MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA so angry now , about BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION .
If BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION realized what WE went through to get to vote , BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION would realize that AN INSULT TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT GOT BEAT DOWN , SHOT , LYNCHED 's AN INSULT TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT GOT BEAT DOWN , SHOT , LYNCHED and THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROUPED INTO THE HISPANIC CATEGORY DO N'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH just ca n't get up off THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROUPED INTO THE HISPANIC CATEGORY DO N'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH asses to go vote .
There is NO EXCUSE FOR IT .
There is absolutely NO EXCUSE FOR IT , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA just do n't understand NO EXCUSE FOR IT .
WE have elections here and a high turn out might be thirty-eight percent .
The national turnout is like just shy of fifty percent .
Yeah but in ALABAMA THE BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT .
MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE are old enough to remember what happened .
MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE 's true .
And if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK remember what ALABAMA THE BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT . was like JUST HERE before 1965 there is no excuse for MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK not voting .
Maybe JUST HERE still have that sense that JUST HERE votes wo n't change THE GOVERNMENT THAT HAS BEEN SO UNRESPONSIVE BEFORE .
Well , apathy has settled in and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA go back to DR. JULIUS WILSON theories .
Even though MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA do n't agree with A LOT OF THINGS that DR. JULIUS WILSON says , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA thought this was just so much on point .
DR. JULIUS WILSON talked about what happened during segregation , DR. JULIUS WILSON said MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had A MUCH MORE COHESIVE BLACK COMMUNITY WHERE YOU HAD BLACK PROFESSIONALS AND BLACK PEOPLE OF WEALTH LIVING IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES AS BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION .
So BLACK PROFESSIONALS had THE ROLE MODELS THAT USED TO BE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY NO LONGER .
Now what has happened to a large degree is that - MY WIFE and MY WIFE live in VESTAVIA .
WE 're the only black couple on WE block .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm not MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA and MY WIFE is not the only architect on WE block .
So , OUR BLOCK 's much more class related than OUR BLOCK was racially related .
Now , not only are MY WIFE , but A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK INNER CITY 's also predominantly poor .
So POOR PEOPLE , not always , but POOR PEOPLE tend to be less educated .
If MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK are less educated and poor , there is a higher likelihood that YOUR CHILDREN will be less educated and poor .
And then THE ONES WHO GET EDUCATED AND ARE NOT POOR LEAVE , BECAUSE THEY CAN .
THE ONES WHO GET EDUCATED AND ARE NOT POOR LEAVE , BECAUSE THEY CAN assume EQUIVALENT OPPORTUNITIES are somewhere else .
Well THE ONES WHO GET EDUCATED AND ARE NOT POOR LEAVE , BECAUSE THEY CAN are , THE ONES WHO GET EDUCATED AND ARE NOT POOR LEAVE , BECAUSE THEY CAN want the American dream and THE ONES WHO GET EDUCATED AND ARE NOT POOR LEAVE , BECAUSE THEY CAN do n't want to be trapped in AN INNER CITY where the crime is going up and the social services are deteriorating .
WE got BLACK MAYORS in a lot of black cities because THE WHITE FOLKS WHO LIVED IN ELYTON left , not because WE out voted BLACK MAYORS , BLACK MAYORS left .
So there is A LOT OF POLITICAL ANIMOSITY BETWEEN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES and A LOT OF POLITICAL ANIMOSITY BETWEEN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES 's destroying WE communities .
One of the reasons that WE ca n't progress is that WE do n't have any regional cooperation for things like transportation .
WHENEVER WE try to get regional transportation WHENEVER WE is perceived as being an opportunity for THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES to get to THE SUBURBS and THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES vote against WHENEVER WE .
WE had a voter sponsored initiative here in the spring of 1998 RIGHT after MY WIFE and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA moved here , called MAPS-metropolitan area progress or something like 1998 RIGHT , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA forget what the acronym was .
. . LESS MONEY was to be used for regional transportation and having entertainment being in downtown .
PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA voted LESS MONEY down .
The people in THE CITY , WHICH WAS SEVENTY PERCENT BLACK overwhelmingly supported THE CITY , WHICH WAS SEVENTY PERCENT BLACK .
The people in THE SUBURBS were opposed to THE CITY , WHICH WAS SEVENTY PERCENT BLACK .
Do THE SUBURBS always tend to swing THEIR VOTES here ?
Absolutely .
Up until A FEW YEARS ago , WE had never had a black elected to county wide office .
Chris McNair , who 's the father of one of the FOUR OF US little girls that got killed in THE SIXTEENTH STREET CHURCH was the THE FIRST black elected to county wide office in BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
In THE 1980 'S BEFORE WE had a black elected to state wide office , post-Reconstruction .
DYNAMITE HILL guess THE 1980 'S BEFORE 's because more PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA were voting then .
If MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were an educated black person in the early 1960s here , it was just a tremendous push to leave .
What were MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK going to do ? The only thing MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK could do was teach , cut hair , or try to open a little business .
A lot of things that are available to us now , professions like fire , police , public safety , and law enforcement were not open to THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES .
There was n't going to be a black policeman under Bull Connor .
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT was THE FIRE DEPARTMENT .
COUNTY GOVERNMENT FOR INSTANCE , which is one of the largest employers in THE STATE , THAT WAS N'T HERE .
The steel plants , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK could work there but MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were basically restricted to being laborers .
So , if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were SOME PARENTS and YOUR KIDS got a college degree , why would MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK want YOUR KIDS to stay here ? There was nothing for SOME PARENTS to do unless SOME PARENTS wanted to teach .
How early did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION decide THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION were going to leave ?
Probably when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was about nine .
Well , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was n't going to go to THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had BAD EXPERIENCES with THEM working at THEIR HOME FOOTBALL GAMES .
When the UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI , Ole Miss used to come here to play there band used to play Dixie at A TREMENDOUS THING would wave confederate flags .
UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI was accepted , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was like MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm getting the hell out of JUST HERE as soon as MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA can .
So , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got a chance to go to PRINCETON .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to PRINCETON MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got an opportunity to meet BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION from more progressive areas of THE COUNTRY and PRINCETON made MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA realize that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was n't ready to come back here .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA changed A LOT and THE CITY , WHICH WAS SEVENTY PERCENT BLACK changed A LOT , and it was the combination of those TWO transformations that allowed MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to be able to live here .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA stayed away from BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE for-I left in 1974 , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA moved back in 1997 .
And now THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION feel like THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION 're ready to be back ?
MY FIRST TIME ON AN AIRPLANE .
THE CITY , WHICH WAS SEVENTY PERCENT BLACK has changed A LOT .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mean , WE still have A LOT OF WORK to do but A LOT OF WORK has changed A LOT .
WE have a black mayor , WE 've had black mayors for the past twenty years .
WE have A BLACK FIRE CHIEF , A BLACK POLICE CHIEF , AND SEVERAL BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would have never thought that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would have THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mean when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA grew up A BLACK FIRE CHIEF , A BLACK POLICE CHIEF , AND SEVERAL BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES did n't even have THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA now , and so THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER have changed A LOT in a relatively short period of THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE .
From A HISTORICAL STANDPOINT , about half of my life , but from A HISTORICAL STANDPOINT twenty-five years is not very long .
A HISTORICAL STANDPOINT 's A HISTORICAL STANDPOINT , because PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA will think A HISTORICAL STANDPOINT 's long and then PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA 'll think that PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA do n't need to know about how THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER were - -LSB- person speaking interrupts conversation -RSB- back when SUBURBAN SCHOOLS were desegregated because THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER ca n't possibly apply anymore .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK absolutely need to know A HISTORICAL STANDPOINT .
Not just from the standpoint of being informed , but A HISTORICAL STANDPOINT allows MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK to understand the institutions that still survive .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was reading a story recently in the Wall Street Journal about how Morgan Stanley and several other investment banks found out that A BLACK FIRE CHIEF , A BLACK POLICE CHIEF , AND SEVERAL BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES got started because of investments in SLAVES .
So MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have institutions that have institutional wealth still in ALMOST EVERY DAY .
Not just the exploitation of labor , but slavery .
Clear profits from slavery ?
Sure .
Buying and selling of SLAVES .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ought to read about convict labor .
PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA will blow YOUR MIND , because what happened was that THE MINES MORE SO THAN ANYTHING ELSE , TO SOME DEGREE THE STEEL MILLS , but the mines used to have arrangements with the Alabama Department of Corrections to get prisoners to work in THE MINES MORE SO THAN ANYTHING ELSE , TO SOME DEGREE THE STEEL MILLS for free .
DYNAMITE HILL 've heard some stories about YOUR MIND .
Horrible .
Horrible , PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA were dying .
Not only were PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA not getting paid , but PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA were dying in THE MINES MORE SO THAN ANYTHING ELSE , TO SOME DEGREE THE STEEL MILLS .
If THE MINES MORE SO THAN ANYTHING ELSE , TO SOME DEGREE THE STEEL MILLS needed additional work PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA would just go round up some brothers and put PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA in jail on some trumped up CHARGES , then let PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA go work in THE MINES MORE SO THAN ANYTHING ELSE , TO SOME DEGREE THE STEEL MILLS until PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA need for work went down .
Then PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA would let PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA out .
PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA was worse than slavery because at least slaves were given a place to live .
Yeah , THESE GUYS were just worked like ANIMALS .
UH huh , THESE GUYS were worked like ANIMALS and THESE GUYS were in jail for completely trumped up CHARGES .
UH 's horrible , UH is one of the worst black eyes in the history of THE STATE , THAT WAS N'T HERE .
In MY VIEW MY VIEW is even worse than THE FIRE HOSES , MY VIEW is worse than THE POLICE DOGS , nothing is worse than bombing of BLACK CHURCHES , but MY VIEW is SECOND to BLACK CHURCHES .
That a state agency would incarcerate PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA .
There was A LITTLE EXHIBIT ABOUT THAT UP IN VULCAN THAT I SAW ON MONDAY , BUT YEAH , just A LITTLE EXHIBIT ABOUT THAT UP IN VULCAN THAT I SAW ON MONDAY , BUT YEAH .
And then MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have THE SAME COMPANIES WHO BENEFITED FROM THAT , LIKE THE MCWANES FOR INSTANCE , THAT ARE STILL POLLUTING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY .
THE SAME COMPANIES WHO BENEFITED FROM THAT , LIKE THE MCWANES FOR INSTANCE , THAT ARE STILL POLLUTING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY just got convicted of A LITTLE EXHIBIT ABOUT THAT UP IN VULCAN THAT I SAW ON MONDAY , BUT YEAH LAST WEEK .
For spewing polluted water into ELYTON VILLAGE , A WATERWAY THAT RUNS RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM is A WATERWAY THAT RUNS RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN BIRMINGHAM .
THE SAME COMPANIES WHO BENEFITED FROM THAT , LIKE THE MCWANES FOR INSTANCE , THAT ARE STILL POLLUTING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY would have never done that in VESTAVIA .
Yeah , because THE SAME COMPANIES WHO BENEFITED FROM THAT , LIKE THE MCWANES FOR INSTANCE , THAT ARE STILL POLLUTING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY would have gotten caught .
Sure .
Let THE SAME COMPANIES WHO BENEFITED FROM THAT , LIKE THE MCWANES FOR INSTANCE , THAT ARE STILL POLLUTING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY talk a bit about INDIAN SPRINGS .
INDIAN SPRINGS -LSB- HIGH SCHOOL -RSB- was INDIAN SPRINGS -LSB- HIGH SCHOOL -RSB- , INDIAN SPRINGS -LSB- HIGH SCHOOL -RSB- was started in 1957 by A GUY NAMED HARVEY WOODWARD , WHO OWNED WOODWARD COAL AND IRON .
A GUY NAMED HARVEY WOODWARD , WHO OWNED WOODWARD COAL AND IRON gave MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think it was seventeen million dollars which was back when a million dollars was really still a million dollars .
THE SAME COMPANIES WHO BENEFITED FROM THAT , LIKE THE MCWANES FOR INSTANCE , THAT ARE STILL POLLUTING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY bought SEVEN HUNDRED acres of land down in Shelby County and SEVEN HUNDRED was set up as A TRUST .
All the students in THE SCHOOL had to be WHITE ANGLO-SAXON PROTESTANTS from below THE MASON-DIXON LINE and all the teachers in THE SCHOOL had to be WHITE ANGLO-SAXON PROTESTANTS from above THE MASON-DIXON LINE .
All the teachers had to live on campus .
At THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE it was AN ALL BOARDING SCHOOL AND THE STUDENTS WERE REQUIRED TO WORK , AN ALL BOARDING SCHOOL AND THE STUDENTS WERE REQUIRED TO WORK had a farm and horses and all that stuff back in the 1950 's .
AN ALL BOARDING SCHOOL AND THE STUDENTS WERE REQUIRED TO WORK had A CIRCULATING BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF I think seven or eight , wherever A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF WHITES COMPARED TO THE POPULATION was , THE MEMBERS would go off in staggered terms so that THE MEMBERS 'd allow THE MEMBERS to re-elect EACH OTHER so that EACH OTHER was a constantly cycled group of people .
A CIRCULATING BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF I required a unanimous vote of THE BOARD TO DESEGREGATE THE SCHOOL .
So MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think it was 1968 WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST CATHOLIC AND JEWISH STUDENTS , AND THEN IN 1969 THEY GOT THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS .
1968 WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST CATHOLIC AND JEWISH STUDENTS , AND THEN IN 1969 THEY GOT THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS 's 1968 WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST CATHOLIC AND JEWISH STUDENTS , AND THEN IN 1969 THEY GOT THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS , at the time 1968 WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST CATHOLIC AND JEWISH STUDENTS , AND THEN IN 1969 THEY GOT THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS was in THE COUNTRY , but now 1968 WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST CATHOLIC AND JEWISH STUDENTS , AND THEN IN 1969 THEY GOT THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS 's on 119 which is a pretty well developed area .
On the back side of 1968 WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST CATHOLIC AND JEWISH STUDENTS , AND THEN IN 1969 THEY GOT THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS is Oak Mountain State Park .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went there on scholarship .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA met A WHITE COACH THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE A COLLEGE , and one of the teachers there went to THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA met THEM through THE BLACK AND WHITE Together Group that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was with in A CHURCH .
THEM met ME AND STUFF talked to BOTH MY PARENTS and in fact Coach FRED CAMERON developed a friendship with A VORACIOUS READER because A HIGH SCHOOL COACH was also A HIGH SCHOOL COACH .
Coach FRED CAMERON was a basketball coach down there , and so THEM became FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE and talked and FRED CAMERON asked BOTH MY PARENTS to let MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA take THE P.S.A.T. , THE PRELIMINARY SCHOOL ADMISSIONS TEST , or whatever THE PRELIMINARY SCHOOL ADMISSIONS TEST was-it 's the test MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK take to go to PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA took THE PRELIMINARY SCHOOL ADMISSIONS TEST and scored in the ninety-seven percentiles nationally .
As a result of THE PRELIMINARY SCHOOL ADMISSIONS TEST , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got contacted from prep schools all over the country-Andover and Choate and Exeter and all those schools .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went down to INDIAN SPRINGS and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA and BOTH MY PARENTS got the opportunity to meet Dr. Armstrong , who was the headmaster at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE .
BOTH MY PARENTS talked to us about the background of THE SCHOOL and that BOTH MY PARENTS really wanted some black students to integrate that school .
In fact , A PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA is A PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA .
THE NAME OF DEIDRE NEWTON is Julius Scott .
DYNAMITE HILL do n't think DYNAMITE HILL have met A PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA .
JULIUS SHERROD SCOTT .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think JULIUS SHERROD SCOTT . 's JULIUS SHERROD SCOTT . , if JULIUS SHERROD SCOTT . is n't there JULIUS SHERROD SCOTT . left in the last ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS or four years .
DYNAMITE HILL 'll look MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA up when DYNAMITE HILL get back .
Yep , we called DYNAMITE HILL Scotty Scott .
DYNAMITE HILL graduated from INDIAN SPRINGS in 1973 .
The other black graduate that year was a guy by THE NAME OF DEIDRE NEWTON of James Montgomery , who is now a tax lawyer in WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .
A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY was A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY .
A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY went in THE MILITARY , went to Rice , and went in THE MILITARY in ROTC .
A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY killed MY WIFE in A DOMESTIC RELATED DISPUTE , got on AN AIRPLANE , confessed A DOMESTIC RELATED DISPUTE to the stewardess and THEY turned THE PLANE around and flew A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY back-he was trying to leave THE COUNTRY - THEY turned THE PLANE around and A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY surrendered A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY at the airport .
A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY 's been in prison since THEN .
THEN 's awful .
A DOMESTIC RELATED DISPUTE is awful .
It is awful , because A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY is A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY .
A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY only went there for two years .
A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY came there from Woodberry Forest , which is a very exclusive prep school in VIRGINIA .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA liked INDIAN SPRINGS , INDIAN SPRINGS changed MY LIFE .
INDIAN SPRINGS really did .
THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION heard about INDIAN SPRINGS from THE TEENAGERS IN THE CHURCH PROGRAM , but when THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION took THE P.S.A.T. did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION feel any interest in going to any of those other prep schools ?
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did , but BOTH MY PARENTS were not inclined to let MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA go out of state .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went down to INDIAN SPRINGS MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA fell in love with INDIAN SPRINGS , because INDIAN SPRINGS 's just 1968 WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST CATHOLIC AND JEWISH STUDENTS , AND THEN IN 1969 THEY GOT THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS .
BOTH MY PARENTS have lakes and beavers and deer and THE TEENAGERS IN THE CHURCH PROGRAM used to fish and hunt doves on the school grounds and stuff like - INDIAN SPRINGS was like moving to summer camp .
Also , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was away from home and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA enjoyed boarding but MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was close enough to come home on WEEKENDS if MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA wanted to .
INDIAN SPRINGS was only twenty five or thirty miles away .
BOTH MY PARENTS were very comfortable with INDIAN SPRINGS and BOTH MY PARENTS were also very comfortable with THE SCHOOL because BOTH MY PARENTS knew the Camerons .
BOTH MY PARENTS had known BOTH MY PARENTS , not just individually , but collectively through church and for a number of years .
BOTH MY PARENTS knew BOTH MY PARENTS the entire three years that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was at ELYTON VILLAGE .
THE OTHER THING THAT WAS A STRONG FACTOR FOR ME GOING THERE was that ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS other guys that were in MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA EIGHTH grade class went there .
Yeah , THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION mentioned that before .
So , THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION had all talked about going there ?
Sure , and WE had been down there to visit and THREE OTHER GUYS THAT WERE IN MY EIGHTH GRADE CLASS brought WE down there for interviews .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA used to love to sing , and THREE OTHER GUYS THAT WERE IN MY EIGHTH GRADE CLASS had MOUNTAIN BROOK COUNTRY CLUB .
WE glee club went to EUROPE when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was in MY JUNIOR YEAR .
THREE OTHER GUYS THAT WERE IN MY EIGHTH GRADE CLASS had gone to Russia MY JUNIOR YEAR before MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA came there .
WE participated in a national choral competition and won THE FIRST place in KANSAS CITY when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
WE went to NEW YORK MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA freshman MY JUNIOR YEAR to sing .
WE sang with the Vienna Boys Choir when WE were in Vienna .
Wow .
Was that YOUR FIRST TIME OUT OF THE COUNTRY ?
MY FIRST TIME ON AN AIRPLANE .
MY FIRST TIME ON AN AIRPLANE was MY FIRST TIME ON AN AIRPLANE .
The THE FIRST airplane flight MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA took was from Atlanta to Frankfurt , that was MY FIRST TIME ON AN AIRPLANE .
THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION got A LONG FLIGHT , really long one for YOUR FIRST TIME OUT OF THE COUNTRY .
Yeah , A LONG FLIGHT was A LONG FLIGHT .
A LONG FLIGHT must 've been kind of scary .
Yeah , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA remember MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mother giving MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA money and putting A LONG FLIGHT in a handkerchief and pinning A LONG FLIGHT to the inside of MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA pants .
Yeah , DYNAMITE HILL parents gave DYNAMITE HILL those kinds of tips too .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA loved INDIAN SPRINGS and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got a tremendous education there .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got to PRINCETON and got an opportunity to be in classes and stuff like THAT WITH STUDENTS THAT HAD GONE TO THESE MORE WELL KNOWN AND MORE PRESTIGIOUS PREP SCHOOLS , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA never felt that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA met anybody that had a better high school education .
And THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION are still on THE BOARD TO DESEGREGATE THE SCHOOL ?
Yeah , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm on THE ALUMNI COUNCIL there .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA actively help THAT WITH STUDENTS THAT HAD GONE TO THESE MORE WELL KNOWN AND MORE PRESTIGIOUS PREP SCHOOLS to try and recruit and raise money .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA helped in A GREAT , GREAT SCHOOL .
A GREAT , GREAT SCHOOL 's A GREAT , GREAT SCHOOL .
When THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION got there , did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION hang out with THE OTHER GUYS FROM YOUR SCHOOL ?
To some degree MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did , but THE OTHER GUYS FROM YOUR SCHOOL ... MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was really into athletics when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was at INDIAN SPRINGS , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA played basketball , soccer and ran track .
Also , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had A BLACK ROOMMATE WHO WAS FROM HOUSTON , TEXAS , WHO IS NOW A CHEMIST ALSO , LIVING IN HOUSTON .
A VERY , VERY BRIGHT GUY developed a real close friendship because A BLACK ROOMMATE WHO WAS FROM HOUSTON , TEXAS , WHO IS NOW A CHEMIST ALSO , LIVING IN HOUSTON was a long way from home .
So when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would come home on WEEKENDS A BLACK ROOMMATE WHO WAS FROM HOUSTON , TEXAS , WHO IS NOW A CHEMIST ALSO , LIVING IN HOUSTON would come with MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA so that A BLACK ROOMMATE WHO WAS FROM HOUSTON , TEXAS , WHO IS NOW A CHEMIST ALSO , LIVING IN HOUSTON could go to church and get A BLACK ROOMMATE WHO WAS FROM HOUSTON , TEXAS , WHO IS NOW A CHEMIST ALSO , LIVING IN HOUSTON hair cut .
We developed a real strong friendship .
There was ANOTHER GUY THAT WENT TO INDIAN SPRINGS WITH ME , WHOSE BROTHER FINISHED PRINCETON WITH MY WIFE .
In fact , MY WIFE saw ANOTHER GUY THAT WENT TO INDIAN SPRINGS WITH ME , WHOSE BROTHER FINISHED PRINCETON WITH MY WIFE THE FIRST TWO WEEKS when MY WIFE was up at PRINCETON for MY WIFE twenty-fifth reunion .
THE FIRST TWO WEEKS 's just really interesting how MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK do n't think about THE FIRST TWO WEEKS at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE , but that THE SCHOOLS YOU DECIDE TO GO TO are some of the most fundamental decisions that MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ever make in MY LIFE .
If MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had not gone to PRINCETON MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would n't have either of MY DAUGHTERS right now , because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA met both of MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA wives through PRINCETON .
It seems like THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION keep in touch A LOT .
Oh yeah , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA talk to PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to PRINCETON with ALMOST EVERY DAY .
Well , now particularly because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA friends who went to PRINCETON and MY WIFE has MY WIFE friends that went to PRINCETON .
MY DAUGHTER 'S GODMOTHER is A PRINCETON GRADUATE ; NO ! NO MAN was A PRINCETON GRADUATE .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA talk to A LOT OF PEOPLE that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to school with .
Are THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION going to be sending MY DAUGHTERS to PRINCETON ?
If MY DAUGHTERS 's where MY DAUGHTER 'S GODMOTHER wants to go .
If MY DAUGHTER 'S GODMOTHER is fortunate to get in , PRINCETON 's A LOT harder to get in HER NOW than when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went there and PRINCETON 's certainly more PRINCETON .
So , even if MY DAUGHTERS gave MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR SCHOLARSHIP , A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR SCHOLARSHIP would still be expensive .
Yeah , DYNAMITE HILL 've only been there once .
DYNAMITE HILL did n't apply there for college , A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR SCHOLARSHIP was A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR SCHOLARSHIP .
A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR SCHOLARSHIP 's beautiful , in THE MIDDLE OF A BLACK COMMUNITY .
DYNAMITE HILL did n't walk around enough .
There was a community of flags at the stoops .
Yeah , PRINCETON is PRINCETON .
THE ONLY ONE THAT IS OLDER may be THE ONLY ONE THAT IS OLDER .
THE ONLY ONE THAT IS OLDER was THE ONLY ONE THAT IS OLDER .
Yeah , DYNAMITE HILL did know THE ONLY ONE THAT IS OLDER , DYNAMITE HILL did n't know THE ONLY ONE THAT IS OLDER was THE ONLY ONE THAT IS OLDER .
Oh yeah , even if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK go in some of THE DORMS there now people used to have servants at PRINCETON .
SOME OF THE DORM ROOMS are set up for a student and SOME OF THE DORM ROOMS servant .
DYNAMITE HILL think DYNAMITE HILL could tell that when DYNAMITE HILL was staying there .
PAUL ROBESON is from PRINCETON and applied to PRINCETON and SOME OF THE DORM ROOMS would n't let PAUL ROBESON in .
Just because PAUL ROBESON was black ?
Yeah .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mean AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE was AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE , AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE was AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE , AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE was extraordinarily bright , AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE was AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE and AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE was from Princeton-his dad worked on 1968 WHEN THEY GOT THEIR FIRST CATHOLIC AND JEWISH STUDENTS , AND THEN IN 1969 THEY GOT THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS and SOME OF THE DORM ROOMS would n't let AN ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE in .
Yeah , DYNAMITE HILL 'm glad SEVERAL TIMES have changed .
Yeah , SOME OF THE DORM ROOMS have .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was actively involved in the anti-apartheid movement when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was at PRINCETON .
SOME OF THE DORM ROOMS had lots of money invested in South Africa .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA almost got expelled from school for protesting , we took over the administration building at THE SCHOOL MY SENIOR YEAR .
What year was that ?
THE FALL OF 1977 , THE FALL OF 1977 was THE FALL OF 1977 .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA graduated in JUNE OF 1978 , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA almost got put out of school .
Did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION talk THEM out of JUNE OF 1978 somehow or did THEM just change THEM minds ?
NO , THE SCHOOL just decided to put THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROUPED INTO THE HISPANIC CATEGORY DO N'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH on academic probation instead of expelling THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROUPED INTO THE HISPANIC CATEGORY DO N'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH .
NO could talk SOME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES while THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION were attending INDIAN SPRINGS , but DYNAMITE HILL have really wanted to ask THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION about THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION role on the alumni board at INDIAN SPRINGS .
Have THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION been involved in PLANNING REUNIONS ?
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 've been involved in PLANNING REUNIONS , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 've been involved in recruitment , SOME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES talk about curriculum , SOME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES do fundraising of course and for THE LAST YEAR MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have been MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
THE LAST YEAR 's difficult for a school that costs seventeen thousand dollars for day school , to recruit THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
THE BLACK STUDENTS WHO CAN AFFORD TO GO THERE can get in usually and are academically qualified to go there .
THE OTHER THING THAT WAS A STRONG FACTOR FOR ME GOING THERE 's THE OTHER THING THAT WAS A STRONG FACTOR FOR ME GOING THERE , not only do MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have to have the money to go there , but MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK got to be smart .
So if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK 're A BLACK KID WHO 'S SMART ENOUGH and BOTH MY PARENTS have enough money to send MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK there , then BOTH MY PARENTS can also send MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK to FINE ARTS , BOTH MY PARENTS can send MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK to ALTAMONT WHICH IS IN THE CITY , BOTH MY PARENTS can send MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK to the ALABAMA HIGH SCHOOL OF MATH and Science-which is free , BOTH MY PARENTS can send MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK to the honors program at JOHN CARROLL WHICH IS ABOUT HALF THAT PRICE .
Or MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have options to go out of state to school , so what has happened now is that in the 1960s and 1970s the white institutions were getting POOR BLACKS from inner cities to integrate POOR BLACKS schools , but now POOR BLACKS are getting BLACK KIDS THAT HAVE THE SAME EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND AS THE WHITE STUDENTS THAT GO THERE .
THE BLACK STUDENTS WHO CAN AFFORD TO GO THERE , usually went to private school all the way through elementary school .
THE BLACK STUDENTS WHO CAN AFFORD TO GO THERE were not like MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
THE BLACK STUDENTS WHO CAN AFFORD TO GO THERE 're much more like THE WHITE STUDENTS WHO GO TO INDIAN SPRINGS , the only difference is race .
THE BLACK STUDENTS WHO CAN AFFORD TO GO THERE background is very , very similar .
BOTH MY PARENTS have the same types of MY FIRST JOBS , BOTH MY PARENTS earn the same income strata and BOTH MY PARENTS live in THE SAME COMMUNITIES .
Typical black student at INDIAN SPRINGS now , BOTH MY PARENTS are BOTH MY PARENTS , BOTH MY PARENTS live in VESTAVIA or Mountain Brook ; INDIAN SPRINGS 's not like INDIAN SPRINGS was .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went there BOTH MY PARENTS were finding BLACK KIDS THAT HAVE THE SAME EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND AS THE WHITE STUDENTS THAT GO THERE from AN INNER CITY and bringing BOTH MY PARENTS there because-some of THEIR FIRST BLACK STUDENTS that came to INDIAN SPRINGS were part of the A Better Chance program .
Now BOTH MY PARENTS do have some OPRAH WINFREY scholars there now , which is a very , very good thing .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think BOTH MY PARENTS have ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS OPRAH WINFREY scholars who are at INDIAN SPRINGS .
OPRAH WINFREY has a scholarship program that sends INNER CITY KIDS to boarding schools , and three of the black students that are at INDIAN SPRINGS are OPRAH WINFREY scholars .
Are INNER CITY KIDS gifted STUDENTS THAT HAD GONE TO THESE MORE WELL KNOWN ?
Yeah , Yeah , INDIAN SPRINGS is REAL , REAL HIGH ACADEMICS .
INDIAN SPRINGS 's INDIAN SPRINGS and INDIAN SPRINGS 's even harder to stay .
When MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK look at REAL , REAL HIGH ACADEMICS graduates , BOTH GRADUATES OF PARKER HIGH SCHOOL , WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE BEST BLACK HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA typically have GRADUATING CLASSES WITH FORTY STUDENTS and ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS or FOUR OF US Ivy Leaguers and several people go on to the honors program at Vanderbilt , Emory , Swanee , WILLIAM and Mary-you know good Southern liberal arts SUBURBAN SCHOOLS .
BOTH GRADUATES OF PARKER HIGH SCHOOL , WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE BEST BLACK HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA have a very , very illustrious set of SUBURBAN SCHOOLS that the graduates of THAT SCHOOL , HER FATHER go to .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm proud to be a member of THE ALUMNI COUNCIL , because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA believe THIS to be true , that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm part of THE ALUMNI COUNCIL not just because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm black , but because THIS believe that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have something to contribute .
Nobody wants to be part of THE GROUP THAT HAD THE HIGHEST SCORES THEY PUT TOGETHER AN ENRICHMENT CLASS TO GO TO WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL , WHICH IS WHERE I WENT IN FIFTH GRADE just because of YOUR RACE .
Do THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION find that PLANNING REUNIONS are attended well ?
Yeah , WE had MY THIRTIETH REUNION IN 2004 .
One of my classmates is the publisher of THE BIRMINGHAM NEWS and THIRTIETH lives in like a three million dollar estate out in MOUNTAIN BROOK .
WE had THE LARGEST GRADUATING CLASS IN THE HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think WE had fifty four graduates , and WE had over FORTY people to come to MY THIRTIETH REUNION IN 2004 .
That is , everybody 's still left with a very positive impression ?
WE had a guy come here from FRANCE , who was living in FRANCE to come back for WE reunion .
Several people came from the west coast , a couple people from Massachusetts , Vermont and New England area .
WE had a classmate of mine that came back here from FRANCE .
Why was THE LARGEST GRADUATING CLASS IN THE HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL the largest graduating class ?
WE were the last class before THE SCHOOL was coeducational .
THE LAST YEAR left they admitted WHITE WOMEN .
A LOT OF PEOPLE did n't want to go there anymore .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA opposed coeducation at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE .
THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE ended up being better for the school in the long run , but in THE SHORT TERM THE SHORT TERM cut the enrollment .
Why did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION oppose THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE ?
Because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA thought that THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE would fundamentally change THE SCHOOL .
What would be the changes ?
Well , when MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have same sex education MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK do n't have a lot of the pressures that are negative in coeducation .
THE OTHER GUYS FROM YOUR SCHOOL are not competing for female attention .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 've read several studies that show that THE GIRLS tend to do better in technical fields in math and engineering .
Up until about the FIFTH grade level girls and boys achieve similarly in MATH AND SCIENCE , and then at that point which is right around puberty , FIFTH starts to change .
THESE GUYS become more aggressive , THESE GUYS speak out more in class and THE GIRLS become less inclined to be involved in the competitive fields , so THE GIRLS go into softer social sciences .
THESE GUYS 's why MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK hear SOME OF THE GOOFY COMMENTS like the ones that were made by the President of HARVARD , where SOME OF THE GOOFY COMMENTS was talking about THESE GUYS perhaps there was some genetic disparity between men and women that made men more suited towards engineering and technical related fields .
Which MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think is just stupid , HARVARD almost reminds MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA of RICHARD SHOCKLEY 'S opinions having to do with race .
HARVARD 's just sad , real , real sad .
HARVARD did change THE SCHOOL ; WE used to go to class in WE pajamas .
And when THE GIRLS came ?
Oh , NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . , NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . could n't do NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . .
THESE GUYS started dressing for THESE GUYS .
Even when it was all boys , there were THE GIRLS out there every weekend because all the girls used to come out there because the kids of the wealthiest families in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE went to school out there .
So , WE used to have dances .
WE had a sister school called BROOKHILL , WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHERE DEIDRE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL , DEIDRE NEWTON .
WE used to have A LOT OF COMBINED SOCIAL ACTIVITIES WITH THEM .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA liked A LOT OF COMBINED SOCIAL ACTIVITIES WITH THEM , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA liked living on campus .
BROOKHILL , WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHERE DEIDRE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL , DEIDRE NEWTON is no longer in existence , A LOT OF COMBINED SOCIAL ACTIVITIES WITH THEM merged with A SCHOOL CALLED BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY SCHOOL TO BECOME ALTAMONT .
Unless MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm mistaken DEIDRE NEWTON was DEIDRE NEWTON .
So DYNAMITE HILL guess THEY recruited DEIDRE NEWTON to desegregate THEY school ?
Well , again A SCHOOL CALLED BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY SCHOOL TO BECOME ALTAMONT was a natural extension from where THEY were .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think there was another white girl in THEY class at ELYTON VILLAGE that went to BROOKHILL , WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHERE DEIDRE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL , DEIDRE NEWTON .
Once THEY got put in the white enrichment , gifted class then THEY were exposed to EQUIVALENT OPPORTUNITIES that THE WHITE KIDS FROM THE PROJECTS had been exposed to all along .
It was n't so much that INDIAN SPRINGS did n't want THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS , THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS had the problem with A TRUST , but THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS did n't know any black students and did n't have any way of identifying THE STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL OR THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO GET THEM INTO BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
So THE FIRST was really THE FIRST , THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION were THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION .
Sure , sure .
So , after THE FIRST did A LOT more GIFTED BLACK STUDENTS start going to BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME ?
Well , GIFTED BLACK STUDENTS did .
THE OTHER THING THAT WAS A STRONG FACTOR FOR ME GOING THERE was that GIFTED BLACK STUDENTS started OTHER GIFTED PROGRAMS and then GIFTED BLACK STUDENTS eventually started magnet schools .
So , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK had THE SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS and RAMSEY was called an alternative school , but GIFTED BLACK STUDENTS had an admission exam .
So THE SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS was one way of letting the higher achieving ACADEMIC BLACK STUDENTS to get to go to a public school where ACADEMIC BLACK STUDENTS had programs that were specifically designed for ACADEMIC BLACK STUDENTS .
THE PROBLEM , and THE SAME REASON was THE SAME REASON that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got skipped , if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were A BLACK KID WHO 'S SMART ENOUGH ACADEMIC BLACK STUDENTS did n't have any programs for MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was in THE THIRD GRADE MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA made straight As and an F in conduct .
An F in conduct ?
Yeah because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was talking all the time , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was bored .
They did n't have any thing there to challenge MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA because A -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER had twenty seven other students to teach .
If MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have ONE or TWO gifted kids , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ca n't teach ONE OR TWO GIFTED KIDS and MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK really do n't need to teach ONE OR TWO GIFTED KIDS because ONE OR TWO GIFTED KIDS are going to get ONE on ONE OR TWO GIFTED KIDS own .
ONE OR TWO GIFTED KIDS could have almost put THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION in special education just because ONE OR TWO GIFTED KIDS did n't know what THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION needed , so ONE OR TWO GIFTED KIDS would think THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION were just troublesome .
Yeah .
DYNAMITE HILL wonder how many more gifted programs the board of education started .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA know there was one at Lincoln Elementary , because A FRIEND OF MINE was in AN ALL WHITE ENRICHMENT CLASS AT ELYTON SCHOOL and ONE OR TWO GIFTED KIDS were THE LAST YEAR .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA also knew THE WOMAN WHO TAUGHT THAT CLASS , BECAUSE SHE WAS IN MY SCHOOL , THE WOMAN WHO TAUGHT THAT CLASS , BECAUSE SHE WAS IN MY SCHOOL is dead now .
THE NAME OF DEIDRE NEWTON was Charlotte Haywood .
It seems like there were a handful more .
Do THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION think INDIAN SPRINGS was INDIAN SPRINGS that THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION went to out of all of them ?
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ca n't say that , because PRINCETON might be PRINCETON , if PRINCETON 's not PRINCETON is in the top THE FIVE or TEN .
It would be very , very difficult for MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to say that any school is better than PRINCETON , but from the standpoint of PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS in the south MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA absolutely believe that INDIAN SPRINGS was INDIAN SPRINGS at THE TIME , BEING SUPPORTIVE .
THE BEST HIGH SCHOOL FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF KID and may still be today .
But THE BEST HIGH SCHOOL FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF KID is THE BEST HIGH SCHOOL FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF KID , THE BEST HIGH SCHOOL FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF KID is not for all children .
If need A HIGHLY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT THEN INDIAN SPRINGS is not INDIAN SPRINGS .
A HIGHLY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT THEN sounds like A HIGHLY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT THEN was run sort of like A COLLEGE .
A HIGHLY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT THEN was , A HIGHLY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT THEN was based on the DYNAMITE HILL philosophy of learning .
So THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION had a lot of free range to come and go to GRADUATING CLASSES WITH FORTY STUDENTS ?
Absolutely WE did .
WE had humanities classes in THE NINTH GRADE .
Did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION have humanities classes before THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION went to INDIAN SPRINGS ?
NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did n't even know what humanities were .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA took LATIN IN THE NINTH GRADE , in the THE ELEVENTH grade , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA took French in THE NINTH and tenth and then Latin in THE ELEVENTH .
NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . had a Latin program for forty years , in fact MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA Latin teacher still teaches LATIN IN THE NINTH GRADE there now .
Again , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK did n't have other options .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK did n't have the JEFFERSON COUNTY INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE SCHOOL , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK did n't have The ALABAMA HIGH SCHOOL OF MATH and POLITICAL SCIENCE in Mobile , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK did n't have The Alabama High School of Fine Arts , RAMSEY was not JOHN CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL then .
JOHN CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL was n't even on THE BRUNO CAMPUS , NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . were still over here in Southside back in 1970 when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA started at INDIAN SPRINGS .
How did JOHN CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL feel to be that kind of trail blazer ?
It was a relief to have left ELYTON VILLAGE , because INDIAN SPRINGS was A WHOLE LOT more collegial type of an environment , THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROUPED INTO THE HISPANIC CATEGORY DO N'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH were A WHOLE LOT friendlier to ELYTON VILLAGE than THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROUPED INTO THE HISPANIC CATEGORY DO N'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH were at ELYTON VILLAGE .
At ELYTON VILLAGE , after THE FIRST YEAR or TWO , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA made FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE with THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL in TWENTY-FIVE , but MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA still did n't make FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE with THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was at INDIAN SPRINGS , everybody in THE SCHOOL was all together .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was also in MOUNTAIN BROOK COUNTRY CLUB and YOU STILL SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU MADE WHILE had ninety students in MOUNTAIN BROOK COUNTRY CLUB out of a school that had a population of two hundred .
The people in MOUNTAIN BROOK COUNTRY CLUB were very close because YOU STILL SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU MADE WHILE practiced five days a week .
So when THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION graduated there THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION automatically had a lot of FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE .
Oh sure .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK also traveled with FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE on tours , because YOU STILL SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU MADE WHILE did a fall and spring tour .
YOU STILL SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU MADE WHILE went to EUROPE together , YOU STILL SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU MADE WHILE went to NEW YORK and KANSAS CITY , and YOU STILL SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU MADE WHILE went all over A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR SCHOLARSHIP .
EUROPE was EUROPE and closely knit organization because YOU STILL SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU MADE WHILE spent so much time together .
Were YOU STILL SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU MADE WHILE living in COLLEGE HILLS , AS THAT NEIGHBORHOODS ' COMPLEXION CHANGED THEN THE SCHOOLS CHANGED TOO ?
NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . .
NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . .
NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . went to INDIAN SPRINGS with MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA , but ONE GUY FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD only stayed A YEAR .
MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND was MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND , MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND 's dead now .
THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL never even saw .
As A MATTER OF FACT , A MATTER OF FACT made A MATTER OF FACT very difficult for MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to date because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was at a predominantly white all boys ' boarding school , so MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did n't know any black girls .
So MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mother got MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA involved in SOME BLACK SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS so MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA could meet BLACK GIRLS MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA age .
Did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION end up dating some of SOME BLACK SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS ?
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did .
BLACK GIRLS like to ask about SO INTERRACIAL DATING , did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION see any going on at INDIAN SPRINGS ?
Oh hell no -LSB- Laughter -RSB- NO ! NO MAN , if BLACK GIRLS would have happened at INDIAN SPRINGS , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK would have gotten a beat down .
BLACK GIRLS would n't have -
Really ?
NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED .
Also , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK got to remember at the end of THE 1960 'S IT WOULD N'T HAVE BEEN SO MUCH THE WHITE FOLKS , but other black people would have ostracized MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK for dating outside YOUR RACE .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to PRINCETON PRINCETON was at the end of THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT , ACADEMIC BLACK STUDENTS were still wearing army fatigues and carrying Chairman Mao 's quotations around .
PRINCETON was very , very different .
We were at SORT OF THE TAIL END OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT because of the takeovers at Columbia and other schools like THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT , SO INTERRACIAL DATING was not acceptable .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK started to see SORT OF THE TAIL END OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT more MY SENIOR YEAR at PRINCETON and now SORT OF THE TAIL END OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT 's very common , not just at PRINCETON or INDIAN SPRINGS , but in BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS as well .
SORT OF THE TAIL END OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT did not go on , SORT OF THE TAIL END OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT just was n't accepted .
On EITHER SIDE ?
NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED .
If a black guy had gone out with A WHITE GIRL AND ANOTHER BLACK GIRL FOUND OUT ABOUT IT , A WHITE GIRL AND ANOTHER BLACK GIRL FOUND OUT ABOUT IT would have never dated MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK .
Did THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION have any sense that THE ADMINISTRATION AT either school was putting SOME KIND OF RACIAL -
None at all , WE were n't dating when WE were at ELYTON VILLAGE because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was only thirteen when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA got out of there , but at INDIAN SPRINGS there was no pressure from THE ADMINISTRATION AT there .
ELYTON VILLAGE was ELYTON VILLAGE , but it just was n't something that was socially acceptable .
Even on things besides dating like maybe befriending other white students ?
Oh sure , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went home to visit some of THE KIDS THAT WENT TO SCHOOL WITH ME .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE with FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE and still am to ALMOST EVERY DAY .
As to whether or not MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would have dated FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had one bad experience involving interracial dating in INDIAN SPRINGS .
WE had gone to MARTINSVILLE , Virginia to sing in a high school there , JEFFERSON COUNTY INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE SCHOOL was JEFFERSON COUNTY INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE SCHOOL .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA met SOME GIRLS there SOME GIRLS were in SOME GIRLS choir .
SOME GIRLS put WE up , when WE would travel to these different places the communities where WE would sing , either THE CHURCHES or PAST TWO ALL WHITE SCHOOLS would try and get BOTH MY PARENTS to house WE so that WE would n't have to get hotels .
WE stayed with A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL there in MARTINSVILLE , VIRGINIA and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA met a girl from that high school who was in SOME GIRLS choir who was white , and WE talked and stuff .
Then SOME GIRLS choir came down here the next year to sing in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE and WE hosted SOME GIRLS at INDIAN SPRINGS .
WE started talking , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA mean WE could n't really date because WE were living in different states .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA remember ONE OF THE GUYS in the choir telling MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA that-and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA had considered MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND to be MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND until this incident , MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND thought that it was a bad idea for MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA to be talking to A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was really , really surprised by ONE OF THE GUYS because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA thought MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND was cool and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did not expect MY MOTHER 'S BEST FRIEND to have that reaction .
Just because THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION talked to HER TOO often ?
Well , HER TOO saw MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA with A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL when they came to THE BRUNO CAMPUS .
A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL was A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL , and HER TOO remembered A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL .
So after that THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION did n't talk much with HER TOO anymore ?
NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . , sure did n't .
Have n't really spoken to HER TOO since NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . happened and NO , NO THAT WAS N'T ACCEPTED . 's been THIRTY FIVE YEARS ago now .
Yeah , some things do n't change .
The acceptability of ...
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'll give MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK an interesting statistic .
THE LAST STATISTIC THAT I SAW ON INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES IN THE UNITED STATES , NINETY PERCENT OF THEM THE MAN was black .
So when THE LAST STATISTIC THAT I SAW ON INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES IN THE UNITED STATES , NINETY PERCENT OF THEM THE MAN becomes really accepted , then THE LAST STATISTIC THAT I SAW ON INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES IN THE UNITED STATES , NINETY PERCENT OF THEM THE MAN will be relatively even .
THE LAST STATISTIC THAT I SAW ON INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES IN THE UNITED STATES , NINETY PERCENT OF THEM THE MAN wo n't be BLACK MEN DATING WHITE WOMEN , THE LAST STATISTIC THAT I SAW ON INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES IN THE UNITED STATES , NINETY PERCENT OF THEM THE MAN 'll be black people dating THE WAY PEOPLE and marrying THE WAY PEOPLE .
THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION know , BLACK MEN DATING WHITE WOMEN 're not there yet .
BLACK MEN DATING WHITE WOMEN 're not there yet .
There are certain cities in THE UNITED STATES , NINETY PERCENT OF THEM THE MAN that are more favorable for interracial relationships and people know that and BLACK MEN DATING WHITE WOMEN move there .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have a couple of FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE , FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE moved to Seattle from TEXAS because FRIENDS THAT ARE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE are more accepted there .
DENVER is DENVER , so a lot of PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA that date or married interracially move there for THE SAME REASON .
THE THING ABOUT INTERRACIAL DATING is that when MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have YOUR KIDS , YOUR KIDS really catch THE THING ABOUT INTERRACIAL DATING .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have A REAL GOOD FRIEND here in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE .
A REAL GOOD FRIEND caught hell growing up , because A REAL GOOD FRIEND grew up in South Central Los Angeles and A REAL GOOD FRIEND mother was the only white person that A REAL GOOD FRIEND said lived in Compton .
A REAL GOOD FRIEND went to ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS or FOUR OF US high schools because of the problems that A REAL GOOD FRIEND had being accepted .
A REAL GOOD FRIEND was neither white nor black , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA can imagine what ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS must have been like growing up in SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES IN THE LATE 1960 'S AND EARLY 1970 'S , with DADDY and BLUE EYES .
Yeah , could be kind of tough growing up in SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES IN THE LATE 1960 'S AND EARLY 1970 'S any way .
Did anybody do THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER that surprised THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION favorably ? Like A REAL GOOD FRIEND ?
Not really at INDIAN SPRINGS .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA talked to MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK about THE EXPERIENCE AT ELYTON with MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA teacher , but MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did n't even find THE EXPERIENCE AT ELYTON out until THIRTY FIVE YEARS later .
INDIAN SPRINGS was INDIAN SPRINGS .
There were eighty students that lived on campus , WE lived in THE DORMS , and WE had BOTH MY PARENTS .
WE used to go over to there A VERY , VERY UNREALISTIC ENVIRONMENT .
Like MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA said , WE wore OUR PAJAMAS to class , so A VERY , VERY UNREALISTIC ENVIRONMENT was A VERY , VERY UNREALISTIC ENVIRONMENT .
How much connection and relationship do THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION think A VERY , VERY UNREALISTIC ENVIRONMENT takes for PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA to not have to worry about prejudice ?
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think A VERY , VERY UNREALISTIC ENVIRONMENT needs to be more than just school .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think A VERY , VERY UNREALISTIC ENVIRONMENT needs to be through religious institutions and through other social related organizations , because socially to a much greater degree than WE are in SUBURBAN SCHOOLS ... because SUBURBAN SCHOOLS can be controlled ; MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK can pass a law that says that SUBURBAN SCHOOLS have to be integrated .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ca n't pass a law that says A CHURCH has to be integrated .
The saying is that MORNING is Sunday MORNING .
So , THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CHURCHES IN THIS STATE are still all white and all black .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK go to some mixed race churches where THE STATE , THAT WAS N'T HERE will be predominantly white with a few blacks and ASIANS OR HISPANICS , or predominantly black with a few whites or ASIANS OR HISPANICS .
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CHURCHES IN THIS STATE are all white or all black .
MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ca n't enforce that , there is no way MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK can pass a law that says A CHURCH has to have THE MEMBERS or has to have black members .
Other social organizations ; country CLUBS-SHOAL CREEK is A PERFECT EXAMPLE .
When THE PGA TOUR was playing here , PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA protested THE PGA TOUR because CLUBS-SHOAL CREEK was CLUBS-SHOAL CREEK .
So PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA went out and made THE ONLY BLACK LAWYER LICENSED IN THE STATE an honorary member so PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA could keep the tournament .
One of my clients now is THE FIRST BLACK PAYING MEMBER OF SHOAL CREEK .
THE FIRST BLACK PAYING MEMBER OF SHOAL CREEK 's forty seven years old .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA bet still PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA do n't even have TEN black members .
When MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK start talking about having access to people in BUSINESS AND STUFF like that MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK need to be able to belong to the MOUNTAIN BROOK COUNTRY CLUB and Kiwanis and country clubs and SOME INTERESTING STUFF .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA would dare say there are ALMOST NO BLACK MEMBERS AT MOUNTAIN BROOK COUNTRY CLUB .
ALMOST NO BLACK MEMBERS AT MOUNTAIN BROOK COUNTRY CLUB 's where MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK get THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA to develop THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEN TRANSLATE INTO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES , and MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK can never penetrate that if the only interaction MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have with PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA is strictly business .
So in THE SUPREME COURT CASE THAT DEALT WITH LOITERING , schooling helped THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION to achieve THE SUPREME COURT CASE THAT DEALT WITH LOITERING .
Sure because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA know MUCH THE WHITE FOLKS , because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to school with ALMOST NO BLACK MEMBERS AT MOUNTAIN BROOK COUNTRY CLUB .
What do THE FIRST ONES TO GET EXPOSED TO THAT WHOLE AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 'S EDUCATION think could have been done differently to help PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA ?
Interracial athletics .
Up until 1969 MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA think 1969 was against the law for BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS to participate in interscholastic high school athletics in THE STATE , THAT WAS N'T HERE .
BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS had A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP , BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS had black high school championship and BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS had a white high school football championship and a white high school basketball championship .
A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP was just in either 1968 or 1969 that there was ever a game between TWO of these segregated schools .
A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP was when Banks High School played PARKER , BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS beat BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS like fifty five to ONLY THREE OF US THAT WERE IN THAT CLASS , down at LEGION FIELD .
Beat the tar out of BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS .
BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS had better coaches , better facilities and better equipment .
BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME got used books , BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS got the football helmets THE WHITES had used already , BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS got the uniforms , unless MY PARENT 'S association or booster club raised LESS MONEY , BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS got THE STUFF THAT WAS HAPPENING HERE PEOPLE that THE WHITE SCHOOLS , WHICH WERE INTEGRATED TO SOME DEGREE BUT NOT REALLY INTEGRATED did n't want .
-LSB- PHONE RINGS . -RSB-
With MY TWENTY YEAR OLD , as MY PARENT 'S grew older MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA let MY PARENT 'S watch `` Roots . ''
What MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA did n't want to do is to convey bitterness because MY TWENTY YEAR OLD 's difficult to talk about THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU WITHOUT SOUNDING BITTER .
In an hour and a half interview MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK can get a better sense of MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA as a person because of all of the things we have talked about , the good and the bad .
When YOUR CHILD sees something on TELEVISION ABOUT THE 1960S or THEY see the images of THE POLICE DOGS and SOME INTERESTING STUFF and YOUR CHILD says , `` DADDY did n't MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK grow up in BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE , did anything like THE 1960S ever happen to MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK ? '' TELEVISION ABOUT THE 1960S 's very difficult to talk to THEY about that in a balanced manner .
TELEVISION ABOUT THE 1960S 's difficult for A CHILD THAT GREW UP IN WASHINGTON D.C.-BECAUSE MY OLDER DAUGHTER GREW UP IN WASHINGTON D.C. , TELEVISION ABOUT THE 1960S 's difficult for A CHILD THAT GREW UP IN WASHINGTON D.C.-BECAUSE MY OLDER DAUGHTER GREW UP IN WASHINGTON D.C. to come here and see the lack of opportunity and the obvious racism and class related segregation that occurs here .
DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER went to FLORIDA A&M , and when DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER got down there-Tallahassee is still very segregated ; FLORIDA A&M 's like BIRMINGHAM , WHO IS A WOMAN WHO IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE , but FLORIDA A&M 's FLORIDA A&M .
DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER 's TWENTY now and DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER 's a graduate of college and DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER understands the balance and DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER 's gone to school there and gone to WHITE PRIVATE SCHOOLS and BETTER BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS in DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER educational history .
So DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER has A BALANCED UNDERSTANDING OF IT and A BALANCED UNDERSTANDING OF IT 's A LOT easier to talk to HER NOW .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA THE FIVE and a half year old is tough sometimes .
DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER 's in a summer camp now where DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER is DEIDRE NEWTON .
LAST WEEK , DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER was in another summer camp where there were TWO blacks there and one of the white girls there would n't let DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER play a little game TWO BLACKS were playing .
TWO BLACKS said , `` We do n't want to play with MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK because MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK 're brown . ''
TWO BLACKS 's difficult to explain to DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER , and MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have to SOME KIND OF RACIAL do SOME KIND OF RACIAL because DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER mother is West Indian .
DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER did n't encounter THOSE THINGS GROWING UP .
DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER grew up in GUYANA and then DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER moved to WASHINGTON D.C. WHICH HAD THE LARGEST BLACK MIDDLE CLASS AND THE MOST PROMINENT BLACK MIDDLE CLASS OF ANY CITY IN THE UNITED STATES .
GUYANA was where DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER grew up , so DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER had a completely unrealistic view of HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST GRADE BLACK PEOPLE WHO DID N'T HAVE WEALTH OR EDUCATION interact with whites in THE UNITED STATES , NINETY PERCENT OF THEM THE MAN by moving to DC .
DEMETRIUS NEWTON 'S DAUGHTER comes from A WELL-TO-DO FAMILY IN GUYANA , and GUYANA half the people there are EAST INDIAN or Portuguese , so A WELL-TO-DO FAMILY IN GUYANA , AND GUYANA do n't discriminate against THE BLACKS THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE TO SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES .
A WELL-TO-DO FAMILY IN GUYANA , AND GUYANA have other people to discriminate against .
For MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA younger daughter who has always gone to WHITE PRIVATE SCHOOLS , GUYANA 's just very , very difficult to explain to MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER WHO HAS ALWAYS GONE TO PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS why YOUR KIDS do n't like MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER WHO HAS ALWAYS GONE TO PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS .
Does MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER WHO HAS ALWAYS GONE TO PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS have any sense of racial prejudice at all ?
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA do n't know that MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER WHO HAS ALWAYS GONE TO PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS sees GUYANA as race , MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER WHO HAS ALWAYS GONE TO PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS associates GUYANA with color .
WE have PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY that A LOOK are EAST INDIAN and WE have PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA than MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA am , particularly on A WELL-TO-DO FAMILY IN GUYANA mother 's side .
So , when A CHILD says `` MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK 're brown , '' A CHILD does n't think of THAT AS ETHNICITY , A CHILD thinks of THAT AS ETHNICITY because of THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA do n't know if MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 'm being clear about THAT AS ETHNICITY , but there is a difference .
If AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH A LIGHT COMPLEXION was there with AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH A LIGHT COMPLEXION AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH A LIGHT COMPLEXION would n't expect PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY to be treated the way AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH A LIGHT COMPLEXION was treated .
THE THING THAT WAS ODD ABOUT THE SOUTH was that if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have one drop of black blood MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK 're black .
PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA are black , like in NEW ORLEANS .
In NEW ORLEANS PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA had quadroons and octoroons .
When MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA talked to MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA twenty year old about that she said , `` PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA have what ? '' Yeah , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were quadroon which was one black relative , one white relative of MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK grandparents , MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK were octoroon-it 's just weird THOSE THINGS GROWING UP we came up with to deal with SOME INTERESTING STUFF .
One black grandparent is quadroon -
Is that quadroon ? Because MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have FOUR OF US grandparents .
If DYNAMITE HILL have ONE GREAT GRANDPARENT WHO 'S BLACK -
Okay , then MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK are octoroon .
ONE GREAT GRANDPARENT WHO 'S BLACK - 's weird that we came up with BOTH ALL BLACK SCHOOLS AT THE TIME .
In BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA , if MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK have one drop of black blood MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK are black .
Still ?
Still .
Up until THE LAST CENSUS PEOPLE THAT OWNED LAND AND BUSINESSES HERE-IF YOU EVER WANT TO READ SOME INTERESTING STUFF ABOUT ALABAMA did n't have the opportunity to put EVEN THE RESPONDENTS OF THE CENSUS , EVEN THE RESPONDENTS OF THE CENSUS , even on EVEN THE RESPONDENTS OF THE CENSUS tax returns .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA 've had PEOPLE COME IN AND TALK TO ME COMPLAINING THAT THEIR KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL and PEOPLE COME IN AND TALK TO ME COMPLAINING THAT THEIR KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL had to be either white or black .
BIRACIAL , EVEN THE RESPONDENTS OF THE CENSUS 's like , MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA child has ONE white parent and ONE HISPANIC parent or one black parent and one Hispanic parent , why do ONE WHITE PARENT AND ONE HISPANIC PARENT have to put down BLACK ? ONE WHITE PARENT 's like saying ONE WHITE PARENT AND ONE HISPANIC PARENT do n't have a white parent .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA never thought of ONE as a big deal because to MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA everybody here that was n't white was black , because we did n't have any Asians or HISPANICS when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was growing up .
THE FIRST ASIAN was when MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA was MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA , it was a Korean kid who came here and went to INDIAN SPRINGS .
THE FIRST ASIAN name was Jun Kim , and THE FIRST ASIAN was THE FIRST ASIAN that MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA ever knew personally .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA never knew a ONE HISPANIC person until MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA went to PRINCETON .
It was odd to MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA because THE FIRST HISPANIC I MET was Puerto Rican , and THE FIRST HISPANIC I MET was as dark as MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA am with nappy hair .
THE FIRST HISPANIC I MET considered THE FIRST HISPANIC I MET to be Hispanic , THE FIRST HISPANIC I MET name was Sergio Sotamundo , and THE FIRST HISPANIC I MET looked just like MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA !
Yes , THE LAST CENSUS is still trying to figure out how to make that cultural distinction and also make a race distinction .
ONE HISPANIC is not AN ETHNICITY , all it means is that MULATTO WHICH IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK come from a country that speaks Spanish .
AN ETHNICITY has a cultural -
AN ETHNICITY 's like calling MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA English , because we speak English here , AN ETHNICITY does n't make any sense .
PUERTO RICAN , SO I ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU CALL PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM GUATEMALA , OTHER THAN `` GUATEMALAN here is PUERTO RICAN , SO I ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU CALL PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM GUATEMALA , OTHER THAN `` GUATEMALAN and PUERTO RICAN , SO I ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU CALL PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM GUATEMALA , OTHER THAN `` GUATEMALAN 's PUERTO RICAN , SO I ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU CALL PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM GUATEMALA , OTHER THAN `` GUATEMALAN . ''
It seems to MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA that a Guatemalan does n't have anything more in COMMON WITH A PERSON FROM MADRID than MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA do with a white person from Fairfield .
COMMON WITH A PERSON FROM MADRID just does n't make any sense .
Why are PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM GUATEMALA , OTHER THAN `` GUATEMALAN grouped together ? Guatemalans and Hondurans tend to be mestizo , PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM GUATEMALA , OTHER THAN `` GUATEMALAN 're more Mayan than PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM GUATEMALA , OTHER THAN `` GUATEMALAN are related to white folks from MADRID .
MANY OF THEM do n't even speak Spanish ! THE OTHER THING THAT WAS A STRONG FACTOR FOR ME GOING THERE 's THE OTHER THING THAT WAS A STRONG FACTOR FOR ME GOING THERE , a lot of THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROUPED INTO THE HISPANIC CATEGORY DO N'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH .
MANY OF THEM have nothing in COMMON WITH A PERSON FROM MADRID .
MANY OF THEM do n't have anything in common ! MANY OF THEM speak Indian dialects , or Mexicali is one for instance .
MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA run into that all the time in court because MR. GLENNON THREATT IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA have a lot of CLIENTS now CLIENTS are not English speaking .
SOME OF THEM are Spanish speaking and some of SOME OF THEM are not , but SOME OF THEM are called ONE HISPANIC even if SOME OF THEM do n't speak Spanish .
