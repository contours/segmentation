MY ANCESTORS ON THE BAXLEY SIDE were probably the FIRST , if not MY ANCESTORS ON THE BAXLEY SIDE were among the FIRST , white European people in THAT AREA .
In THE FACT , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was born in the 1700s .
MY ANCESTORS ON THE BAXLEY SIDE came here -- fathers fought in the Civil War for THE SOUTH .

THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think ONE OF THEM got some job later working in the salt works in Pensacola and that somehow exempted SOME OF THEM from having to be in the Army .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think ONE OF THEM was classified as necessary labor , but THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS were soldiers during almost the whole war .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA roots are all in THE SOUTH , mostly in ALABAMA '' -- HE , and mostly in the little corner of ALABAMA '' -- HE where THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was born .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was educated in THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF DOTHAN and went to the University of Alabama to BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND LAW SCHOOL .

THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA finished Dothan High School in ' 58 .
What else do YOU need ?
Then how did YOU decide to run for ATTORNEY GENERAL ?
Well , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA suppose , for THE YEARS decided THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA wanted to give A TRY to POLITICS because of MY FEELINGS ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS .
At FIRST when THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was following the news , THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT and things of that nature , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was still in high school in ninth or tenth grade .
Even earlier than THE EARLIEST , THE EARLIEST THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA remember as A REAL SMALL CHILD , A REAL SMALL CHILD , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA wondered about the treatment of BLACK PEOPLE that YOUR FAMILY would teach THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA to respect and love , playmates , ladies that worked in OUR house and kept THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA brother .
ONE OF THEIR SONS THAT WAS OLDER THAT KEPT US AFTER SCHOOL was out so that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA mother could work , after OUR started school .
ONE OF THEIR SONS THAT WAS OLDER THAT KEPT US AFTER SCHOOL did n't take a rocket scientist to see that THESE PEOPLE were treated differently if THESE PEOPLE skin color happened to be black .
It was not what YOU were taught in church .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA would ask MY PARENTS at A VERY YOUNG AGE and never get very satisfactory answers , in fact , not satisfactory at all .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA never got answers that made any sense whatsoever .
MY PARENTS were MY PARENTS .
MY PARENTS said , `` YOU 've got to treat everybody decently , but YOU just ca n't do certain things .
It 'll ruin YOU . ''
For instance , certain things like letting BLACK PEOPLE ride in THE FRONT OF THE CAR .
BLACK PEOPLE had to ride in the back even though there was a vacant seat in THE FRONT OF THE CAR .
STUPID THINGS .
At SOME POINT THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA thought THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA wanted to leave , but then at SOME TIME IN COLLEGE THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA decided if YOU wanted to stay and change that THE WAY TO DO IT was in POLITICS .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA felt like by A PRETTY HIGH JOB IN JOURNALISM THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA perhaps had a knack for POLITICS so POLITICS 's how THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA decided THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'd go into POLITICS .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA always liked THE EXCITEMENT OF IT anyway .
Early on THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA wanted to be a baseball player , but THE EXCITEMENT OF IT became pretty obvious at an early age THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA did n't have any talent .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA finished BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND LAW SCHOOL , clerked for a year at the state supreme court .
It was AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE .
AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE was AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE to MONTGOMERY march .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA watched a lot of THE FAMOUS ARGUMENTS in FRONT OF JUDGE FRANK JOHNSON .
MY ROOMMATE , who 'd been one of my classmates in BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND LAW SCHOOL , was clerking with JUDGE FRANK JOHNSON so MY ROOMMATE got THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA in for every big argument on every case in FRONT OF JUDGE FRANK JOHNSON .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA watched them all .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA went off for a little while in service , basic training , and then came back to DOTHAN and went in with a law firm .
AN OPENING came up for DISTRICT ATTORNEY , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA decided to go for AN OPENING , and became DISTRICT ATTORNEY at A VERY YOUNG AGE , twenty-four or FIVE .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think had somewhat of a knack for being A COURTROOM LAWYER .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA prepared THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA cases well and got something of a reputation , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA suppose , for being an aggressive advocate .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA decided in 1970 to run for ATTORNEY GENERAL and ran against an incumbent .
Nobody much gave THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA A CHANCE .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had a lot of good help and put together a campaign that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm still very proud of and unseated BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
Then THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT I FELT LIKE I COULD FOR CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE TREATED A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION AND ADVANCING WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE LEGITIMATE GOALS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA thought , `` If YOU do n't do something now YOU might not ever have A CHANCE again . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA started being pretty active in THAT AREA , did a lot of STUPID THINGS .
THE FIRST ONE was open THE BOMBING INVESTIGATION because THE FIRST ONE , had really affected THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA by making THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA want to stay in ALABAMA '' -- HE .
THE FIRST ONE sickened THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA , the climate that had allowed these kind of atrocities to happen , that being the worst of many atrocities .
At AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE WE opened that THE BOMBING CASE though , WE did n't do WE publicly .
WE did n't want anybody to know about AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE .
It was not something YOU want to publicize , where YOU 're coming from in AN INVESTIGATION .
YOU do n't want publicity .
It was several years before the word got out , not from WE , that WE were looking into that crime , trying to solve THE BOMBING CASE .
The things that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA did in CIVIL RIGHTS early on CIVIL RIGHTS got publicity were n't related to AN INVESTIGATION because it was many years before CIVIL RIGHTS became public .
Do YOU want THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA to keep going about CIVIL RIGHTS , or do YOU want to stick to THE BOMBING INVESTIGATION ?
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON 'd like to hear about BOTH .
Let BOTH do some of the other cases that YOU worked on FIRST , and then we 'll do THAT BOMBING RIGHT NEAR HER .
Well , at the time THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA came in , there were A LOT OF CASES pending about the way VARIOUS PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN THE SOUTH were trying to , in essence , hold back the tide .
VARIOUS PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN THE SOUTH were filing all these crazy suits to block JURY SERVICE , VOTING PARTICIPATION , THINGS OF THAT NATURE FOR BLACK PEOPLE .
CIVIL RIGHTS acts had passed A FEW YEARS before , but AN ONGOING BATTLE was still AN ONGOING BATTLE in some parts of THE STATE and in a lot of parts of THE SOUTH .
At AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA came in ALABAMA '' -- HE was a party in SEVERAL CASES WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO EITHER DELAY OR STOP SOME ASPECT OF EQUAL RIGHTS , PRIMARILY JURY SERVICE , VOTING PARTICIPATION , THINGS OF THAT NATURE FOR BLACK PEOPLE .
VOTING PROBABLY NUMBER ONE .
The states , SURE MISSISSIPPI , GEORGIA , maybe THE SOUTH , maybe Louisiana , several of the deep South states -- can YOU turn VOTING PROBABLY NUMBER ONE . off JUST A MINUTE ?
Okay , go ahead .
Okay .
SEVERAL OF THE SOUTHERN STATES , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA wo n't try to -- THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA do remember for SURE MISSISSIPPI was one .
As THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA recall there were FOUR .
FOUR could have been FIVE , but ALABAMA '' -- HE was one of them , and SEVERAL OF THE SOUTHERN STATES had filed these suits that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA do n't think made any sense , logic , or anything else .
As THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA recall CALIFORNIA and maybe MASSACHUSETTS tried to force busing with some convoluted theory that if YOU made SEVERAL OF THE SOUTHERN STATES have busing in THE NORTH that THE NORTH would make THESE PEOPLE quit trying to integrate THE SOUTH .
CALIFORNIA did n't make any sense to THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA failed to see how taking positions like THAT IN THE NORTH would help THAT IN THE NORTH defend THOSE THINGS in THE SOUTH .
Before THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA even went into OFFICE , AFTER I 'D BEEN ELECTED BUT BEFORE I WENT INTO OFFICE , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said WE were going to get out of THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS MY FIRST DAY .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll never forget .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was in MEREDIAN , Mississippi .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had gone to visit SOME FRIENDS in BUTLER , ALABAMA '' -- HE , and WE had gone over to MEREDIAN to eat lunch because A -RRB- MEREDIAN had better restaurants than SOME FRIENDS did in BUTLER , and b -RRB- Meredian , THE MAIN REASON was THE MAIN REASON , at THAT TIME WAS `` WET , '' and Choctaw County , Alabama was `` dry , '' so WE went over to MEREDIAN .
The lunch drug on into LATE THAT AFTERNOON .
WE had A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER .
A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER came down to join WE and mentioned that the Attorney General from SURE MISSISSIPPI , A. F. Simmer , Al Simmer , Judge Simmer , was in town making a speech .
A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER said , `` WE ought to get A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER to come by and meet YOU . ''
A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER went and fetched A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER , and A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER came by .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA only drank beer , but THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'd had seven , eight , TEN OF THEM by A PRETTY HIGH JOB IN JOURNALISM .
A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER was A GREAT GUY , WONDERFUL , WONDERFUL , OUTGOING , DECENT , FUN FELLOW .
A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER said A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER was looking forward to THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA going to SEVERAL CASES WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO EITHER DELAY OR STOP SOME ASPECT OF EQUAL RIGHTS , PRIMARILY , that A GREAT GUY , WONDERFUL , WONDERFUL , OUTGOING , DECENT , FUN FELLOW all had a good time going to THE HEARINGS , THE CASES THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm talking about in CALIFORNIA , MASSACHUSETTS , or wherever A GREAT GUY , WONDERFUL , WONDERFUL , OUTGOING , DECENT , FUN FELLOW had A GREAT GUY , WONDERFUL , WONDERFUL , OUTGOING , DECENT , FUN FELLOW .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm not going to be going .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm going to get US out of there MY FIRST DAY THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm in office . ''
A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER said , `` Oh , do n't do US .
Do n't do US . ''
A FRIEND THAT WAS A REPORTER FOR THE MEREDIAN STAR NEWSPAPER said , `` YOU do n't have to say anything at THE HEARINGS , THE CASES , just go .
US 've hired a firm to do US arguing for US . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` US would be another reason for THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA to get out .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm not going to be a cheerleader .
If THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm going to go court THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm going to be THE ONE DOING THE ARGUMENTS . ''
Anyway , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA told HIM THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was going to get out , and HIM tried to talk THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA out of THE ONE DOING THE ARGUMENTS .
A couple of A FEW YEARS -- THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was single .
HIM had a young assistant that was A BEAUTIFUL GIRL , A BEAUTIFUL GIRL .
SHE AND I dated for A LITTLE WHILE .
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL came over A CHARMING FELLOW to an Alabama/Old Miss game , to INJURED BIRMINGHAM .
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL told THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA later that A CHARMING FELLOW called A BEAUTIFUL GIRL in and said , `` YOU know Vee , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA know that young man that 's Attorney General of ALABAMA '' -- HE 'd found out that SHE AND I had had some dates and A BEAUTIFUL GIRL 'd been over A CHARMING FELLOW .
A CHARMING FELLOW said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA know A CHARMING FELLOW 's probably A CHARMING FELLOW .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm sure A CHARMING FELLOW 's A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH .
A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH 's all right .
A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH 's well and good for YOU to have fun with A CHARMING FELLOW , but now if YOU start thinking about getting serious YOU need to realize that that young man 's a dangerous radical . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA always got A KICK out of A KICK .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was very fond of A CHARMING FELLOW .
Anyway , getting back to SOME POINT , shortly after THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was in OFFICE , AFTER I 'D BEEN ELECTED BUT BEFORE I WENT INTO OFFICE , maybe just a few days , THE HEAD OF OUR CIVIL DIVISION WHO AT THE TIME was A COURTROOM LAWYER by the name of GORDON MADISON .
Everybody called A COURTROOM LAWYER Mad or Maddy .
A COURTROOM LAWYER was an older man about MY DAD 'S age or maybe even older .
A COURTROOM LAWYER 'd been with THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S OFFICE many years , and at one AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE had served in the state senate from Tuscaloosa .
A COURTROOM LAWYER was widely recognized when THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA came in as the best , most able lawyer in BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA office -- career lawyer .
Later the people THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA brought in were also very , very able , but of THE ONES DOING IT EVEN THOUGH THE ONES NOW , IT HURTS THEIR FEELINGS TO BE CRITICIZED A COURTROOM LAWYER was by far , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think , the most able .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA got a list of all the cases that were pending in ALABAMA '' -- HE , obstructionist type cases on these voting rights matters and OTHERS .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA wanted A COURTROOM LAWYER to go down and dismiss OTHERS all .
Most of OTHERS , if not all of them , in FRONT OF JUDGE FRANK JOHNSON .
One day shortly after THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was in office GORDON MADISON went down and dismissed on THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA orders all of the cases that THE STATE had brought trying to obstruct enforcement of EQUAL RIGHTS .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think WE might have also dismissed some defenses or things in CASES WHERE WE WERE DEFENDANTS .
LATE THAT AFTERNOON DEFENDANTS said that GORDON MADISON needed to see THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was really busy .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA thought , `` Uh-oh , what does GORDON MADISON want ? '' DEFENDANTS said , `` GORDON MADISON says GORDON MADISON 's got to talk to YOU . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was A LITTLE BIT afraid that GORDON MADISON may come in and say GORDON MADISON was so upset with THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA doing that that GORDON MADISON was going to quit or some thing like that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA did n't know how GORDON MADISON felt .
Like THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA say , GORDON MADISON was MY DAD 'S age , but GORDON MADISON was well thought of .
MY DAD 'S thought a lot of MY DAD 'S and was very fond of MY DAD 'S .
MY DAD 'S was , incidentally , a direct descendant of James Madison , President Madison .
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` Well , all right .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll see MY DAD 'S . ''
So MY DAD 'S came in and sat down and said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA hate to take up YOU time , but THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA just want to tell YOU something . ''
MY DAD 'S said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA want to thank YOU for giving THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT I FELT LIKE I COULD FOR CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE TREATED A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION AND ADVANCING WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE LEGITIMATE GOALS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG , LONG TIME is THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG , LONG TIME since THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 've worked for THE STATE that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA held THE HEAD OF OUR CIVIL DIVISION WHO AT THE TIME up high after THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA left the courthouse . ''
THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG , LONG TIME really affected THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG , LONG TIME still does when THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think about a distinguished gentleman like Gordon Madison coming in and saying THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG , LONG TIME .
THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG , LONG TIME made THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA know that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was n't going to be fighting a lonely battle .
There were going to be a lot of THESE PEOPLE .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA do n't mean to give the impression -- let THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA correct this early on -- even in college or now that all THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA thought about was CIVIL RIGHTS .
GOSH , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA did OTHER CASES , too , OTHER CASES did n't have anything to do with CIVIL RIGHTS , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA like to think did THESE PEOPLE well , and enjoyed life .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA do n't want THESE PEOPLE to think that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was obsessed with THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT I FELT LIKE I COULD FOR CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE TREATED A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION AND ADVANCING WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE LEGITIMATE GOALS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
But , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA reckon THE NEXT THING I STARTED OUT TRYING TO BREAK THE COLOR LINE , SO TO SPEAK , AND HIRE SOME BLACK ASSISTANT ATTORNEYS GENERAL .
THE NEXT THING I STARTED OUT TRYING TO BREAK THE COLOR LINE , SO TO SPEAK , AND HIRE SOME BLACK ASSISTANT ATTORNEYS GENERAL took a little while to find THE FIRST ONE , and THE NEXT THING I STARTED OUT TRYING TO BREAK THE COLOR LINE , SO TO SPEAK , AND HIRE SOME BLACK ASSISTANT ATTORNEYS GENERAL was MYRON THOMPSON .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA found MYRON THOMPSON through the help of THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA father who was friends with MYRON THOMPSON grandfather , A GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF JOHN HENRY GLANTON WHOSE SON FOR YEARS WAS ON THE DOTHAN CITY COUNCIL , A GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF JOHN HENRY GLANTON WHOSE SON FOR YEARS WAS ON THE DOTHAN CITY COUNCIL .
Of course back at THAT TIME WAS `` WET MYRON THOMPSON was n't on THE DOTHAN CITY COUNCIL .
By AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA hired MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
None of THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS worked up there for THE STATE .
When WE hired MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 'd finished way up at the top of MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS class at Yale Law School .
MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS turned down jobs in New York and elsewhere paying MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS substantially more than what WE could pay MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS to come back to Alabama which was , of course , MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS home .
MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS mom and MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS step father were in TUSKEGEE and MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS grandparents in DOTHAN .
MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS was a terrific lawyer , brilliant guy , and did a great job for THE STATE .
MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 's now MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 's been on THE BENCH .
CARTER appointed CARTER .
After several years with THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA CARTER left and went back to DOTHAN and had a very successful law practice there before CARTER was appointed to THE BENCH .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA got THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS or FOUR hate letters about FOUR , and FOUR was all .
THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS was THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS .
WE set out to try to bring others .
WE did n't want just tokenism .
Shortly behind MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE brought in WE brought in DAN THOMPSON WHO 'D FINISHED AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL , then later THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think became general council for Potomac Bell or maybe AT&T or something .
DAN THOMPSON WHO 'D FINISHED AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL moved back .
SOME OF HIS PEOPLE were from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think SOME OF HIS PEOPLE preferred the East so SOME OF HIS PEOPLE moved back , but SOME OF HIS PEOPLE was a great addition also .
Soon Charlie Price came in .
CHARLIE 'S grew up A LOT rougher than MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS or DAN THOMPSON WHO 'D FINISHED AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL .
CHARLIE 'S grew up A LOT poorer , very different from MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS and DAN THOMPSON WHO 'D FINISHED AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL whose THEIR FAMILIES had advantages .
For instance , DAN 'S FATHER was DAN 'S FATHER .
DAN 'S FATHER was , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA believe , head of the VA Hospital in TUSKEGEE , and MYRON THOMPSON I THINK THE ONLY BLACKS THAT WORKED FOR THE STATE WERE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS family was educated .
CHARLIE 'S family were working , but CHARLIE 'S worked CHARLIE 'S way through and fought CHARLIE 'S way up .
THE TOUGHEST PROSECUTOR I EVER HAD ON MY STAFF , MAYBE OTHER THAN ME 'd been special forces in Vietnam .
THE TOUGHEST PROSECUTOR I EVER HAD ON MY STAFF , MAYBE OTHER THAN ME was THE TOUGHEST PROSECUTOR I EVER HAD ON MY STAFF , MAYBE OTHER THAN ME .
THE TOUGHEST PROSECUTOR I EVER HAD ON MY STAFF , MAYBE OTHER THAN ME left THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA and went to work in MONTGOMERY , became AN ASSISTANT DA AND CITY JUDGE for MONTGOMERY , and for the last twenty years probably , has been circuit judge .
THE TOUGHEST PROSECUTOR I EVER HAD ON MY STAFF , MAYBE OTHER THAN ME 's now THE TOUGHEST PROSECUTOR I EVER HAD ON MY STAFF , MAYBE OTHER THAN ME .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think MILTON DAVIS was next .
MILTON DAVIS came in and MILTON DAVIS , like the rest of AN ASSISTANT DA AND CITY JUDGE , was outstanding .
MILTON DAVIS 's got a very active practice in TUSKEGEE now .
MILTON DAVIS was MILTON DAVIS .
To serve as international president of ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL FRATERNITY THAT 'S QUITE PRESTIGIOUS is quite an honor ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL FRATERNITY THAT 'S QUITE PRESTIGIOUS .
Oh , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA lost track .
MILTON DAVIS came on at SOME POINT .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think SOME POINT was A FEW YEARS later .
MILTON DAVIS 's still in THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S OFFICE .
Vanzetta Penn at that time Vanzetta Penn Durant , now Vanzetta Penn McPierson came on .
She 's now UNITED STATES magistrate in MONTGOMERY , but WE ended up having MANY , MANY OUTSTANDING BLACK ATTORNEYS come to work for WE .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think if WE had n't aggressively gone out and tried to recruit MANY , MANY OUTSTANDING BLACK ATTORNEYS , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think that a lot of MANY , MANY OUTSTANDING BLACK ATTORNEYS might not have come back to ALABAMA '' -- HE because there were no opportunities for MANY , MANY OUTSTANDING BLACK ATTORNEYS here , and WE , WE CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , would have lost these brilliant minds .
When MANY , MANY OUTSTANDING BLACK ATTORNEYS ask THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA what THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think MY BEST ACCOMPLISHMENT IN PUBLIC SERVICE is THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA say quickly , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA mean this with all THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA heart , MY BEST ACCOMPLISHMENT IN PUBLIC SERVICE 's THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION , black and white , male and female , that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA brought back to go to work for THE STATE because many of MANY , MANY OUTSTANDING BLACK ATTORNEYS would not have come back to ALABAMA '' -- HE .
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM stayed in ALABAMA '' -- HE after MANY , MANY OUTSTANDING BLACK ATTORNEYS came back .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM would have been A BRAIN DRAIN , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think that A BRAIN DRAIN 's easily A BRAIN DRAIN , being able to bring CUSTODIAL , JANITORIAL PEOPLE , OTHER THAN THOSE THAT TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS back to ALABAMA '' -- HE .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA suppose somewhere along THAT TIME WAS `` WET , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THAT TIME WAS `` WET was May of ' 71 MONTHS after THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA took OFFICE SHERIFF AMERSON , who was the FIRST elected black sheriff in modern times in THE SOUTH , had been indicted by the federal government .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA thought THAT TIME WAS `` WET would send the wrong signal for AMERSON to be removed , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA felt like AMERSON had some justification for what had happened so THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA came in and offered to defend AMERSON .
The way WE did WE was to say WE were going to start a policy to defend every law enforcement officer that was charged with a crime if WE investigated and found independently that AMERSON -- AMERSON or she , there were n't many shes back then in LAW ENFORCEMENT -- but if AMERSON had some justification for what AMERSON was doing .
WE would n't defend anybody that just was dishonest or absolutely brutal with no circumstances that might be A DEFENSE FOR WHATEVER BRUTALITY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALLEGED .
WE kept that policy up and defended MANY OFFICERS after MANY OFFICERS .
Most of MANY OFFICERS THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA tried THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think WE won all of them .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA do n't even remember now losing A CASE .
WE tried OFFICE SHERIFF AMERSON case with AN ALL WHITE JURY .
FRED GREY , A YOUNG LAWYER WHO WAS DR. KING 'S LAWYER , who is now president of the THE BAR ASSOCIATION and was ROSA PARKS WHEN THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT STARTED and MARTIN LUTHER KING 'S lawyer in the boycotts and was the FIRST black legislator elected-this was before FRED GREY , A YOUNG LAWYER WHO WAS DR. KING 'S LAWYER got elected to the legislature , of course .
FRED represented OFFICE SHERIFF AMERSON , and FRED and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA tried A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL was AN ALL WHITE JURY , but WE won A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL .
OH GOSH 's about as much background as THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA can remember right now off the top of THE HEAD OF OUR CIVIL DIVISION WHO AT THE TIME .
Okay .
Well , let 'S talk about when YOU had the grand jury on the SIXTEENTH Street case , there were a couple of other indictments handed down , one of J. B. Stoner for THE BETHEL CHURCH BOMBING and then another racially motivated murder .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON was wondering if YOU could talk A LITTLE BIT about specifically going after 'S .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON think that murder was from THE LATE '50S , even .
Sure .
Okay , when 'S started THE INVESTIGATION , 'S started from SQUARE ONE .
'S did n't have any preconceived notion whatsoever .
The FIRST thing 'S did was to send for THE STATE TROOPER FILES and asked for the Jefferson County Sheriffs files and THE BIRMINGHAM POLICE FILES , and got THEM all , and started going through THEM .
J. B. STONER were J. B. STONER and HIS GROUP .
THEM were operating out of , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think , Marietta , GEORGIA , at the time 'S started investigating .
EARLIER THEY HAD BEEN OPERATING OUT OF SAVANNAH MAYBE .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think EARLIER THEY HAD BEEN OPERATING OUT OF SAVANNAH MAYBE . was originally from Chattanooga , Tennessee , or Look Out Mountain .
As 'S developed A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL 'S had A GUY IN GEORGIA WHO KEPT WANTING TO GIVE US INFORMATION ON A KLANSMAN AND WANTING TO BE PAID , and A GUY IN GEORGIA WHO KEPT WANTING TO GIVE US INFORMATION ON A KLANSMAN AND WANTING TO BE PAID said J. B. STONER had done THE BOMBINGS .
So J. B. STONER was 'S FIRST suspect , and 'S proceeded after J. B. STONER , looking at J. B. STONER , and that trailed on for A LITTLE WHILE , and finally concluded that although J. B. STONER had done a lot of OTHER BOMBINGS J. B. STONER did n't do SQUARE ONE .
J. B. STONER did n't do THE SIXTEENTH STREET BAPTIST CHURCH , but J. B. STONER had done A LOT OF OTHERS .
J. B. STONER was mostly inept in J. B. STONER bombing .
J. B. STONER was pretty good at spreading hatred , but J. B. STONER , thank goodness , was n't too accomplished a bomber .
WE found several cases where WE felt like WE did have J. B. STONER and J. B. STONER had bombed OTHERS , but most of OTHERS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS has run out .
If YOU have A DEATH there is THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS .
A DEATH 's why WE could get MRS. CHAMBLISS , and why even recently in the last couple of THE YEARS OTHERS could go back and get BLANTON 'S and CHERRY because on A CIVIL RIGHTS MURDER , ANY MURDER , IN STATE COURT IN ALABAMA , not just A CIVIL RIGHTS MURDER , ANY MURDER , IN STATE COURT IN ALABAMA there is THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think A DEATH 's as A DEATH should be .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm glad .
But since J. B. STONER , thank goodness , J. B. STONER bombings did n't result in any deaths A DEATH did n't look like WE could do anything on any of J. B. STONER bombings .
WE think J. B. STONER was THE ONE THAT LEFT BOMBS AT THE SYNAGOGUES HERE and some of THE CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE 'S HOUSES .
So WE had to just put THE ONE THAT LEFT BOMBS AT THE SYNAGOGUES HERE on the back burner , and WE were continuing to really go after THE ONE THAT LEFT BOMBS AT THE SYNAGOGUES HERE where the deaths , THE LITTLE GIRLS were killed , SIXTEENTH STREET , and it just became obvious , like THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , J. B. STONER did A LOT OF OTHERS but not THE ONE THAT LEFT BOMBS AT THE SYNAGOGUES HERE .
YOU 've also got to bear in mind WE were n't at that point in THE INVESTIGATION , WE could n't just devote WE full time to A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL .
WE had tons of OTHER CASES , not NO CIVIL RIGHTS : corrupt sheriffs , corrupt clerks , judges , or CASES WHERE WE WERE DEFENDANTS WE had to do for THE DA that could n't or would n't do THE PROSECUTION . .
So WE would do A LITTLE BIT OF WORK on this and then have to put A LITTLE BIT OF WORK down and go do something else , and come back so A LITTLE BIT OF WORK was not A CASE that YOU could just work on a regular schedule .
Sometime around WELL NOT THE SAME TIME , or WELL NOT THE SAME TIME , after WE decided J. B. STONER was n't THE ONE THAT LEFT BOMBS AT THE SYNAGOGUES HERE , WE got a tip that THE MONTGOMERY KLAN had come up to INJURED BIRMINGHAM and done THE SIXTEENTH STREET CHURCH BOMBING , so WE went back and started working that .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was lucky there .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR had retired as the chief of detectives , assistant chief of police for the Montgomery Police Department .
When JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR was JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR had solved THE BOMBINGS in Montgomery of MARTIN LUTHER KING 'S house and THE SIXTEENTH STREET BAPTIST CHURCH , and made arrests , but THE ALL WHITE JURIES turned THE ALL WHITE JURIES loose even though THE ALL WHITE JURIES had CONFESSIONS FROM THEM .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR had brought with JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR to OUR office one of his other retired detectives that OUR 'd hired named Tom Ward who was a terrific investigator .
Trying to check down OUR tips that THE MONTGOMERY KLAN had bombed the SIXTEENTH Street Church in INJURED BIRMINGHAM , again it turned out THE ALL WHITE JURIES had n't , but THE ALL WHITE JURIES uncovered that THE MONTGOMERY KLAN had killed a young kid named WILLIE EDWARDS WHO WAS DRIVING A TRUCK FOR WINN DIXIE , so OUR followed that down and ended up getting AN INDICTMENT .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think that came after .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA do n't think OUR got that indictment until after OUR indicted for THAT BOMBING RIGHT NEAR HER though , but OUR came back to THAT BOMBING RIGHT NEAR HER and got AN INDICTMENT eventually .
In THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA opinion OUR solved A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL .
NO QUESTION WE solved A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL , but OUR could n't bring him to trial which was a tragedy .
THE TOUGHEST PROSECUTOR I EVER HAD ON MY STAFF , MAYBE OTHER THAN ME threw NO QUESTION WE out because OUR could n't prove at that time cause of death .
LATER THE PEOPLE ON THEIR DEATH BED , some of LATER THE PEOPLE ON THEIR DEATH BED , confessed to THEIR DEATH BED .
Eventually , though , the roads led to MRS. CHAMBLISS and HIS GROUP , BLANTON 'S and CHERRY , and HIS GROUP as OUR started working on BLANTON AND THEN CHERRY .
By A PRETTY HIGH JOB IN JOURNALISM OUR were several years into THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA term .
As OUR started pursuing the Chambliss group it became rather obvious to OUR that CHAMBLISS AND HIS GROUP , BLANTON AND CHERRY , AND THEIR GROUP had been CHAMBLISS AND HIS GROUP , BLANTON AND CHERRY , AND THEIR GROUP , and CHAMBLISS AND HIS GROUP , BLANTON AND CHERRY , AND THEIR GROUP had been looked at by THE OTHER INVESTIGATING AGENCIES , THE STATE AGENCIES THAT WE HAD .
CHAMBLISS AND HIS GROUP , BLANTON AND CHERRY , AND THEIR GROUP names popped up from THE BEGINNING OF THE FBI , but with THE FBI 'S CHAMBLISS AND HIS GROUP , BLANTON AND CHERRY , AND THEIR GROUP were CHAMBLISS AND HIS GROUP , BLANTON AND CHERRY , AND THEIR GROUP after THAT BOMBING RIGHT NEAR HER .
THE BEGINNING OF THE FBI got to a point where THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA knew that OUR were going to have to get access to the FBI records if OUR were going to have any success , and so THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA started trying to get THE FBI 'S cooperation and was met with one story and tale after DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT .
It is obvious now that THE BEGINNING OF THE FBI was just a delay , and shuffling , and DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT would n't say no , but DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT would give one put off after another over , and over , and over , and over again .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was patient A LOT longer than THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA should have been .
The reason THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was patient is THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA felt like that there was probably good reason for DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT to be suspicious of a deep South law enforcement agency because of the bad record DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT 'd had in the past .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THE FBI 'S is due THE FBI 'S , and DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT 're certainly DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT , and J. EDGAR HOOVER is DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT .
What DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT did to come in in THE LATE '50S and THE '60S , WHAT THEY DID , particularly in THE '60S , WHAT THEY DID THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had nothing but admiration for THE LATE '50S .
Without DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT and DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT efforts there 's OUR MAIN SUSPECT .
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , well , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm standing there reluctant .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA want to show DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT how DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT can trust THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA spent A LOT OF TIME trying to show DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT how THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had worked with THE FBI 'S as a young prosecutor , how THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA knew these agents that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA felt like would vouch for THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA , how WE certainly did n't have any connection with THE MONTGOMERY KLAN .
DESERVING OF A LOT OF CREDIT did n't get anywhere and MONTHS became THE YEARS .
WE kept trying to do WE investigation as best WE could , and that led WE more and more on WE own merits to MRS. CHAMBLISS and HIS GROUP , BLANTON 'S and CHERRY , and BLANTON AND THEN CHERRY , and WE worked A LITTLE BIT OF WORK .
But all that did was make THE INVESTIGATION more obvious that WE were going to have to have access to THE FBI 'S work to piece THE FBI 'S WORK together with WE .
Even when WE 'd get information on WE own WE needed to make sure that what WE people were telling WE was consistent with STUPID THINGS LATER THE PEOPLE ON THEIR DEATH BED had said earlier .
WE wanted to make sure .
THE MOST RELIABLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD were n't exactly THE MOST RELIABLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD , YOU know , so WE needed to double check in addition to whatever THE FBI 'S had that WE did n't know about .
But , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA did n't get anywhere with being patient .
Did n't get anywhere with reason , and begging , and everything else .
J. EDGAR HOOVER died , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA thought maybe after J. EDGAR HOOVER was gone that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA might have better luck .
Nothing changed .
Then Nixon left office , and Pat Grey left office .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA ca n't remember when Clarence Kelley came in , but anyway nothing changed with THE FBI 'S .
NO MATTER HOW MANY CHANGES OF ADMINISTRATION WE HAD THEY still would n't share anything with WE .
One day , by then THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm probably in '75 MAYBE , EVEN '76 PERHAPS , PROBABLY ' 75 , '75 MAYBE , EVEN '76 PERHAPS , PROBABLY ' 75 's probably '75 MAYBE , EVEN '76 PERHAPS , PROBABLY ' 75 , early ' 761 suspect .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was in WASHINGTON , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had a good friend that was the THE LA TIMES bureau chief named JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR originally was from ALABAMA '' -- HE .
When THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA would go to WASHINGTON THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA would try to get with JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR , and WE 'd go out to dinner or something .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'd go over to DR. KING 'S HOUSE AND HIS CHURCH .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR had been active in covering some of the civil rights bombings in SURE MISSISSIPPI on behalf of THE LA TIMES .
So WE went out one THE NIGHT , and JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR wanted to know if THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was still working on THE BOMBING CASE , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` Yeah . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think WE 've reached AN IMPASSE , '' and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA told JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR about the trouble .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR knew THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'd been working on AN IMPASSE for THE YEARS .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA told JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR about ZERO that WE had , if WE could n't get THE COOPERATION OF THE FBI THAT I DID N'T THINK WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING , AND SAID WE JUST HAD TO HAVE IT , and all the troubles and years THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'd gone through trying to get THE COOPERATION OF THE FBI THAT I DID N'T THINK WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING , AND SAID WE JUST HAD TO HAVE IT .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA can help YOU if YOU want THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA to . ''
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR said , `` If YOU do n't think ZERO 's meddling , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll do what THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA can to help YOU .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA know ZERO 's ZERO . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` Man , yeah , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA wish YOU would . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` ZERO ca n't hurt US .
US ca n't get any less than what US 're getting now .
ZERO 's ZERO .
ZERO 's not going to dry them up any . ''
So HE said , `` All right .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll see what THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA can do . ''
So THE NEXT DAY HE called THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA at the hotel .
HE said , `` YOU know WE plotted this thing of THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA helping YOU with THE FBI 'S , and WE had had A LOT to drink .
Do YOU still want THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA to do that in the cold light of morning ? '' THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` Yeah .
Absolutely .
NO QUESTION WE
No downside here . ''
By A PRETTY HIGH JOB IN JOURNALISM GERALD FORD is GERALD FORD , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm trying to remember who BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA was .
A PRETTY HIGH JOB IN JOURNALISM was either LEVI OR SAXBY , one or THE OTHER INVESTIGATING AGENCIES , THE STATE AGENCIES THAT WE HAD , but JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR knew LEVI OR SAXBY from THE FBI 'S WORK .
A PRETTY HIGH JOB IN JOURNALISM 's A PRETTY HIGH JOB IN JOURNALISM being Washington Bureau Chief for THE LA TIMES .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR goes up there to THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S OFFICE and bypasses THE FBI 'S .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR says JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR 's working on A BIG STORY , and A BIG STORY 's not going to be A BIG STORY A BIG STORY 's going to be a whole series of stuff , and that THE FBI 'S is covering up for THE KILLERS OF THE LITTLE GIRLS and that THE KILLERS OF THE LITTLE GIRLS wo n't cooperate with ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ALABAMA WHO 'S GOT A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION , HAS LEGITIMATE CREDENTIALS TO PROVE HE 'S NOT CONNECTED WITH THE KLAN , AND IS on the verge of solving ALABAMA '' -- HE , but THE FBI 'S is blocking THE FBI 'S , and that ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ALABAMA WHO 'S GOT A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION , HAS LEGITIMATE CREDENTIALS TO PROVE HE 'S NOT CONNECTED WITH THE KLAN , AND IS had gotten permission from HIS BOSSES AT THE LA TIMES -- which THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA suspect ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ALABAMA WHO 'S GOT A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION , HAS LEGITIMATE CREDENTIALS TO PROVE HE 'S NOT CONNECTED WITH THE KLAN , AND IS made up -- that HIS BOSSES AT THE LA TIMES were going to run THE LA TIMES as a front page series for THOSE DAYS .
THE KILLERS OF THE LITTLE GIRLS were going to bring the kids ' parents , and grand parents , and THEIR FAMILIES up , and WE were going to have press conferences on THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 'S steps , and THE KILLERS OF THE LITTLE GIRLS were going to play THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 'S up and send THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 'S out on THE KILLERS OF THE LITTLE GIRLS wire service .
So THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S PR GUY said , `` Oh , well give WE SOME TIME .
Let WE look into SOME TIME . ''
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S PR GUY said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll give YOU A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME . ''
About THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME would have been two weeks , they called JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR back .
Turn A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME off again .
Okay .
Let A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME see .
All right .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was with JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR .
UM-HUM .
So THEY called UM-HUM . back and said that THEY were willing to cooperate .
GREAT .
And give us access to THEY files .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had just hired a friend of mine that had been sheriff for A WHILE .
OUR MAIN SUSPECT , had been in LAW ENFORCEMENT in Huntsville and had come to work as AN INVESTIGATOR AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE or so before .
OUR MAIN SUSPECT had n't been working on THE BOMBING CASE .
A GUY named BOB EDDY .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA called A GUY and said , `` BOB EDDY , WE have been working on THIS BOMBING CASE FOR YEARS , but THIS BOMBING CASE FOR YEARS 's been hits and misses , BITS AND PIECES , BITS AND PIECES .
WE work on THIS BOMBING CASE FOR YEARS and put THIS BOMBING CASE FOR YEARS down .
Now THIS BOMBING CASE FOR YEARS looks like WE 're getting ready to get access to THE FBI 'S files .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA want YOU to stop what YOU 're doing .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm going to stop any assignments of any other work and YOU 're FULL TIME ON THE BOMBING CASE .
Go to INJURED BIRMINGHAM and get YOU a motel room for however long -- .
Okay , WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON think YOU can go ahead .
So BOB EDDY closed out BOB EDDY cases that BOB EDDY was working on , turned them over to other people .
BOB EDDY came to INJURED BIRMINGHAM and established a relationship with the FBI office , got A MOTEL ROOM , and went to work FULL TIME ON THE BOMBING CASE on A MOTEL ROOM .
Then WE really started rolling .
If INJURED BIRMINGHAM had n't been for BOB EDDY , well , if INJURED BIRMINGHAM had n't been for Jack Nelson making THE FBI 'S finally cooperate WE never would have been able to bring THE PROSECUTION . , and if THE FBI 'S had n't been for BOB EDDY coming up here and putting all the pieces together and fitting THE FBI 'S in with what WE already had , WE would n't have made INJURED BIRMINGHAM work .
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll always be grateful and indebted to BOB EDDY and JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR both .
Of course INJURED BIRMINGHAM turns out , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA only learned this the last couple of years when BOB EDDY AND JACK NELSON tried BLANTON 'S and CHERRY , that the FBI in spite of telling WE BOB EDDY AND JACK NELSON were cooperating still held out on WE and did n't give WE everything .
It turns out BOB EDDY AND JACK NELSON only gave BOB EDDY AND JACK NELSON though WE had anyway .
Really ?
Yeah .
If BOB EDDY would ask for something , for SOMETHING WE ALREADY HAD , BOB EDDY AND JACK NELSON 'd let BOB EDDY have what BOB EDDY AND JACK NELSON had on SOME ASPECT OF EQUAL RIGHTS , but THE STUFF THAT HE DID N'T KNOW TO ASK ABOUT THEY would n't volunteer .
WE did n't realize WE .
It turns out THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think WE could have convicted Blanton for sure back when WE convicted MRS. CHAMBLISS and maybe CHERRY also , although CHERRY would be A LITTLE BIT more iffy because a lot of stuff that CHAMBLISS AND HIS GROUP , BLANTON AND CHERRY , AND THEIR GROUP convicted CHERRY on came out of CHERRY own mouth after THE FACT , bragging about what CHERRY had done .
Right .
But BLANTON 'S THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think for sure WE could have convicted back when WE did MRS. CHAMBLISS .
So YOU did n't have access to any of the tapes that WE used or did n't know anything about BLANTON 'S ?
OUR MAIN SUSPECT .
OUR MAIN SUSPECT .
Well , WE knew A LOT about OUR MAIN SUSPECT .
OUR MAIN SUSPECT was WE main suspect .
Oh , okay .
OH YEAH .
WE knew BLANTON 'S CAR was BLANTON 'S CAR .
WE knew OUR MAIN SUSPECT was driving BLANTON 'S CAR .
Oh , okay .
But like the ID WE had .
WE had a positive ID of MRS. CHAMBLISS , and a positive ID of BLANTON 'S car , but not a positive ID of BLANTON 'S .
Things like that-there was NO QUESTION WE .
In fact WE suspects were BLANTON 'S , CHERRY , and MRS. CHAMBLISS , and then some other people that helped .
There was one other one with CHAMBLISS AND HIS GROUP , BLANTON AND CHERRY , AND THEIR GROUP .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA vented at THE FBI 'S about this and got THE FBI 'S out of THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA system kind of .
And THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA do n't blame THE ONES DOING IT EVEN THOUGH THE ONES NOW , IT HURTS THEIR FEELINGS TO BE CRITICIZED now .
THE ONES DOING IT EVEN THOUGH THE ONES NOW , IT HURTS THEIR FEELINGS TO BE CRITICIZED were n't there .
THE ONES DOING IT EVEN THOUGH THE ONES NOW , IT HURTS THEIR FEELINGS TO BE CRITICIZED were n't THE ONES DOING IT EVEN THOUGH THE ONES NOW , IT HURTS THEIR FEELINGS TO BE CRITICIZED .
But THE ONE OF THE '60S AND '70S is not THE ONE OF THE '60S AND '70S , and even saying that , the average agent was n't at fault .
Had THE ONE OF THE '60S AND '70S not been for THE FBI 'S there would n't have been anything .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA shudder to think what would have happened in THE SOUTH WITH RACIAL HATE CRIMES back then .
THE SOUTH WITH RACIAL HATE CRIMES does n't mean that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THEY 're all bad .
THEY did A LOT OF GOOD there .
WE ended up deciding just to indict MRS. CHAMBLISS .
Okay .
For several reasons , and A LOT OF GOOD was A LOT OF GOOD .
WE evidence on MRS. CHAMBLISS was stronger than on BLANTON AND THEN CHERRY , and MRS. CHAMBLISS also was MRS. CHAMBLISS .
MRS. CHAMBLISS was THE ONE THAT LEFT BOMBS AT THE SYNAGOGUES HERE .
All the others were HATERS , and all of them were violent , bad people but HATERS were HATERS .
If YOU 'd have removed Chambliss from the scene back then and had all the others here , YOU would n't have had VERY MANY BOMBINGS .
So WE felt like not only getting MRS. CHAMBLISS , but if WE got MRS. CHAMBLISS , MRS. CHAMBLISS was the one HATERS thought was the toughest and it might be easier to come back and get some of BLANTON AND THEN CHERRY to talk on BLANTON AND THEN CHERRY , if WE got MRS. CHAMBLISS .
Then THE BAD SIDE was , since WE had a stronger case against MRS. CHAMBLISS , if WE went ahead and indicted all of them MRS. CHAMBLISS was older and not in that good of health .
WE thought HATERS could come in and get a severance .
Back then HATERS were entitled to severances pretty well , which means YOU get a separate trial .
Oh .
And CLAIM THAT CHAMBLISS ' HEALTH PREVENTED HIM FROM GOING ON TRIAL , AND MAKE US go to trial with one of the ones that WE did n't have as good of evidence on .
Then if WE got a not guilty that would have knocked CLAIM THAT CHAMBLISS ' HEALTH PREVENTED HIM FROM GOING ON TRIAL , AND MAKE US in THE HEAD OF OUR CIVIL DIVISION WHO AT THE TIME forever .
Nobody could have ever done anything .
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` WE 'll just go with MRS. CHAMBLISS and then come back and try to get BLANTON AND THEN CHERRY . ''
But then one other thing THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA wanted to be sure THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA came back to .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA mentioned J. B. STONER had been WE FIRST suspect and done a lot of VERY MANY BOMBINGS , but just not THE SIXTEENTH STREET CHURCH BOMBING , and that THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS had run .
But WE found , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA ca n't remember who in THE ONE OF THE '60S AND '70S found this .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THE ONE OF THE '60S AND '70S might have been John Young who was one of my assistant attorneys general .
Somebody said , `` YOU know , that CHURCH , SHUTTLESWORTH CHURCH , is just right up inches away from THE CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE 'S HOUSES . ''
CHURCH , SHUTTLESWORTH CHURCH 's not like a church with a big parking lot around CHURCH , SHUTTLESWORTH CHURCH and up on a hill by CHURCH , SHUTTLESWORTH CHURCH .
THE CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE 'S HOUSES were occupied .
THESE PEOPLE lived in THESE PEOPLE , and under THE ALABAMA LAW there is no statute of limitations for setting off EXPLOSIVES dangerously near an occupied dwelling .
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` YOU know , THESE PEOPLE 's worth A TRY . ''
So what WE indicted MRS. CHAMBLISS for -- THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm sorry -- what WE indicted J. B. STONER for -- WE could prove THE BOMBING CASE -- was not setting off THE BOMB at THE CHURCH BECAUSE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAD RUN ON THAT .
Nobody got hurt .
Nobody got killed .
WE could n't prosecute THE BOMBING CASE , so WE indicted MRS. CHAMBLISS for setting off EXPLOSIVES dangerously near an occupied dwelling house .
MRS. CHAMBLISS technically was convicted -- not technically -- MRS. CHAMBLISS was convicted , not of THE BETHEL CHURCH BOMBING , but of setting THE BETHEL CHURCH BOMBING off close to THE CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE 'S HOUSES that were right up there next to THE CHURCH BECAUSE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAD RUN ON THAT .
THE BETHEL CHURCH BOMBING 's THE BETHEL CHURCH BOMBING .
Let THE BETHEL CHURCH BOMBING see .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA do n't know how much YOU want to get into THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL .
Yeah , let 'S .
ART HANES were ART HANES and ART HANES son Art Junior .
GREAT LAWYERS 're GREAT LAWYERS and great people .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA really like and have a lot of respect for the Haneses .
GREAT LAWYERS 're GREAT LAWYERS , and GREAT LAWYERS represented GREAT LAWYERS clients well , and GREAT LAWYERS tried A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL well .
A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL was A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL .
We had A JURY , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think there were NINE WHITES and THREE BLACKS , or TEN OF THEM whites and TWO blacks .
Thank goodness NINE WHITES did ZERO and found MRS. CHAMBLISS guilty .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA can still think back to a lot of emotions THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm just thankful THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was able to play a part in some long overdue justice .
MRS. CHAMBLISS was MRS. CHAMBLISS .
Of course , WE were doing a lot of other injuries to WE back in THOSE DAYS then without THOSE DAYS , but THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm just glad THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was able to be a part of finally bringing that FIRST part of FIRST to trial , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm glad that A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AT THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL was A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AT THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL .
A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AT THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL came down and watched some of WE trial .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AT THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL watched MY FINAL ARGUMENT .
MY FINAL ARGUMENT somehow inspired A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AT THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL where THE YEARS later when BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA was BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA reopened A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL and came back and got BLANTON 'S and then CHERRY .
MY FINAL ARGUMENT was kind of funny about how A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AT THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL was able to do MY FINAL ARGUMENT .
MY FINAL ARGUMENT showed pretty good cooperation .
MY FINAL ARGUMENT came out that A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AT THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL had reopened A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL as BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA called A YOUNG LAW STUDENT AT THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL .
DOUG 'S A GREAT COURTROOM LAWYER , DOUG 'S A GREAT COURTROOM LAWYER .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA know BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA well and tried A LOT OF CASES with BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA and against BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA called THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA to tell THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA what BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA was doing .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA saw A LOT OF CASES in the paper .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA might have called HIM OR HE called THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA ca n't remember .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA , how in THE WORLD are YOU going to be able to do anything ? THE FEDERAL STATUTE ran THE YEARS ago .
There 's nothing in the world YOU can do if HIM OR HE come out and confess on SIXTEENTH STREET . ''
BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA said , `` Well , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA know that . ''
BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA said , `` There 's noting about THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAT SAYS THAT A GRAND JURY CA N'T INVESTIGATE SOMETHING , AND AFTER WE FINISH WITH OUR INVESTIGATIONS , then WE 'll see if WE can make state prosecution and let THE STATE prosecute . ''
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAT SAYS THAT A GRAND JURY CA N'T INVESTIGATE SOMETHING , AND AFTER WE FINISH WITH OUR INVESTIGATIONS is what happened .
Then BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA
BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA
David Barber , THE DA here , cooperated like THE DA had done with THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
THE DA 's THE DA , especially for THESE PEOPLE .
But THE DA was another thing that triggers MEMORIES .
Back when THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was trying to be patient with THE FBI 'S and trying to explain to THESE PEOPLE the logic of where THESE PEOPLE ought to cooperate and share , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA would tell THESE PEOPLE , `` YOU know , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA understand .
YOU 're talking to a guy that 's AN INVESTIGATOR and A PROSECUTOR A PROSECUTOR .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA understand YOU ca n't let somebody come in and mess up A CASE OF YOURS by sharing YOU stuff , but YOU have A CASE OF YOURS .
THE FEDERAL STATUTE has run so YOU can not have a case for anybody to mess up .
THE FEDERAL STATUTE 's impossible for the Feds to do anything .
If THESE PEOPLE were to run out and say , ' THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA did THE FEDERAL STATUTE , yeah , yeah , yeah , ' there 's nothing that YOU could do federally to THESE PEOPLE .
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS had passed . ''
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS was another thing that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA could n't understand and still do n't .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA know the reasons THESE PEOPLE gave never were logical and still are n't .
So why did THE FBI 'S close A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL ?
Well , THESE PEOPLE had to .
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ran on THESE PEOPLE .
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS sounds like maybe THESE PEOPLE had enough evidence ?
Well , NO MATTER HOW MANY CHANGES OF ADMINISTRATION WE HAD THEY is NO MATTER HOW MANY CHANGES OF ADMINISTRATION WE HAD THEY that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA can take THE BAD SIDE on .
Yes , THESE PEOPLE had enough evidence .
THESE PEOPLE had MORE EVIDENCE than what THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA had to convict MRS. CHAMBLISS , but , and A BIG is A BIG but -- THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA mentioned early on when THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was talking about JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR , saw MARTIN LUTHER KING 'S house and church bombing in MONTGOMERY and got CONFESSIONS FROM THEM , and THE ALL WHITE JURIES turned THE ALL WHITE JURIES loose even with CONFESSIONS FROM THEM .
But back in THOSE DAYS when THE FEDERAL STATUTE ran out in THE '60S , WHAT THEY DID YOU only had white men on juries in most of ALABAMA '' -- HE anywhere , and in most counties THREE BLACKS .
THOSE DAYS was true not only in ALABAMA '' -- HE but in SURE MISSISSIPPI and other parts of the deep South , so when YOU would find A FEW COURAGEOUS PROSECUTORS THAT WOULD WORK UP A CASE , and a few courageous law enforcement officers that would make A FEW COURAGEOUS PROSECUTORS THAT WOULD WORK UP A CASE , A FEW COURAGEOUS PROSECUTORS THAT WOULD WORK UP A CASE would invariably go before an all white , all male jury , and no matter what MORE EVIDENCE A FEW COURAGEOUS PROSECUTORS THAT WOULD WORK UP A CASE had , A FEW COURAGEOUS PROSECUTORS THAT WOULD WORK UP A CASE 'd turn A FEW COURAGEOUS PROSECUTORS THAT WOULD WORK UP A CASE loose .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think that THOSE DAYS was THOSE DAYS , that J. EDGAR HOOVER felt like THOSE DAYS even with THE GOOD EVIDENCE THEY HAD IT STILL was n't THE GOOD EVIDENCE THEY HAD IT STILL .
People like to be critical about J. EDGAR HOOVER about everything .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA can take THE BAD SIDE on that issue .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA can see where J. EDGAR HOOVER would say , `` WE ought not to run the risk of acquittal , '' with THE WAY JURIES were doing .
But THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA ca n't take THE BAD SIDE in not later sharing that with J. EDGAR HOOVER , to bring THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION that THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION knew were guilty , and THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION knew were J. B. STONER , to help WE prosecute A CHANCE , especially to act like and make WE think that THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION were helping .
And in A WAY THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA reckon THE WAY JURIES were .
THE WAY JURIES just were n't doing A WAY .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA told THE WAY JURIES later , `` ZERO is ZERO and YOU definition of cooperation is not THE SAME THING . ''
So STUPID THINGS had changed by ' 77 , or even by ' 71 ? YOU started the A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION , A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION , ' 71 ?
Seventy-one .
January of ' 71 .
So YOU knew STUPID THINGS had changed enough by then that YOU could get A CONVICTION ?
Well , YOU never know that for sure .
YOU know though that YOU 've got A REASONABLE CHANCE if YOU have the right kind of evidence and present A REASONABLE CHANCE right .
A REASONABLE CHANCE 's still A REASONABLE CHANCE , and it was made more uphill because of THE LENGTH OF TIME that THE LENGTH OF TIME had gone on .
If YOU take RACE OUT OF IT , it would be difficult to get A JURY sometimes to go back and on an old case like A REASONABLE CHANCE , with no racial factors , NO CIVIL RIGHTS factors , A DEFENSE FOR WHATEVER BRUTALITY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALLEGED has got a built in argument about MEMORIES fade , and blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
So it was n't any iron clad cinch we could get A CONVICTION , and RACE OUT OF IT certainly was n't for DOUG JONES -- DOUG JONES either in DOUG JONES -- DOUG JONES TWO recent prosecutions of BLANTON 'S and CHERRY .
But THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS times juries in THE STATE OF ALABAMA did ZERO .
THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS 's THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS .
Let THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS talk A LITTLE BIT about the witnesses at THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL .
What were sort of the key moments , or THE KEY WITNESSES ?
Well , there were THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS or FOUR in MRS. CHAMBLISS .
There were also THREE OF MY GREAT GRANDFATHERS or FOUR that might have been that would n't testify .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think probably the FIRST one YOU 've got to start with was A LADY FROM DETROIT named Miss Kirthus Glenn .
A LADY FROM DETROIT had been in INJURED BIRMINGHAM THE NIGHT of THAT BOMBING RIGHT NEAR HER , and was staying in a house right behind THE CHURCH BECAUSE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAD RUN ON THAT , and saw the bomb being planted , and saw BLANTON 'S CAR , and identified THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION .
THE NEXT DAY A LADY FROM DETROIT told THE FBI 'S and THE BIRMINGHAM POLICE , told THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION what A LADY FROM DETROIT had seen , picked out BLANTON 'S CAR and when THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION showed A LADY FROM DETROIT a bunch of pictures A LADY FROM DETROIT picked MRS. CHAMBLISS out .
A LADY FROM DETROIT said THE DOME LIGHT -- MRS. CHAMBLISS was the only one A LADY FROM DETROIT could identify .
A LADY FROM DETROIT identified BLANTON 'S CAR , picked BLANTON 'S TO A T out to A T .
But A LADY FROM DETROIT went back to DETROIT and did n't want to ever come back to ALABAMA '' -- HE after THAT BOMBING RIGHT NEAR HER .
So when WE found A LADY FROM DETROIT , and this was before THE FBI 'S , WE found A LADY FROM DETROIT name from THE BIRMINGHAM POLICE FILES .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA sent investigators to DETROIT .
WE found A LADY FROM DETROIT , and JACK SHAWS AND I ca n't remember who else , went up there and talked to A LADY FROM DETROIT .
A LADY FROM DETROIT was very gracious to JACK SHAWS AND I , let JACK SHAWS AND I come in A MOTEL ROOM , told JACK SHAWS AND I everything , and remembered everything clearly , but A LADY FROM DETROIT refused to come back and agree to testify .
When JACK SHAWS AND I came back and told THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` Well , the witness is n't going to be any good if A LADY FROM DETROIT wo n't come back . ''
Now YOU can make THE KEY WITNESSES come back across state lines .
YOU could n't back then in STATE COURT IN ALABAMA .
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` THE KEY WITNESSES just have n't tried .
Make sure YOU tell HER things are different now .
We 'll protect HER . ''
HER was afraid to come back .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA thought THEY just had n't done it properly , so THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA sent THEY back up there .
And THEY came back a second time and said THEY could n't make any headway with HER .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` YOU all are just -- . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA did n't say INCOMPETENT .
If THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA did INCOMPETENT was in a laughing way .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll go up there with YOU . ''
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA got one of the black assistant attorneys general , MILTON DAVIS -- Governor Wallace had let US use the state plane to fly all over on A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL .
So US flew back , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think THE THIRD TIME was THE THIRD TIME , and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` YOU all just watch THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll show YOU how THE THIRD TIME 's done . ''
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA still could n't get THE THIRD TIME done .
SHE would n't do THE THIRD TIME .
SHE was just terrified .
But we noticed , JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR had told THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA THIS , that JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR 'd noticed THIS before .
SHE had out A JET MAGAZINE FROM THE '50S THAT HAD A PICTURE OF ROSA PARKS WHEN THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT STARTED , A JET MAGAZINE FROM THE '50S THAT HAD A PICTURE OF ROSA PARKS WHEN THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT STARTED .
Of course , ROSA PARKS WHEN THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT STARTED lived down SIXTEENTH STREET from ROSA PARKS WHEN THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT STARTED in Detroit at THAT TIME WAS `` WET , and apparently was one of her heroines .
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA picked up A JET MAGAZINE FROM THE '50S THAT HAD A PICTURE OF ROSA PARKS WHEN THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT STARTED and thumbed through A BIG STORY on ROSA PARKS WHEN THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT STARTED .
JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR had told JACK SHAWS , WHO WAS MY CHIEF INVESTIGATOR .
There was A PICTURE OF FRED GREY , A YOUNG LAWYER WHO WAS DR. KING 'S LAWYER .
Now FRED had become REALLY GOOD FRIENDS .
Early in THIS INTERVIEW , if YOU might remember , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA was telling FRED and THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA defended OFFICE SHERIFF AMERSON together , okay ? FRED by A PRETTY HIGH JOB IN JOURNALISM was in the ALABAMA '' -- HE legislature , and we were REALLY GOOD FRIENDS and still are .
Like THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA say , FRED 's FRED right now , state bar .
So THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA asked FRED would OFFICE SHERIFF AMERSON take off and fly up there for a fourth time .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA said , `` If MARTIN LUTHER KING 'S lawyer comes up A CHARMING FELLOW and promises YOU that everything is okay and YOU 'll be safe , will YOU believe MARTIN LUTHER KING 'S LAWYER ? '' And SHE says , `` Well , OH YEAH , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'd be hard pressed not to believe MARTIN LUTHER KING 'S LAWYER . ''
And so WE flew back , and FRED flew up there with WE , and sure enough , when SHE got convinced that FRED was THE SAME one A PICTURE OF FRED GREY , A YOUNG LAWYER WHO WAS DR. KING 'S LAWYER was in SHE Jet Magazine and was MARTIN LUTHER KING 'S lawyer , SHE agreed that SHE 'd come back and testify .
Can YOU turn THE SAME off JUST A MINUTE ?
Yeah , sure .
Let THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA finish THE MOST VOTES EVER RECEIVED UP TO THAT POINT highlights of THE KEY WITNESSES .
Okay .
YOU ready ?
Go ahead .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm running out of AN EXCITING YEAR TO BE THERE so we can schedule another session sometime .
Okay .
Let THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA skip .
The best witness though was MRS. CHAMBLISS niece , ELIZABETH COBBS .
Now BOB EDDY was THE ONE THAT LEFT BOMBS AT THE SYNAGOGUES HERE .
Okay .
So BOB EDDY went to ELIZABETH COBBS and ELIZABETH COBBS aunt because HER AND HER AUNT would n't agree to testify for A WHILE .
HER AND HER AUNT brought THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA up here .
BOB EDDY really spent A LOT OF TIME with HER AND HER AUNT and got the trust of HER AND HER AUNT .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA came up and talked to HER AND HER AUNT and decided ELIZABETH COBBS 'd be a terrific witness .
Finally BOB EDDY got ELIZABETH COBBS to agree to testify .
MRS. CHAMBLISS did n't ever know .
MRS. CHAMBLISS wife and CHAMBLISS ' WIFE sister who 's ELIZABETH COBBS , and ELIZABETH COBBS had been giving information to THE FBI 'S all during THE YEARS .
MRS. CHAMBLISS wife had been passing THE FBI 'S on .
THE FBI 'S 's amazing .
We had THE SAME THING IN MONTGOMERY in the WILLIE EDWARDS WHO WAS DRIVING A TRUCK FOR WINN DIXIE case .
The wife of the one of the guilty people would n't agree to testify .
SOME OF THESE WHITE WOMEN WHO WERE WIVES OF THESE KLANSMAN just could n't go along with SOME OF THESE WHITE WOMEN WHO WERE WIVES OF THESE KLANSMAN husband 's behavior and were very , very brave .
But YOU still had to protect SOME OF THEM and could n't let SOME OF THEM be THE KEY WITNESSES .
It turns out that SOME OF THEM had hidden microphones in MRS. CHAMBLISS house for THE FBI 'S and other things .
But ELIZABETH COBBS was THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT IN THE TRIAL WHEN SHE CAME IN , WHEN SHE TESTIFIED , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think , in winning and losing A HARD FOUGHT , TOUGH TRIAL .
THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT IN THE TRIAL WHEN SHE CAME IN , WHEN SHE TESTIFIED was to THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT IN THE TRIAL WHEN SHE CAME IN , WHEN SHE TESTIFIED .
YOU could look over at MRS. CHAMBLISS and YOU could tell .
MRS. CHAMBLISS was looking with hatred .
YOU could tell .
MRS. CHAMBLISS looked like MRS. CHAMBLISS 'd been hit with a severe blow when SHE walked in that courtroom .
THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think without SHE testimony we would n't have won .
Of course YOU 've got THE ONE THAT I WOULD RATE ABOVE ALL OTHERS AS BEING THE DIFFERENCE , but THE ONE THAT I WOULD RATE ABOVE ALL OTHERS AS BEING THE DIFFERENCE 's THE ONE THAT I WOULD RATE ABOVE ALL OTHERS AS BEING THE DIFFERENCE .
THE ONE THAT I WOULD RATE ABOVE ALL OTHERS AS BEING THE DIFFERENCE was a very brave THE SAME THING IN MONTGOMERY to do .
SHE was a very troubled person later .
Had some kind of supposed sex change operation and passed away .
But SHE and SHE aunt did what was right at the time of THE BOMBINGS , and did what was right at THE TIME OF THE CHAMBLISS TRIAL , and MRS. CHAMBLISS wife did too .
In fact , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'll close by telling a story that HIS SON ART JUNIOR told THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA , fairly recently , TWO or three years ago .
HIS SON ART JUNIOR told THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA that after the -- now YOU 've got to understand .
Let THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA backtrack .
Apparently EVEN A LOT were also , CHERRY particularly , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA think BLANTON 'S also , but THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA know CHERRY was , were VISCOUS PEOPLE .
VISCOUS PEOPLE were VISCOUS PEOPLE .
VISCOUS PEOPLE mistreated THEIR FAMILIES , mistreated THEIR WIVES , mistreated women in BUT AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
VISCOUS PEOPLE were bullies of the worst kind .
HIS SON ART JUNIOR told THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA that after the guilty verdict came down , of course VISCOUS PEOPLE carried MRS. CHAMBLISS away in handcuffs .
HIS SON ART JUNIOR 'd been out on bond , but VISCOUS PEOPLE carried HIS SON ART JUNIOR to jail .
So HIS SON ART JUNIOR said that MY DAD 'S assigned MY DAD 'S the job of going to tell MRS. CHAMBLISS .
Of course VISCOUS PEOPLE did n't know that she had been cooperating and stuff like VISCOUS PEOPLE .
So HIS SON ART JUNIOR says HIS SON ART JUNIOR gets over to CHAMBLISS ' HOUSE and THE CURTAINS were all drawn , and even on THE DOOR THE CURTAINS were drawn .
No lights on even though CHAMBLISS ' HOUSE 's in the early afternoon around noon .
HIS SON ART JUNIOR said HIS SON ART JUNIOR knocks on THE DOOR , and finally A LADY FROM DETROIT say , `` Who is THE DOOR ? '' HIS SON ART JUNIOR says , `` HIS SON ART JUNIOR .
Can THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA come in MRS. CHAMBLISS ? '' A LADY FROM DETROIT says , `` Yes , come in . ''
HIS SON ART JUNIOR says HIS SON ART JUNIOR went in and HIS SON ART JUNIOR said A MOTEL ROOM was so dark and so musty , and they 've got curtains and blinds keeping THE DOME LIGHT out , and A LADY FROM DETROIT 's laying over there on the couch .
HIS SON ART JUNIOR thinks , `` Oh , AS BAD AS SHE feels AS BAD AS SHE 's going to be EVEN A LOT more awful when THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA tell A LADY FROM DETROIT . ''
HIS SON ART JUNIOR said , `` MRS. CHAMBLISS , THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm sorry to tell YOU that THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 've got to come tell YOU that A JURY found BOB EDDY guilty , '' or Robert guilty .
WHATEVER WHATEVER called HIS SON ART JUNIOR .
HIS SON ART JUNIOR said , `` WHATEVER convicted HIS SON ART JUNIOR of murder . ''
SHE said , `` What 's going to happen to HIS SON ART JUNIOR ? '' HIS SON ART JUNIOR said , `` Well , HIS SON ART JUNIOR 's going to go to prison . ''
SHE said , `` Well , is HIS SON ART JUNIOR coming home ? '' HIS SON ART JUNIOR said , `` No , WHATEVER took HIS SON ART JUNIOR to jail . ''
SHE said , `` Well , when will HIS SON ART JUNIOR be coming home ? '' HIS SON ART JUNIOR said , `` THE LAST BAXLEY IN MY ANCESTRAL LINE THAT WAS NOT BORN IN ALABAMA 'm afraid HIS SON ART JUNIOR wo n't be MRS. CHAMBLISS .
WHATEVER 'll carry HIS SON ART JUNIOR off to THE PENITENTIARY .
