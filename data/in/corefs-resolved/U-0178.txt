Today is June twenty-third , 2006 and SARAH THUESEN am at THE HOME OF SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SARAH THUESEN name is SARAH THUESEN and SARAH THUESEN am conducting this interview for OUR LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT , OUR LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT .
Thanks so much for sitting down with SARAH THUESEN today .
Since THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA have talked with US , I THINK , WHO WERE WRAPPED UP IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION before about some of YOUR EARLIER ACTIVISM , particularly regarding the school desegregation component of YOUR EARLIER ACTIVISM , SARAH THUESEN thought US , I THINK , WHO WERE WRAPPED UP IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION would start more kind of in THE MID-70S and go from there .
FIRST SARAH THUESEN wanted THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA to help SARAH THUESEN set the scene for what was going on in THE LOUISVILLE .
In THE MID-70S , US , I THINK , WHO WERE WRAPPED UP IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION had had the open housing legislation passed .
THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA 'd had a school deseg plan put in THE PLACE .
Was there any moment during THOSE YEARS WHERE YOU FELT LIKE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS OVER ? YOUR GENERAL SENSE OF WHERE THINGS WERE HEADED was THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA general sense of where THE THINGS were headed ?
Well , THOSE OF US , I THINK , WHO WERE WRAPPED UP IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION could n't think that THOSE OF US , I THINK , WHO WERE WRAPPED UP IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION was over , because THE BEGINNING OF A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY was THE BEGINNING OF A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY and this is 2006 .
A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY has been to try and get for BLACK KIDS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS an equitable educational opportunity and to try and get for BLACK KIDS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS an educational opportunity that did n't involve suspensions , multiple suspensions , or did n't involve disproportionate corporal punishment .
So A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY even though US , I THINK , WHO WERE WRAPPED UP IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION desegregated THE BUILDINGS in 1975 , US , I THINK , WHO WERE WRAPPED UP IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION really did not do anything to dismantle racism .
So no , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY never thought LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT was dead and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY used SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY experience with THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION in JEFFERSON COUNTY AS A PLATFORM from which to launch OUR TITLE IX PROJECT .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was employed at A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE JEWISH INTELLECTUALS by THE LOUISVILLE and JEFFERSON COUNTY HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had started that THE JOB were ordered to desegregate .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY came to work .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was hired to be THE WOMEN 'S rights director , but the agency was so small , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY turned out to be the only one in this five-person agency who had any knowledge of what was supposed to be happening in THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
So from THE MOMENT SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY walked in THE DOOR , after seeing every THE LOUISVILLE policeman lined up in the parking lot across THE STREET FROM OUR OFFICE , because the police department was right across THE STREET FROM OUR OFFICE , in riot gear , which was one of the most chilling sights SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ever saw in THE LOUISVILLE , from the moment SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY walked in THE DOOR , THE MOMENT was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , THE MOMENT had to be THE WOMEN 'S RIGHTS DIRECTOR to make sure that THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS were adhering to the court order and to see where there were VIOLATIONS , WHAT I PERCEIVED TO BE VIOLATIONS OF AN ORDER THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO RESULT IN EQUITABLE DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS TO WHITE AND BLACK KIDS , or SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY perceived violations of the deseg order , and THE WOMEN 'S were numerous .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY spent every other Tuesday night at THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT .
So JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and the pro-deseg people and the THE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL PEOPLE and THE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL PEOPLE .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , there would be AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE JAMMED INTO THAT BUILDING .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've always said that ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST BYPRODUCTS OF THE LAWSUIT was ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST BYPRODUCTS OF THE LAWSUIT And that went on for A COUPLE YEARS that YOU had all THE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL PEOPLE , THE LIBERALS FROM THE EAST END , THE LIBERALS FROM THE EAST END , THE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL PEOPLE , THE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL PEOPLE .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , OUR were all out there .
OUR got to know EACH OTHER .
EACH OTHER was really fascinating .
But SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was there specifically to raise THESE ISSUES about VIOLATIONS , WHAT I PERCEIVED TO BE VIOLATIONS OF AN ORDER THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO RESULT IN EQUITABLE DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS TO WHITE AND BLACK KIDS .
Almost from the very beginning , disproportionate suspensions was like in YOU face .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was out there for A COUPLE YEARS watching what WHITE AND BLACK KIDS were doing and in THE PROCESS , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started to realize that whatever THE PROCESS was WHITE AND BLACK KIDS were doing bad for BLACK KIDS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , WHITE AND BLACK KIDS were doing bad for THE GIRLS FOR THE , for FEMALE STUDENTS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had become aware of a project that THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN had got funding for called the PEER Project-Project for Equal Educational Resources or some such .
The PEER Project had devised THESE QUESTIONNAIRES to be used by monitors in OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS to determine the degree to which TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS was being complied with .
Now TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS , TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS 's sort of interesting THE WAY all this interacted .
THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION LAWSUIT was filed in ' 72 .
It was n't effective until Judge Gordon demanded that THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION LAWSUIT happen in September-I think it was SEPTEMBER or maybe SEPTEMBER was August-of ' 75 , VERY FEW PEOPLE HAD .
TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS , TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS annoys SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY to this very day , THIRTY YEARS later , that newspapers and other groups refer to Title IX as if IX only related to ATHLETICS .
TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS relates to everything , counseling , curriculum , opportunities for TEACHERS , everything .
What sort of violations of Title IX with regard to gender were THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA seeing ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm about to tell YOU .
OH OKAY , OKAY .
Because OH 's one of the high points of THE RICHEST LIFE .
OH was just so joyful .
THIS is all by NO WAY .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY wrote to THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY went up there .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY know SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY went up there a couple of TIMES WHEN I PERPETUATED THAT to WASHINGTON .
At any rate , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got copies of THIS survey instruments and THIS had survey instruments for everybody , for FEMALE STUDENTS , for TEACHERS , for PRINCIPALS , for COACHES , for THEIR PARENTS , for vocational education teachers , for assistant principals , for SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS , for THE SUPERINTENDENT AGAIN of THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , there were TWELVE OF THEM or THIRTEEN DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY looked at THIS and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought , `` Boy , THIS is really cool if SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY could get THOSE PEOPLE to go into THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS and could get THIS to use THIRTEEN DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS to find out what THE SCHOOL SYSTEM is doing vis-a-vis THE SCHOOL SYSTEM female population . ''
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was young , let 'S do n't forget .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was much younger and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had an enormous amount of energy and an enormous amount of rage in terms of inequities of any kind .
At THE SAME TIME SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY proceeded to go out into THE COMMUNITY and recruit THESE VOLUNTEERS .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY went to THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JEWISH WOMEN .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY went to THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY went to CHURCH WOMEN 'S groups .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY went to any organized woman 's group SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY could think of and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY announced at CHURCH WOMEN 'S GROUPS meetings that WE needed to know how WE schools were treating WE girls and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY needed THESE VOLUNTEERS in order to implement this survey .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ended up with about THIRTY different volunteers .
One of the assistant principals-no , HE was assistant superintendent of THE SCHOOL SYSTEM , AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN FRIEND OF MINE , AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN FRIEND OF MINE , told SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY to call a woman who worked at the Race and Sex Desegregation Center in FLORIDA .
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN FRIEND OF MINE had done SOME TRAINING FOR HIM .
THE NAME OF IT was Dr. NORMA MERTZ and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY called and AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN FRIEND OF MINE came up for free .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had THESE VOLUNTEERS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had a massive meeting .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had food , but SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm not sure .
Being A JEWISH MOTHER , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY probably did .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ca n't remember exactly .
WE had one of the meeting training sessions over at the THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS building .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ca n't remember where WE had the SECOND one , but WE did have THOSE TWO different trainings .
WE took CHURCH WOMEN 'S and NORMA MERTZ was wonderful .
NORMA MERTZ told CHURCH WOMEN 'S very explicitly what TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS allowed and what TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS did n't allow .
And THAT WOMEN 'S are THAT WOMEN 'S .
So NORMA MERTZ 's teaching THAT WOMEN 'S about a law that had been enacted , THE THING was passed in '72 and became effective in ' 75 , VERY FEW PEOPLE HAD , that could be a great tool for WE women to use to secure for WE women the same kind of equitable education that guys got , supposedly .
After doing SOME TRAINING FOR HIM twice in THOSE TWO different groups and WE were very clear in talking to CHURCH WOMEN 'S that if WE found VIOLATIONS , WHAT I PERCEIVED TO BE VIOLATIONS OF AN ORDER THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO RESULT IN EQUITABLE DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS TO WHITE AND BLACK KIDS in THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , that WE would write A LETTER to the THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS , which had enforcement authority , so that WE had a tool that WE could use against THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS if CHURCH WOMEN 'S were violating TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS .
So THE NEXT THING I HAD TO DO was get permission from THE SCHOOL SYSTEM to let THE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL PEOPLE in .
The only reason SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was able to get THE NEXT THING I HAD TO DO was because THE ACTING SUPERINTENDENT OF THE JEFFERSON COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM , A MAN NAMED DAVE DERUZZO , had been brought in to sort of clean up THE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL PEOPLE system .
THE ACTING SUPERINTENDENT OF THE JEFFERSON COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM , A MAN NAMED DAVE DERUZZO was sort of A HATCHET MAN and THE ACTING SUPERINTENDENT OF THE JEFFERSON COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM , A MAN NAMED DAVE DERUZZO saw SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY as being a principle catalyst in the racial change in THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
THE ACTING SUPERINTENDENT OF THE JEFFERSON COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM , A MAN NAMED DAVE DERUZZO believed that THE ACTING SUPERINTENDENT OF THE JEFFERSON COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM , A MAN NAMED DAVE DERUZZO better do this .
And THE ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD DRAFTED THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION PLAN was THE ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD DRAFTED THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION PLAN and THE ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD DRAFTED THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION PLAN was AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN FRIEND OF MINE .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY called HIM AND I said , `` FRANK RAPLEY , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY want to get THESE VOLUNTEERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS to see where we stand on sex equity . ''
THE ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD DRAFTED THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION PLAN said , `` Well , send SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY THIRTEEN DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'll look HIM AND I over . ''
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY sent HIM AND I the whole thing and THE ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD DRAFTED THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION PLAN said , `` Okay , '' which was truly amazing .
If THE SCHOOL SYSTEM had n't been in such a state of fluid flux because of deseg , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY never would have gotten HIM AND I into there .
There is NO WAY .
WE turned HIM AND I loose and HIM AND I usually went in teams and HIM AND I interviewed PRINCIPALS , COACHES , FEMALE STUDENTS , THEIR PARENTS , all these different interest groups .
Then WE sent a second group in .
WE had THOSE TWO groups .
At the end of THE PERIOD OF TIME that THE PERIOD OF TIME took for A VERY FASTIDIOUS WOMAN to do THESE SURVEYS , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY took THESE SURVEYS and with a friend a mine , who worked for THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE , A LITTLE OFFICE HERE MONITORING SCHOOLS , and A VERY FASTIDIOUS WOMAN was A VERY FASTIDIOUS WOMAN .
Who was that ?
THE NAME OF IT was MARIAN KEYES and A VERY FASTIDIOUS WOMAN 's now in West Virginia , a wonderful woman .
A VERY FASTIDIOUS WOMAN was very precise .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did everything half-assed and slapdash .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY wanted THE RESULTS and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was always ahead of SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm not a careful person .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't balance SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY checkbook .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't even know what SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've got in the bank most of THE SAME TIME .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY go to an ATM machine to see .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY hate that kind of stuff .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY can only do what SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY can do when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm working with somebody like MARIAN KEYES , who crosses the t 's and the dots on THE i 's .
So when WE get all these results back , MARIAN KEYES and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got together and WE had to read every ONE of these questionnaires that WE volunteers turned on .
After WE read ONE and compiled THE RESULTS , WE found TWENTY-EIGHT violations of TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS .
After finding that , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY drafted A LETTER to THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS in ATLANTA alleging that THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT was in massive violation of TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY listed every one of the violations .
Is THIS interesting to THIS ?
Yeah .
Having gotten A LETTER , THIS contacted SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT and said that THIS were sending up A TEAM TO LOOK INTO THE SCHOOLS TO SEE IF THEY COULD SUBSTANTIATE OUR CLAIM OF VIOLATION .
THIS sent up SIX people who were here for one THE WEEK fanning out and going into THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS and checking THAT WOMEN 'S .
The head of A TEAM TO LOOK INTO THE SCHOOLS TO SEE IF THEY COULD SUBSTANTIATE OUR CLAIM OF VIOLATION just love THIS , THE HEAD OF THE TEAM FOR OCR , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just love THIS , THE HEAD OF THE TEAM FOR OCR was A WOMAN NAMED MARGE JUSTICE .
A WOMAN NAMED MARGE JUSTICE was blonde and beautiful and buxom .
A TEAM TO LOOK INTO THE SCHOOLS TO SEE IF THEY COULD SUBSTANTIATE OUR CLAIM OF VIOLATION was just perfect .
So THIS , THE HEAD OF THE TEAM FOR OCR go back to ATLANTA after THIS , THE HEAD OF THE TEAM FOR OCR do THIS ON-SITE and THIS ON-SITE was n't very long , about A MONTH later , THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got A LETTER .
THIS , THE HEAD OF THE TEAM FOR OCR substantiated twenty-seven of THE TWENTY-EIGHT VIOLATIONS .
THE ONE THAT THEY DID N'T SUBSTANTIATE , WHICH I THINK was THE ONE THAT THEY DID N'T SUBSTANTIATE , WHICH I THINK , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY alleged that corporal punishment was used on THE BOYS ' and not on THE GIRLS FOR THE .
THIS , THE HEAD OF THE TEAM FOR OCR did n't consider that A VIOLATION .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know what A VIOLATION is .
A VIOLATION 's chivalry dies hard .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , get rid of corporal punishment .
So when all A VIOLATION happened , there was REALLY-OH WHAT YEAR WAS THIS ? THIS must have been in ' 77 .
So THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS are embroiled in deseg and now REALLY-OH WHAT YEAR WAS THIS 're going to be embroiled in TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS . MARGE JUSTICE comes up to meet with the administration in THE BOARD ROOM at headquarters .
THE BOARD ROOM had THIS HUGE LONG TABLE as board rooms want .
Every damned principal and assistant principal and superintendent is sitting around THIS HUGE LONG TABLE .
Of course , in those days , to be a superintendent , YOU had to be A WOMAN COACH .
All the superintendents had been COACHES .
So COACHES go through this letter issue by issue and say , `` Well , okay .
WE 'll try and do something about WE . ''
COACHES were resistant , but COACHES were n't passionately resistant until WE get to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY complaint that THE GIRLS FOR THE basketball practice was at mealtime .
THE GIRLS ' GAMES were at mealtime and THE BOYS ' games were after HIS DINNER .
All hell broke loose when SHE starts telling THE GIRLS FOR THE THE GIRLS FOR THE have to alternate .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , HIS DINNER was like the world is going to end next Wednesday .
THE GIRLS FOR THE were visibly shaken when SHE told THE GIRLS FOR THE that THE GIRLS FOR THE 's what THE GIRLS FOR THE had to do .
There were A COUPLE more things like that A COUPLE were athletically-inclined .
-LSB- A CRUCIAL QUESTION -RSB- -LSB- RECORDER is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
Getting back to TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS , every issue involving ATHLETICS just freaked THE GIRLS FOR THE out .
Spending the same amount of money on TROPHIES , `` Oh SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY God , WE ca n't do TROPHIES .
WE do n't have enough money . ''
WE was crazy .
Uniforms , `` Oh SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY God , WE ca n't do WE . ''
Travel by bus instead of getting THEIR PARENTS to get THEIR PARENTS to the game , `` Oh SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY God , WE ca n't do WE . ''
Every single thing that touched on ATHLETICS was like poison .
SHE just sat there and SHE was just totally unruffled : `` Well , YOU have to do ATHLETICS .
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM gets x amount of millions of dollars in federal financial assistance and YOU do n't want to lose THE SCHOOL SYSTEM . ''
So the long and the short of THE SCHOOL SYSTEM was that THEY agreed .
SHE said SHE would be back in , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think , THREE MONTHS SHE gave THEY to see what kind of progress THEY 'd made , and SHE left .
The next thing that happens is SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY get A CALL from THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT FOR PUBLIC INSTRUCTION inviting SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY to have LUNCH WITH HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY happened to like THE SUPERINTENDENT AGAIN very much , A HATCHET MAN , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY really liked A HATCHET MAN .
THE SUPERINTENDENT AGAIN had no hidden agenda .
THE SUPERINTENDENT AGAIN did n't bullshit .
THE SUPERINTENDENT AGAIN let YOU know YOUR GENERAL SENSE OF WHERE THINGS WERE HEADED - .
THE SUPERINTENDENT AGAIN was just never playing politics .
So WE went out to lunch and THE SUPERINTENDENT AGAIN says , `` SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would really like YOU to come to work for THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT as A TITLE IX COORDINATOR .
And who was THE SUPERINTENDENT AGAIN ?
DAVE DERUZZO .
Okay , WE was DAVE DERUZZO . .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought , `` Pretty crafty . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` Oh , DAVID .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'd be really interested in doing that with two strings attached . ''
DAVID said , `` What are THEY ? '' SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , and this was , mind YOU , back in THE 70S , `` Well , YOU have to pay SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY fifty thousand dollars and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'd have to report directly to YOU . ''
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY never heard from THEY again .
THEY advertised for A TITLE IX COORDINATOR and A LOT OF PEOPLE SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY knew applied and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY organized A MEETING OF ALL THE APPLICANTS at one of our houses THE WEEK before THEY were going to have the interviews , and explained to THEY how important A MEETING OF ALL THE APPLICANTS was to THAT WOMEN 'S that THAT WOMEN 'S had some power , that TITLE IX , WHICH WAS THE FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT ANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAD TO PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO GIRLS AND BOYS have some power , and that THEY are n't going to have power if YOU go to work for THEY for seventeen thousand dollars and report to a minority affairs superintendent .
So everybody agreed THEY would n't take THE JOB unless certain conditions were met .
Well , THE JOB went to A WOMAN COACH , but HERSELF was part of THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
A few things changed for awhile , but not THE WAY THEY should have .
A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME is that in terms of ATHLETICS , THE SCHOOL SYSTEM started being really responsive to THE GIRLS FOR THE once NO FATHERS started filing complaints and NO FATHERS did , in soccer particularly .
Once DADS got into A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME , A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME was A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME .
Interesting .
Yeah , and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know what 's going on over there now .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm sure that there 's a lot of problems , but THE THINGS were shaken up for awhile to a degree that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think DADS could have , there is no way DADS would ever return to THE PLACE DADS were .
And ATHLETICS was so terribly important because SOME OF THESE GIRLS were never going to get to college without an athletic scholarship .
SOME OF THESE GIRLS was an economic issue , pure and simple .
Were SOME OF THE VIOLATIONS CONCERNING CLASSROOM PRACTICES ?
SOME OF THE VIOLATIONS CONCERNING CLASSROOM PRACTICES were violations that included steering away , let 'S steer THE GIRLS FOR THE away from HIGHER MATH .
SOME OF THE VIOLATIONS CONCERNING CLASSROOM PRACTICES do n't have THE CAPACITY TO DO HIGHER MATH .
In terms of CLASSROOM PRACTICES , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't remember too much of CLASSROOM PRACTICES .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY remember that SOME OF THE VIOLATIONS CONCERNING CLASSROOM PRACTICES were stopped from programming girls into home ec and boys into woodworking .
SOME OF THE VIOLATIONS CONCERNING CLASSROOM PRACTICES changed A LOT .
THE CLASSROOM PRACTICE THAT I 'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH AS A FEMINIST is THE CLASSROOM PRACTICE THAT I 'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH AS A FEMINIST .
But THE CLASSROOM PRACTICE THAT I 'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH AS A FEMINIST 's probably still going on .
SARAH THUESEN want to back up to something THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA said A FEW MINUTES ago .
THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA said THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA were really ready to take on this challenge , because THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA had enormous rage on THESE ISSUES .
Where did that rage come from ?
Well , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think all rage comes from a realization that something is unjust .
ONE DAY MANY YEARS ago , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know , ten years ago , ELEVEN YEARS ago , one of the really good writers for the newspaper here before ONE DAY MANY YEARS was sold to Gannett called and asked SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY if SHE could interview SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , because SHE said that SHE 'd really always been interested in MY WORK .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would love for YOU to interview SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would love anything that would encourage-exposure ONE DAY MANY YEARS would encourage other women to choose the path SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've chosen . ''
So SHE came out and SHE wrote A REALLY LONG , LONG ARTICLE , which YOU could probably get from the archives .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have A COPY OF IT HERE , but A COPY OF IT HERE 's probably yellowed .
Ask SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY to look later .
SHE name is DIANE APRILE .
-LSB- A CRUCIAL QUESTION -RSB- -LSB- RECORDER is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
So anyway , in the course of interviewing SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY for this very long interview , DIANE APRILE and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , we were sitting downstairs and DIANE APRILE SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said immediately , `` Hmm .
Nobody 'S ever asked SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY that before . ''
Then SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said without skipping A BEAT , `` Injustice .
A BEAT just pisses SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY off . ''
And THAT WHOLE QUOTE was in the paper and all SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY women THE AMERICAN FRIENDS thought , `` Oh , yes . ''
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- `` We love THAT WHOLE QUOTE that YOU used that word . ''
But THAT WHOLE QUOTE does .
THAT WHOLE QUOTE really , really makes SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY - .
Now where did THAT WHOLE QUOTE come from ? SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have NO IDEA , but THAT WHOLE QUOTE just changes SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY whole body and changes what 's happening .
When I WITNESS SOMETHING that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think is unjust , WITNESS SOMETHING just makes SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY furious .
All YOU have to do is get injustice embedded in a big system and pretty soon , fury turns to rage .
Were there particular injustices that THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA had experienced as a woman that really had made an impact on THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA ?
Absolutely .
Can THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA give SARAH THUESEN an example of something ?
When SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was THIRTY YEARS old , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY husband received an award that was to be given in FLORIDA and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'd never been to FLORIDA and MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME told SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME would take SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
So we went to FLORIDA for this conference .
FLORIDA was FLORIDA .
At A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE JEWISH INTELLECTUALS , A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE JEWISH INTELLECTUALS was A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE JEWISH INTELLECTUALS and the JEWISH community nationally has always had a disproportionate number of intellectuals who are spinning THIS and that and EACH OTHER .
THE THING lasted three days and on the last night , THIS had a discussion .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm so sorry , SARAH THUESEN .
-LSB- A CRUCIAL QUESTION -RSB- -LSB- RECORDER is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
On THE LAST DAY OF THE CONFERENCE , WHICH WAS A VERY BIG DEAL CONFERENCE FOR THE NATIONAL JEWISH COMMUNITY , SARAH THUESEN had A DISCUSSION ON OPEN HOUSING .
So THIS would have been 1963 when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was maybe THIRTY .
-LSB- interruption -RSB-
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was THIRTY YEARS old .
THIS had A DISCUSSION ON OPEN HOUSING and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm sitting at a table with eight of us all from THE LOUISVILLE and FIVE men .
After A DISCUSSION ON OPEN HOUSING was over from EIGHTEEN MINUTES , we 're sitting around the table having coffee and THE MEN 'S started talking about what THE MEN 'S heard and what THE MEN 'S thoughts were .
What SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm about to tell YOU , SARAH THUESEN , is A REALLY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE .
A REALLY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE really ended up being THE FORMATIVE EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE .
So THE MEN 'S are talking about open housing and whether or not THE MEN 'S thought THE SAME TIME was right to really proceed in THE LOUISVILLE and what the difficulties might be and blah blah blah .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think THE MEN 'S were all lawyers .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` Well , YOU know - . ''
And there 's psst .
THAT was THAT .
Nobody recognized SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY or heard SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and THEY kept on talking .
A FEW MINUTES later , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` Well SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think , '' and THEY just talked over SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did that THREE times .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY tried to become part of the conversation THREE times .
THREE times SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was ignored .
When THE GROUP , THAT THE GROUP 'S GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE BIRTH TO IT disbanded and everyone went back to their hotel room , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY walked in and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY threw SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY across the bed and started sobbing in frustration and anger .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY husband , who was A NICE MAN , but A NICE MAN was n't where A NICE MAN really should have been at THE SAME TIME , said , `` SUZY KLING , honey , what 's THE MATTER ? '' SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` What 's THE MATTER ? '' ? '' SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY tried to get into the discussion YOU were having at THE TABLE THREE TIMES and THREE times SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was ignored and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm as smart as THOSE MEN WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE STRATEGY OUGHT TO BE IN LOUISVILLE .
And nobody let SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY in . ''
MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME said , `` Oh SUZY KLING . ''
THE SAME TIME was THE SAME TIME .
`` OH SUZY KLING , of course YOU 're as smart as any of us . ''
SUZY KLING said , `` But YOU have to understand that THEY see YOU as A JEWISH WIFE and mother .
THEY 's how THEY see YOU . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was never going to be not heard again .
So from 1930 -LSB- Post probably meant to say here from AGE THIRTY ON -RSB- on , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started building a presence for SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY outside of THE HOME OF SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started FIRST in A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY moved from A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN to the McCarth - .
Started learning , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had to learn A LOT .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got more involved in THE NATIONAL ACLU than SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had been .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just started doing whatever SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY could do to accumulate experience so that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY could climb whatever stairs SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had to climb to own MY OWN VOICE and to make MY OWN VOICE heard .
MY OWN VOICE was one of the most painful experiences SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ever had in THE RICHEST LIFE .
And to THIS DAY , THIS DAY brings tears to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY eyes to think that , `` Oh , honey dearest , YOU 're just YOU . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think without THIS DAY , that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would have probably-I know without THE FORMATIVE EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would n't be who SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ended up being , because SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would n't have had to , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would n't have had to .
THIS DAY 's really interesting , but SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started learning more and more and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started doing more and more and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started developing more and more power and eventually became one of the most powerful women in the social justice movement in THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY .
And THIS DAY was very conscious .
So when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY say injustice pisses SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY off , THIS DAY was probably THIS DAY all .
And THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA said THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA were about THIRTY YEARS old , so SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was about -
' 63 .
' ' 63 . , okay .
Once THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA started getting really involved , SARAH THUESEN mean by THE MID-70S , THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA had of course been involved in lots of different movements .
Once THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA started getting involved more closely in THAT WOMEN 'S movements , how did THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA husband feel about THAT WOMEN 'S ?
Well , MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME was pretty - .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY guess MID-70S got to the point where MID-70S did n't matter to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY what MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME thought about MID-70S .
MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME did n't really become supportive of what SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was doing until 1975 when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ran for the legislature .
MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME , as long as supper was on THE TABLE THREE TIMES and BLACK KIDS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS were taken care of - .
At one point , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said something about A JOB and MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME said , `` No wife of mine is going to have A JOB . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME was really old-school , but MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME changed too .
THREE TIMES forced MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME to change and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was changing so fast that MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME did n't really have a choice ; MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME had to .
MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME was very , very happy in MY WORK and MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME adored MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME children .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was not that consequential really , which was probably lucky for SARAH THUESEN .
But THE WOMEN 'S movement became extremely important to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
And THE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT , ISSUES THAT SAY IN THE EARLY 70S , YOU REALLY THOUGHT WERE GOING TO TAKE OFF AND THEN NEVER DID 's really interesting , SARAH THUESEN , that when THOSE PEOPLE think of SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY today , THOSE PEOPLE think of SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY in terms of racial justice and housing .
SARAH THUESEN do n't really think of SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY as having been a women 's right activist and yet SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY contribution to THE WOMEN 'S movement was probably more significant than anything else SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've done .
Why do THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA think THOSE PEOPLE do n't remember that part of YOUR CAREER as much ?
Because SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think THE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT , ISSUES THAT SAY IN THE EARLY 70S , YOU REALLY THOUGHT WERE GOING TO TAKE OFF AND THEN NEVER DID 'S 'S important anymore , if THE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT , ISSUES THAT SAY IN THE EARLY 70S , YOU REALLY THOUGHT WERE GOING TO TAKE OFF AND THEN NEVER DID ever was to most people .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , THE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT , ISSUES THAT SAY IN THE EARLY 70S , YOU REALLY THOUGHT WERE GOING TO TAKE OFF AND THEN NEVER DID 's what SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think .
And there has n't been A VIABLE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT , A VIABLE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT here for THIRTY YEARS .
So A VIABLE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT 's probably another reason .
There 's nothing , no screen to look at A VIABLE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT from .
There 's a book that GENIE POTTER did on LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY women and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had LUNCH WITH HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT not too long ago .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` GENIE , why did n't YOU interview SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ? '' GENIE POTTER said , `` Well , there 's AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE JAMMED INTO THAT BUILDING , '' but SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think GENIE POTTER just was n't cognizant of all the change that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've provoked .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think GENIE 's true of A LOT OF PEOPLE .
THE WOMEN 'S movement sort of died , YOU know ? THE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT SORT 's so sad , because there 's still so much to be done .
But THE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT SORT just kind of died and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think THE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT SORT died at THE SAME TIME that it was obvious THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT was n't going to go anywhere .
Well , to back up and talk about some of the contributions THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA feel like THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA did make on THAT WOMEN 'S issues , YOUR GENERAL SENSE OF WHERE THINGS WERE HEADED comes to THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA mind as THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA most significant contribution ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY most significant contribution was forcing THE NATIONAL ACLU to deal with sex discrimination and create THAT WOMEN 'S Rights Project that Ruth headed up , which resulted in all kinds of litigation across THE COUNTRY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION had all kinds of incredible results .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ; SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY know SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION was significant .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that there 's WHEN I LEFT , 1990 that A BIG CONTRIBUTION has been A BIG CONTRIBUTION to the women of this state .
And THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA created that in what year ?
WHEN I LEFT , 1990 was WHEN I LEFT , 1990 .
Could THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA go back and say A LITTLE BIT more about THE ACLU WORK YOU DID ON WOMEN 'S ISSUES ? THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA were chair of THAT WOMEN 'S committee on THAT WOMEN 'S rights , is that right ?
Can YOU turn A LITTLE BIT off a minute ? -LSB- Recorder is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
THE NATIONAL ACLU national board , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started organizing to get more women elected to THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT and then SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started getting the few of us who were there to meet at every board meeting and the board meetings were only every other month .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would run out and get sandwiches and run back .
YOU had to have A TON OF ENERGY to do what SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did .
A TON OF ENERGY 's insane .
WE 'd sit in a room and WE 'd talk about the issues that were on THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT or the issues that were n't on THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT and should be .
WE caucus just grew and grew and grew until the national staff realized they needed to get WE A SPECIAL ROOM TO HAVE THESE THINGS IN .
So A SPECIAL ROOM TO HAVE THESE THINGS IN got very institutionalized and A SPECIAL ROOM TO HAVE THESE THINGS IN was really important in increasing the numbers of minorities and GAYS AND LESBIANS .
A SPECIAL ROOM TO HAVE THESE THINGS IN started with THAT WOMEN 'S , got that , had almost fifty-fifty from the affiliates because of measures that WE put into effect , moved on to THAT MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS , less successful there because THE NATIONAL ACLU did n't appeal to THAT MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS , moved on to GAYS AND LESBIANS , oh boy , great .
So now THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN is much more diverse than THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN was .
By organizing that caucus , THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN just had a lot of long-term results that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY hear about to this THE LAST DAY OF THE CONFERENCE , WHICH WAS A VERY BIG DEAL CONFERENCE FOR THE NATIONAL JEWISH COMMUNITY .
And THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA were going to THESE NATIONAL MEETINGS IN NEW YORK -
Once A MONTH .
Once A MONTH for how many years ?
TWELVE OF THEM .
Twelve years .
Now THESE NATIONAL MEETINGS IN NEW YORK , TWELVE OF THEM were executive committee meetings and FOUR OF THEM were board meetings with AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ATTACHED .
Then there would be A BIG NATIONAL CONFERENCE and so A BIG NATIONAL CONFERENCE was another opportunity to organize THAT WOMEN 'S .
A BIG NATIONAL CONFERENCE was great .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just loved A BIG NATIONAL CONFERENCE .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was crazy , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was just crazy .
And MOST OF THIS was in THE 70S .
THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA said MOST OF THIS was about from '69 to ' 80 , is that when THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA - .
A REALLY HOT , REALLY HOT ISSUE was not only to make THE NATIONAL ACLU more diverse , but also to bring THESE ISSUES before the ACLU dealing with THAT WOMEN 'S .
What sorts of THESE ISSUES were THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA dealing with ?
If SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY remember correctly , WE were dealing with affirmative action .
A REALLY HOT , REALLY HOT ISSUE was A REALLY HOT , REALLY HOT ISSUE , because a disproportionate number of the THE NATIONAL ACLU national board were ACADEMICS and a disproportionate number of the THE NATIONAL ACLU board were JEWS , and JEWS had historically been shut out of higher education by quotas .
In fact , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had been told by A JEWISH MOTHER when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was FIFTEEN , while WE were washing dishes and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY announced SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY wanted to go to medical school , that FIFTEEN was impossible because ACADEMICS had a quota for THE GIRLS FOR THE and a quota for JEWS : `` YOU 'll never get in . ''
Affirmative action was a really big issue for THAT WOMEN 'S to promote in terms of THE NATIONAL ACLU taking THE RIGHT POSITION , because there was A LOT OF RESISTANCE among THESE MALE ACADEMICS , THESE MALE ACADEMICS , but there was A LOT OF RESISTANCE to affirmative action .
Did THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA sense that there was more resistance on affirmative action with regard to WOMEN OR MORE RESISTANCE WITH REGARD to -
WOMEN OR MORE RESISTANCE WITH REGARD
Awful .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , there was just a huge amount of sexism in THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN .
WOMEN OR MORE RESISTANCE WITH REGARD were products of THE SAME TIME .
THE SAME TIME 's very hard to rehabilitate SEXISTS .
THE ONLY WAY IT CAN HAPPEN is if SEXISTS moms decide that THEIR MOMS 're going to raise DIFFERENT CHILDREN .
Can THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA remember any particular comments or discussions among these male academics about affirmative action ?
THE GIRLS ' GAMES
THE ONLY WAY IT CAN HAPPEN was always done in a veiled kind of way .
Nobody came out and said - .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ca n't even remember precisely .
THE ONLY WAY IT CAN HAPPEN was very charged , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY remember that .
VERY CHARGED DEBATES were VERY CHARGED DEBATES and one of the men on the national board , who was A VOLUNTEER GENERAL COUNCIL , WHO WAS A LAW PROFESSOR FROM RUTGERS AND THE HEAD OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CLINIC AND A VERY , VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE , WAS VERY OPPOSED .
A VOLUNTEER GENERAL COUNCIL , WHO WAS A LAW PROFESSOR FROM RUTGERS AND THE HEAD OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CLINIC AND A VERY , VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE , WAS VERY OPPOSED said THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF COLOR AND GENDER are just totally different .
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF COLOR AND GENDER 's just so much worse .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had a gazillion discussions with A VOLUNTEER GENERAL COUNCIL , WHO WAS A LAW PROFESSOR FROM RUTGERS AND THE HEAD OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CLINIC AND A VERY , VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE , WAS VERY OPPOSED and would get angry .
Finally , somehow , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know , over THE SAME DAMN THING , A COUPLE OF YEARS changed A COUPLE OF YEARS mind and realized THE SAME DAMN THING was THE SAME DAMN THING .
THE RIGHT POSITION was every man 'S got A NIGGER in A NIGGER household somewhere and she 's probably wiping A NIGGER kids ' bottoms and 'S want to keep THE RIGHT POSITION NO WAY .
'S just do n't see THE RIGHT POSITION .
'S just can not see THE RIGHT POSITION .
'S 're too close to THE RIGHT POSITION .
THE RIGHT POSITION 's pretty insidious .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm sure that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY husband believed in MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME heart that MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME did n't feel NO WAY and yet every Passover when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would have twenty-one of our family to MY HOUSE FOR PASSOVER SERVICE , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would do all this work , because SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was working too .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have to organize a meal and make matzo ball soup and da da da da da , all THAT STUFF .
Ugh .
YOU start THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE and two days in advance and YOU have to be an engineer to get THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE right .
And YOU come home from THE ACLU WORK YOU DID ON WOMEN 'S ISSUES that THE EVENING say THREE o'clock , so that YOU can get everything set up .
And at six o'clock in THE EVENING , YOU husband walks in THE DOOR and walks to the head of THE TABLE THREE TIMES and sits down .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY began to really resent THE HELL out of THE HELL .
There were TIMES WHEN I PERPETUATED THAT .
So getting rid of THAT STUFF by WOMEN OR MORE RESISTANCE WITH REGARD and by THOSE MEN WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE STRATEGY OUGHT TO BE IN LOUISVILLE , THAT STUFF just takes a really long time .
To raise YOU children asexually just is n't easy .
It really is true that THE BOYS ' go for the trucks and THE GIRLS FOR THE - .
THE really is not easy .
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO is try and show THE BOYS ' that the roles in the family between the mom and the dad are as devoid of some of that baggage as possible .
YOU 're never going to eradicate THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO all .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , WE 're different .
WE 're different .
Aside from THE ACLU WORK YOU DID ON WOMEN 'S ISSUES THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA were doing , THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA also were THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA -
THE KENTUCKY ALLIANCE , OF WHICH I WAS A CHARTER MEMBER .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have really created here FOUR OF THEM organizations of which SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm very proud .
THE NATIONAL ACLU was moribund when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY took FOUR OF THEM over .
There had n't been a director for A LONG TIME .
A LONG TIME was moribound , did n't exist .
So there was that one .
There was the Kentucky Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty , which is still operative .
There is THE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM PROJECT AT THE ACLU IN KENTUCKY and THE METROPOLITAN HOUSING COALITION .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm an entrepreneur .
THE PRO-ERA ALLIANCE ? was really fun .
THE PRO-ERA ALLIANCE ? was AN ORGANIZING JOB and AN ORGANIZING JOB 's what all AN ORGANIZING JOB was .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did THE PRO-ERA ALLIANCE ? pretty much the same way SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did MHC -LSB- Metropolitan Housing Coalition -RSB- .
YOU go to FOUR ORGANIZATIONS OF WHICH I 'M VERY PROUD and ask FOUR ORGANIZATIONS OF WHICH I 'M VERY PROUD to endorse THE PRO-ERA ALLIANCE ? and send a representative and YOU call demonstrations and YOU try to get FOUR ORGANIZATIONS OF WHICH I 'M VERY PROUD to get SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS out .
THE PRO-ERA ALLIANCE ? was not hard .
So in general , THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA felt like THE PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY IN LOUISVILLE was fairly united behind FOUR ORGANIZATIONS OF WHICH I 'M VERY PROUD ?
THE PRO-ERA ALLIANCE ?
Yeah .
Not at all .
OH , SO BY SAYING IT was n't hard -
OH , SO BY SAYING IT was n't hard , but it was n't the progressive community SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was trying to organize , because THE PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY IN LOUISVILLE really was much more into racial justice than gender justice .
ANNE BRADEN 'S , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think ANNE BRADEN 'S really was ANNE BRADEN 'S .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think THE KENTUCKY ALLIANCE , OF WHICH I WAS A CHARTER MEMBER , really gave much thought to gender justice .
THE KENTUCKY ALLIANCE , OF WHICH I WAS A CHARTER MEMBER 's all racial .
THE KENTUCKY ALLIANCE , OF WHICH I WAS A CHARTER MEMBER was all racial .
And MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS knows , there 's so much .
WE 've got so many racial justice problems here .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did , while SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was with THE NATIONAL ACLU , when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was president , convene THE FIRST CIVILIAN POLICE REVIEW BOARD , which was just amazing .
WE had , as members of THE GROUP , THAT THE GROUP 'S GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE BIRTH TO IT , THE NATIONAL ACLU .
There were like NINE groups , Church Women United .
And THE WHITE GROUPS were in because back in ' 69 , white kids with long hair in THE EAST END were getting hassled by the cops and THEIR PARENTS did n't like 69 .
So THAT SORT OF BROUGHT IT ALL TOGETHER .
THAT SORT OF BROUGHT IT ALL TOGETHER was fun .
So THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA created that board in what year ?
'68 OR ' 69 .
Okay , right on the heels of '68 OR ' 69 . .
Yeah , and then SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started organizing in the gay community , because they were having a terrible time .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think there 's A COMMUNITY around except the Christian fundamentalists .
THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA mean , THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA do n't really see A COHERENT PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY ? There are lots of different ones , is that what THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA mean ?
A COHERENT PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY 's gotten more mutually supportive so that when there 's A GAY AND LESBIAN PROBLEM , YOU 'll get the ACLU out and the Fellowship of Reconciliation out .
If NOW exists at THE MOMENT , NOW will get out .
THE MOMENT 's gotten much better .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY tried to do what YOU 're suggesting when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was working .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY guess SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was still at THE NATIONAL ACLU .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY tried to pull together A COALITION OF CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS and THE NAACP was THE NAACP , THE NATIONAL ACLU , THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN , FOR , THREE or FOUR OF THEM other groups .
A COALITION OF CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS just never gelled .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY really felt that WE should have more COMMUNICATION AMONG US ON A REGULAR BASIS , so SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did try to do A REGULAR BASIS .
COMMUNICATION AMONG US ON A REGULAR BASIS just did n't happen .
THE SAME TIME was n't right .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think THE SAME TIME will happen at some point in the future ; SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know when .
How much support were THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA able to get locally for THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT ?
WE got A LOT OF SUPPORT for THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT .
WE got A LOT OF SUPPORT for the impeachment campaign .
THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT , WE got all these middle-class women , like Women Trial Lawyers ' Association .
WE got GROUPS like THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS and the Kentucky Nurses Association and the Kentucky Education Association .
It was n't hard to get support for WE .
Were there folks that THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA expected would support THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS who did not ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ca n't remember .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ca n't remember .
Was ANNE BRADEN 'S supportive ?
THE GIRLS ' GAMES , ANNE BRADEN 'S really was n't .
IT 's not that ANNE BRADEN 'S was opposed to IT .
IT 's just not where ANNE BRADEN 'S priorities were and ANNE BRADEN 'S had a limited amount of time and energy like the rest of us .
ANNE BRADEN 'S did n't do anything to stop IT or anything .
ANNE BRADEN 'S just was n't in there .
On a related note , THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA attended the International Women 's Year Conference in HOUSTON , WHICH HAD TEN THOUSAND WOMEN in ' 77 , right ?
Tell SARAH THUESEN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE .
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE was A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE .
WE had had A STATE CONFERENCE FIRST to elect WOMEN OR MORE RESISTANCE WITH REGARD to go the one in HOUSTON , WHICH HAD TEN THOUSAND WOMEN .
WE had adopted an agenda at A STATE CONFERENCE at U of K .
THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT was FOUR OF THEM things .
Has anybody told any of this yet ?
WE adopted THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT .
So WE had THOSE FOUR THINGS and WE had YELLOW T-SHIRTS MADE .
MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY wish SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY still had mine .
Down the front of YELLOW T-SHIRTS MADE , overimposed on a map on LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , WE had THE THINGS .
THOSE PEOPLE said , `` MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , how did YOU get A REALLY GOOD QUESTION ? '' A REALLY GOOD QUESTION was A REALLY GOOD QUESTION .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , A REALLY GOOD QUESTION 's A REALLY GOOD QUESTION .
But WE were able to get support for choice , for THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT , for THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT , and for THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT .
So WE get to HOUSTON , WHICH HAD TEN THOUSAND WOMEN and YOU 're going to laugh at SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , but one of the things MOST I REMEMBER ABOUT HOUSTON , WHICH HAD TEN THOUSAND WOMEN descend on MOST I REMEMBER ABOUT HOUSTON , WHICH HAD TEN THOUSAND WOMEN and the hotels were really not prepared , was that the second day WE were there , YOU could n't find a tampon within THOSE TWO miles of the hotel .
TEN THOUSAND WOMEN had sold out of boxes of tampax .
So when YOU figure that IT ONE-FOURTH are going to be menstruating at THE SAME TIME during this conference-is IT ONE-FOURTH or a third ?
SARAH THUESEN would say one-fourth .
Yeah , okay .
So IT ONE-FOURTH was hilarious .
WE could n't find tampons .
THE OTHER THING WE COULD N'T - WE had to liberate THE MEN 'S bathrooms constantly because there was n't enough women 's bathrooms .
THE OTHER THING WE COULD N'T was highly charged .
THE OTHER THING WE COULD N'T opened with a march led by BETTY FRIEDAN AND BELLA ABZUG and one of our local judges .
BETTY FRIEDAN AND BELLA ABZUG had a mini-marathon and somebody carried a torch in .
This huge hall , it was very heavily charged , because there was an enormous anti-ERA , anti-choice , anti-gay 's rights bias there .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY honestly did n't think WE were going to get what WE wanted ; SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just did n't think WE were .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'll be damned if WE did n't get every one of those things passed .
A resolution in support of WE ?
MMM hmm , MMM is amazing in 1977 .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , MMM was just totally amazing , because there 's so many bible-belt states in THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY .
THE OTHER THING THAT I REMEMBER REALLY WELL ABOUT HOUSTON is that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had bought a pair of MY JEANS that were way too tight for SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and WE were all living out of vending machines because MY JEANS were n't set up to handle WE .
Within A DAY or THOSE TWO , A DAY OR TWO , A DAY was just agony , A DAY was agony .
But A DAY was really fun .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was so glad .
Now ANNE BRADEN 'S did go to A DAY , ANNE BRADEN 'S went to A DAY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think ANNE BRADEN 'S went as a reporter .
Do THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA think the different perspective THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA and ANNE BRADEN 'S had on A PRIORITY , like THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA were saying , A PRIORITY 's not that ANNE BRADEN 'S was so much opposed , A PRIORITY just was n't A PRIORITY , do THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA think A PRIORITY 's because THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA were a little THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA or how would THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA explain A PRIORITY ?
THE GIRLS ' GAMES , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think A PRIORITY 's because ANNE BRADEN 'S was SOUTHERN-BORN and because ANNE BRADEN 'S lived with CARL and CARL was REALLY FIERY WORKING-CLASS COMMUNIST , REALLY FIERY WORKING-CLASS COMMUNIST and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SOUTHERN-BORN had enormous influence on ANNE BRADEN 'S .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think SOUTHERN-BORN would have thought that WOMEN 'S ISSUES were paramount .
SOUTHERN-BORN would have thought that economic issues were paramount and that CIVIL RIGHTS .
A PRIORITY 's not that ANNE BRADEN 'S did n't support A PRIORITY .
A PRIORITY 's just where ANNE BRADEN 'S put the majority of ANNE BRADEN 'S energy .
ANNE BRADEN 'S did talk to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY one day and WE said WE would try to start a chapter of Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom , which is a wonderful , wonderful organization .
There 's never been ONE here .
But like everything else , WE just both got so busy and ANNE BRADEN 'S would have had to be the leader and ANNE BRADEN 'S just was n't doing ONE .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think AGE THIRTY ON -RSB- was AGE THIRTY ON -RSB- , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY really do n't .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think AGE THIRTY ON -RSB- was coming from THE SOUTH , knowing that ANNE BRADEN 'S had lived totally blind to racial injustice until ANNE BRADEN 'S was older , although MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS knows SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY lived pretty blind to AGE THIRTY ON -RSB- too .
SARAH THUESEN was going to ask , do THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA see THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA - .
SARAH THUESEN mean , THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA grew up in THE LOUISVILLE , right , so THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA were both Southerners ?
Yeah , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know .
SHE was DEEP SOUTH .
SHE was DEEP SOUTH .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY gave lip service to racial justice even in high school .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY went to an all-white girls ' public high school and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY yearbook said that in twenty-five years , SUZY KLING will be collecting funds for the Urban League in the Fiji Islands .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had NO IDEA that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was proselytizing in high school , but SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY guess SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was .
THE OTHER THING THAT I REMEMBER REALLY WELL ABOUT HOUSTON is that the races in THE LOUISVILLE and probably all through THE SOUTH were so efficiently segregated that THE LOUISVILLE really would take something monumental to remove the blinders that we wore .
Just because life went on smoothly and why when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY went away to school THE FIRST YEAR , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY joined THE NAACP , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have NO IDEA .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , THE FIRST YEAR was in 1953 and THE FIRST YEAR was n't on the top of the national agenda .
So something in SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY - .
THEIR PARENTS believed in racial justice without even using the language .
THEIR PARENTS just let SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY know that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY should n't use WORDS , that the n-word was really bad and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't talk like WORDS .
THEIR PARENTS were good in general .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was born in ' 33 , so during the Depression , men used to come to our back porch for food and mother always fed .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'd look out THE WINDOW and she 'd say , `` Stop THE WINDOW .
Do n't stare .
HE 's having HE dinner . ''
Little things like HIS DINNER , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think , begin to accumulate as YOU grow and they 're back here in YOU mind and germinating .
Also SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY uncle was A SOCIALIST WHEN YOU MARRIED HER and a friend of Norman Thomas 's and ran for mayor on the Socialist ticket in thirty-something .
Here in THE LOUISVILLE ?
UH huh .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY always define SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY as A SOCIALIST WHEN YOU MARRIED HER .
In fact , ANNE BRADEN 'S used to say to ED whenever they 'd get into hot discussions after dinner at MY HOUSE FOR PASSOVER SERVICE , ED 'd start arguing with ANNE BRADEN 'S and complaining about SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY getting out there too far , and ANNE BRADEN 'S 'd say THE THINGS like , `` ED , YOU knew SUZY KLING was A SOCIALIST WHEN YOU MARRIED HER .
What 's A GAY AND LESBIAN PROBLEM When SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got married , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was nineteen years old .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know , but SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've always felt that A GAY AND LESBIAN PROBLEM - .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY always liked EUGENE DEBS and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY always liked what EUGENE DEBS wrote and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY always liked what EUGENE DEBS said and A GAY AND LESBIAN PROBLEM made perfectly good sense to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ran with a group of college kids who were supporting Henry Wallace when EUGENE DEBS was making EUGENE DEBS and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY used to leaflet .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was fourteen .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think THEY had an impact on SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought THEY were really hip and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY wanted to be like THEY .
Do n't ask SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY why .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was supposed to be at home worrying about Saturday night dates .
There was a part of SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY that was always very politically sensitive .
Unformed , uneducated , but politically sensitive .
By THE LATE 70S , well when THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA got back from THAT CONFERENCE IN HOUSTON , at that time in GENERAL , did THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA feel like THE WOMEN 'S movement was on the cusp of BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS or did THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA already start to sense that THE WOMEN 'S MOVEMENT , ISSUES THAT SAY IN THE EARLY 70S , YOU REALLY THOUGHT WERE GOING TO TAKE OFF AND THEN NEVER DID was declining in momentum ?
Well , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY gave THAT CONFERENCE IN HOUSTON much thought .
By THE SAME TIME SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got back from HOUSTON , WHICH HAD TEN THOUSAND WOMEN , THE LATE 70S 'd finished THE LATE 70S Title IX project here and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'd seen changes wrought by THE LATE 70S .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that THE WOMEN 'S movement in THE LOUISVILLE and in LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY has been pretty quiescent for THIRTY YEARS .
SOME PEOPLE say , `` Well , maybe that just means that YOU all got what YOU wanted , '' but SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SOME PEOPLE 's total bullshit , because WORKING-CLASS WOMEN and POOR WOMEN sure did n't get what WORKING-CLASS WOMEN wanted , ONE DAY MANY YEARS is ONE DAY MANY YEARS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , WE 're so far from that ONE DAY MANY YEARS is n't funny .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ca n't believe that WE 's come to a standstill in WASHINGTON again .
So see , here SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY go .
Besides those sort of economic justice issues , were there other big disappointments with THAT REGARD ?
What SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY guess SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY remember most about what SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought and felt back then was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought that WE settled cheap , that WE settled too soon and WE settled too cheap , that WE had not really done what WE needed to do to fulfill WE commitment to justice for WOMEN OR MORE RESISTANCE WITH REGARD and that WE sort of quit too soon as an organized entity .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think partially WE is because a disproportionate number of the women in THE WOMEN 'S movement were comfortable middle-class women .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm not sure that there was ever any really serious attempt by WE to reach out and pull in those women in greatest need , other than DISPLACED HOMEMAKERS and abuse victims ; SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that in THAT REGARD , WE did .
WE wrote grants and got resources captured for DISPLACED HOMEMAKERS so that there was a program .
WE got a spouse abuse center set up .
But WE did n't do anything about THE ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE FOR WORKING-CLASS WOMEN .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know why .
Was there much of a welfare rights impulse here ?
There was A LITTLE ONE .
There was A LITTLE ONE .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY worked with them for A YEAR or THOSE TWO .
There was a welfare rights and A TENANTS ' rights group simultaneously .
A TENANTS ' rights group was far more effective than THE WELFARE RIGHTS GROUP and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think THE WELFARE RIGHTS GROUP 's partially because A TENANTS ' rights group had a single focus .
A TENANTS ' wanted A LANDLORD-TENANT ACT and WE got A LANDLORD-TENANT ACT .
THE LOUISVILLE TENANTS ASSOCIATION YOU 'RE REFERRING TO was THE LOUISVILLE TENANTS ASSOCIATION YOU 'RE REFERRING TO ?
Right .
THE LOUISVILLE TENANTS ASSOCIATION YOU 'RE REFERRING TO was originally called the Louisville Tenants Union , but WE changed THE NAME OF IT a few years ago , because there was SOME CONCERN that WE would n't be able to get the money WE needed if WE continued to call SOME CONCERN a union .
Stupid .
But THE WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION was short-lived ?
THE WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION was , it was A COUPLE YEARS and it was short-lived because the affected class had terrible problems with life .
THEY could n't go to a meeting unless THEY had somebody to take THEY .
THEY had to get somebody to watch THEY kids .
And then YOU had THE CLASH between , if WE were supportive , WE spoke different languages .
THE CLASH 's really been hard , THE CLASH 's hard .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think economic chasms are hard to bridge .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY always felt that THE METROPOLITAN HOUSING COALITION suffered by not having LOW-INCOME PEOPLE , WHO ARE VERY OFTEN WORKING TWO JOBS AND STILL BARELY GETTING BY on THE METROPOLITAN HOUSING COALITION board , because THE FIRST CIVILIAN POLICE REVIEW BOARD 's WE talking about LOW-INCOME PEOPLE , WHO ARE VERY OFTEN WORKING TWO JOBS AND STILL BARELY GETTING BY and doing BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS .
But THE REALITY is THE REALITY 's just harder than hell to get LOW-INCOME PEOPLE , WHO ARE VERY OFTEN WORKING TWO JOBS AND STILL BARELY GETTING BY , to have any energy left to participate in something like THIS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY sort of think that anything that 's going to come is going to have to be indigenous to THE GROUP , THAT THE GROUP 'S GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE BIRTH TO IT .
There 's a welfare rights group that YOU may be familiar with in Philadelphia that 's been very successful .
Is THIS part of ACORN ?
Yeah , well , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think THIS joined ACORN , but THIS stood alone for awhile .
THIS started THIS .
There might have been a couple social workers who were there as advisors .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ca n't remember THE NAME OF IT .
But SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just do n't think middle-class people can really speak for or organize THOSE PEOPLE at another level .
In A WAY , A WAY 's pretty arrogant to think that we can do A WAY .
On THERE 'S REAL CONCERN , THERE 'S REAL CONCERN really makes SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY uncomfortable that nobody 's doing THERE 'S REAL CONCERN .
There 's SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE EQUATION .
Since THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA brought SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE EQUATION up , SARAH THUESEN want to talk about THE METROPOLITAN HOUSING COALITION .
When SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE EQUATION was founded in '89 or ' 88 -
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think A FEW PEOPLE FIRST started to meet in ' 88 .
A FEW PEOPLE were mainly A FEW PEOPLE and then A FEW PEOPLE got a few more people in as the homeless situation exploded here .
THEN IN ' 89 , THEN IN ' 89 applied for a 501c3 and wrote a grant to the Bingham Foundation for a million dollars for seed money for staff .
When SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY walked off THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT , walked off the job of THE NATIONAL ACLU , how old was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ? SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was fifty-seven years old , no visible means of support .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY felt great for about two weeks and then SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started waking up in a cold sweat .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY envisioned SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY applying for A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE and then SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought , `` No , THEN IN ' 89 get shot .
YOU do n't want to do A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE . ''
MHC at about A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE JEWISH INTELLECTUALS got A HUNDRED THOU FROM BINGHAM , NOT A MILLION , but a hundred thousand to be used over three years to provide for staffing .
A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAD BEEN MEETING WITH THEM came over and A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAD BEEN MEETING WITH THEM said , `` SUZY KLING , YOU need to apply for A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE .
MINE WHO HAD BEEN MEETING WITH THEM 's going to be great . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` BLANCHE , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know anything about housing . ''
BLANCHE said , `` Yeah , but YOU 're the best organizer in A REALLY GOOD QUESTION . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` BLANCHE , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know anything about housing . ''
A REALLY GOOD QUESTION just really did n't grab SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
BLANCHE said , `` Come on , apply . ''
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did apply .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got A CALL .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had an interview with FIVE or SIX of these lovely people , a couple of whom SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY knew .
THEY wanted someone to work on contract so that THEY would n't have to pay HEALTH INSURANCE .
THEY wanted somebody who would work for twenty-five thousand dollars A YEAR on contract .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY talked to THEY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` YOU know , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've started a lot of COALITIONS and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think COALITIONS can be really effective .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think YOU 're going to find somebody who can do A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE 's just not SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
But thanks for THE SAME TIME and lots of luck . ''
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY came home and about TWO HOURS later , THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD calls SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY up .
THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD said , `` SUZY KLING , what would TWO HOURS take to get YOU ? '' SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had n't even really thought about TWO HOURS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` TWO HOURS would take twenty-five thousand dollars A YEAR .
YOU pay SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY taxes .
YOU pay HEALTH INSURANCE .
And AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ATTACHED agrees to meet with SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY once a week and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't mean for THREE MONTHS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean AD INFINITUM , because SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know a damn thing about housing . ''
AD INFINITUM said , `` Okay . ''
So for TWO YEARS , WE met at a local cafeteria at seven-thirty on Wednesday mornings until about NINE , for two years until WE got a new president and AD INFINITUM , BECAUSE I DO N'T KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT HOUSING did n't want to be bothered getting up that early .
TWO YEARS was TWO YEARS , because THEY were getting A LOT out of A LOT , THEY really were .
Who all was represented on AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ATTACHED just in SORT OF GENERAL TERMS ? Were THEY MAINLY PEOPLE WHO WORKED DIRECTLY IN HOUSING ?
Yeah , MAINLY PEOPLE WHO WORKED DIRECTLY IN HOUSING worked directly in housing , with the exception of the community ministry people who were providing social services to MAINLY PEOPLE WHO WORKED DIRECTLY IN HOUSING service area .
PLUS the executive director of Legal Aid .
PLUS was DENNIS BRICKING .
DENNIS BRICKING , uh huh .
For awhile-well SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY guess not .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started to say for AWHILE THE DIRECTOR OF THE KENTUCKY COMMISSION on HUMAN RIGHTS , IN WHICH HOUSING SEGREGATION IS A NO-NO ; THE LOUISVILLE , but no , AWHILE THE DIRECTOR OF THE KENTUCKY COMMISSION did n't come .
THE KENTUCKY COMMISSION was a pretty motley crew .
THE CITY 'S CDBG DIRECTOR , who was BLANCHE , BLANCHE was THE CITY 'S CDBG DIRECTOR .
BLANCHE and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ran the Impeach Nixon campaign together and a couple of really great antiwar demonstrations .
WE had AN ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATION THAT HAD FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AFTER THE CAMBODIAN BOMBINGS , WHICH YOU 'RE PROBABLY TOO YOUNG TO EVEN REMEMBER , but it was pretty terrifying to WE that WE would go bomb THE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL PEOPLE .
AN ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATION THAT HAD FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AFTER THE CAMBODIAN BOMBINGS , WHICH YOU 'RE PROBABLY TOO YOUNG TO EVEN REMEMBER looks like child 's play today compared to what WE 're doing .
AN ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATION THAT HAD FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AFTER THE CAMBODIAN BOMBINGS , WHICH YOU 'RE PROBABLY TOO YOUNG TO EVEN REMEMBER was AN ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATION THAT HAD FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AFTER THE CAMBODIAN BOMBINGS , WHICH YOU 'RE PROBABLY TOO YOUNG TO EVEN REMEMBER .
FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE were straight .
FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE were committed .
THE HOUSING PEOPLE were profoundly THE HOUSING PEOPLE .
A LOT OF THE HOUSING PEOPLE saw housing as a basic human right and THE HOUSING PEOPLE saw housing as a way for LOW-INCOME PEOPLE , WHO ARE VERY OFTEN WORKING TWO JOBS AND STILL BARELY GETTING BY to accumulate wealth .
When SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY used to hear that , A LOT OF THE HOUSING PEOPLE set SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY teeth on edge , but over TWO YEARS , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've come to realize how important TWO YEARS is in terms of having something .
Building equity .
Building equity in YOU home is accumulating wealth and without THE HOME OF SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , YOU know - .
What was the general impulse behind starting THE METROPOLITAN HOUSING COALITION ?
Ronald Reagan and the cutback in housing staff and the homeless , who were becoming more and more visible on ours ' and other streets .
Was there discussion in any of the initial meetings about HOUSING INTEGRATION AS A CONCERN ?
THE GIRLS ' GAMES , THE GIRLS ' GAMES was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , THE ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE FOR WORKING-CLASS WOMEN was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY issue .
At A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE JEWISH INTELLECTUALS or ABOUT EARLIER or both ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know ABOUT EARLIER , but what followed SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY into A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE was economic and racial equity .
So one of the FIRST things SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY worked A YEAR before SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did A YEAR , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY created a Fair Housing Coalition and A YEAR is still meeting , not as vigorously as A YEAR had when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was THE CITY 'S CDBG DIRECTOR .
What SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY invited all the organizational members of MHC that had A FAIR HOUSING BIAS OF SOME KIND , whether A FAIR HOUSING BIAS OF SOME KIND was the Tenants Association ; THE BANKS , which are required under THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT to loan equally ; the Community Action Agency , which was dealing with poor people ; the Kentucky Commission on HUMAN RIGHTS , IN WHICH HOUSING SEGREGATION IS A NO-NO ; THE LOUISVILLE and JEFFERSON COUNTY HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION .
There were about ten or ELEVEN YEARS groups and we met once A MONTH .
THE PURPOSE OF ME , WHY I DID THIS WAS I thought that THE PURPOSE OF ME , WHY I DID THIS WAS I would beneficial for these groups to keep each other posted on what was new in the field , because THIS were all understaffed and THIS could n't know everything there was to know .
THE PURPOSE OF ME , WHY I DID THIS WAS I was THE PURPOSE OF ME , WHY I DID THIS WAS I .
Number THOSE TWO , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought it would be emotionally beneficial for THIS to get together with THIS PEERs , because burnout is so high in so many of TWO JOBS .
Thirdly , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY thought that it would be beneficial for THOSE TWO to plan a community program every April , which is Fair Housing Month .
THIS 've been meeting for FIFTEEN YEARS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , A CHARTER MEMBER ebbs and flows and FIFTEEN YEARS 's not THE SAME PEOPLE FROM EVERY AGENCY , but FIFTEEN YEARS has created a presence .
Among the folks involved with SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , what 's the general consensus with regard to how much progress THE SAME PEOPLE FROM EVERY AGENCY 've made since the open housing movement in TERMS OF HOUSING INTEGRATION ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that there 's generally a consensus that progress has been made .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that there is a general consensus that SOME OF THE BIG PROBLEMS , THE PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN , involve predatory lending is a big one .
Foreclosures is A HUGE PROBLEM .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY guess THOSE TWO are sort of on the top of the agenda in TERMS OF HOUSING INTEGRATION : can anybody move where SOME OF THE BIG PROBLEMS , THE PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN want to move , where SOME OF THE BIG PROBLEMS , THE PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN can afford to move ? SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that there 's A FEELING that TERMS OF HOUSING INTEGRATION 's pretty much okay , but on THERE 'S REAL CONCERN , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY certainly echo A FEELING , THESE HOPE VI PROGRAMS are just resegregating THOSE PEOPLE .
SARAH THUESEN was going to ask THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA about SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
THE LOUISVILLE had a couple big Hope VI projects .
What do THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA think ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SARAH THUESEN should n't be considered housing programs .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SARAH THUESEN should be considered neighborhood revitalization programs .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm very concerned and have been since WE got the first one six , seven years ago .
Was that the -
Park DuValle .
Very concerned that WE have n't A CLUE AS TO WHERE ALL THOSE PEOPLE WENT and not only that , but that A CLUE AS TO WHERE ALL THOSE PEOPLE WENT looks good down there , but there 's no damned amenities to speak of .
As A REAL NEIGHBORHOOD , A REAL NEIGHBORHOOD 's not .
A REAL NEIGHBORHOOD 's one concern .
The SECOND concern is where did THOSE PEOPLE go , because the previous director of housing kept everything very tight , so SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm not sure where THOSE PEOPLE went .
This Hope VI program down at Liberty Green SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think is going to run into SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS , although THE NEW HOUSING DIRECTOR is much more open than the previous one and THE NEW HOUSING DIRECTOR also got really burnt one time on the airport expansion program and SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS does n't want to get burnt again .
YOU can work with SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS .
SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS is committed to one-for-one replacement , so any public housing unit that goes down , SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS 's committed to finding ANOTHER one somewhere in THE COMMUNITY .
Now that raises THOSE QUESTIONS 's probably because SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY go looking for trouble .
When YOU do something like THESE HOPE VI PROGRAMS , WE 're not doing anything , WE as A COMMUNITY are n't doing anything to measure what happens with the disruption of the social capital in A NEIGHBORHOOD .
What happens when ANNE BRADEN 'S is n't right next door to lend SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY a dollar if SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY need THAT MONEY ? What happens if JOHNNY gets JOHNNY hand stuck in THE DOOR and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got THREE other kids and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got to get JOHNNY down to THE HOSPITAL and there 's nobody , none of the neighbors around that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY can ask ? WE 're not even asking THOSE QUESTIONS .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that social capital makes A NEIGHBORHOOD as much as THE BUILDINGS .
How do THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA achieve HOUSING INTEGRATION AS A CONCERN while also keeping some of these communities that already exist in place and vibrant ?
HONEY , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY wish SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY knew the answer to HONEY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would be the national housing guru .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know how YOU do HONEY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know if anybody knows .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know if Nick Retsinas knows .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know if Chester Hartman knows .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know if Gary Orfield knows .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just do n't know .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know how YOU do THAT .
THAT 's hard .
-LSB- A CRUCIAL QUESTION -RSB- -LSB- RECORDER is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
THE GIRLS ' GAMES , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think A CRUCIAL QUESTION 's A CRUCIAL QUESTION that we just have n't got THE CAPACITY TO DO HIGHER MATH to answer as a society .
THE MHC , THE MHC main goal was to SORT OF GENERAL TERMS stimulate dialogue on THESE ISSUES AND POINT POLICY MAKERS in fruitful directions .
Was THE MHC also trying to partner with financial agencies and banks to try to develop certain neighborhoods ?
THE GIRLS ' GAMES .
THE MHC interest in THE BANKS has been one , getting money out of THESE ISSUES AND POINT POLICY MAKERS for us , and THOSE TWO was to see that THESE ISSUES AND POINT POLICY MAKERS were doing was THESE ISSUES AND POINT POLICY MAKERS 're supposed to do in terms of THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think the last THOSE TWO directors have been really interested in THOSE TWO , because THOSE TWO 's very potentially explosive .
So THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA think there 's more disregard for some of the fair housing legislation from the 60s than is being openly acknowledged ?
By THE BANKS , YOU mean ?
Yeah .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think THE BANKS have been taken by THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT kicking and screaming to invest in low-income communities .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think THEY want to do THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , occasionally YOU 'll find an enlightened banker who knows that THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT 's good business , but MOST OF THEM , MOST OF THEM 's just another goddamn regulation that the feds are cramming down OUR throats .
OUR get , or OUR used to get and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY guess OUR still get , the reports from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was on THEY board for awhile , as to who 's doing YOUR GENERAL SENSE OF WHERE THINGS WERE HEADED to OUR and OUR 'd gotten some bad reports on a couple of OUR member banks .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , in a moment of great foolishness unmatched by any other except the foolishness SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY felt one time for a man , started to file a complaint with-I forget which of the three agencies this was written to .
There 's THREE different -
Oversight .
UH huh .
OCC .
Is n't is THIS THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING RAISED WITH NO FATHERS BECAUSE WE LOCK THEM UP FOR PRACTICALLY NOTHING ? alike ?
THEY do blend together .
Oh , MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
Anyway , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was on the verge of doing THEY and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got called off .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't even know WHAT THE PERFORMANCE - .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that WHAT THE PERFORMANCE 're doing minimally what WHAT THE PERFORMANCE have to do , which is to lend to LOW-INCOME PEOPLE , WHO ARE VERY OFTEN WORKING TWO JOBS AND STILL BARELY GETTING BY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , if WHAT THE PERFORMANCE 're taking money out of A LOWINCOME COMMUNITY , WHAT THE PERFORMANCE got to be putting A LOWINCOME COMMUNITY back ; A LOWINCOME COMMUNITY 's A LOWINCOME COMMUNITY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SOME OF THEM are doing a fairly good job .
But A HUGE PROBLEM is , YOU see , WE 've only got THOSE TWO or THREE locally-owned banks here anymore .
SOME OF THEM 're all taken over and the farther away SOME OF THEM get from WE , the less emotionally involved SOME OF THEM are in doing right by WE .
THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA retired from THE MHC POSITION in 2000 -
THE MHC POSITION 's very murky .
Let THE MHC POSITION see .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had this surgery six years ago .
So in 2000 after SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY lung taken out , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY realized that 2000 was going to be virtually impossible to work FULL-TIME .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY began to sort of ease out and one of my board members and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY plotted SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY replacement , which turned out to be a very bad idea .
FULL-TIME was there , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think , not even quite TWO YEARS and FULL-TIME got pregnant again .
If SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had n't had LUNG CANCER , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would be working full-time still .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY loved LUNG CANCER .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY love that group .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had the longest honeymoon SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ever had in SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY life with THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY realized after SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'd been there A COUPLE YEARS that THE HOUSING PEOPLE have THEIR HEADS and THE HOUSING PEOPLE hearts in the same place .
CIVIL LIBERTARIANS are only THEIR HEADS .
CIVIL LIBERTARIANS do n't have A HEART .
What do THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA mean by CIVIL LIBERTARIANS exactly ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean A HEART 's all an intellectual exercise .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had a terrible , terrible experience while SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was working for THE NATIONAL ACLU twenty years ago .
Not ONE person on THE JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH WAS THEIR REGULAR MEETING NIGHT came to THE HOSPITAL .
Nobody sent flowers .
Nobody brought food over afterwards .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , ONE 's just all in THE HEAD OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CLINIC .
THOSE PEOPLE 're THOSE PEOPLE , but - .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did n't realize any of THOSE PEOPLE until SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY started working for THOSE PEOPLE .
Had SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY both .
And had heart , just had heart , had EMPATHY , COMPASSION , had no trouble saying , `` SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY love YOU . ''
EMPATHY , COMPASSION just makes a work environment so different .
So SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY probably would have stayed in EMPATHY , COMPASSION .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY told THEM , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'd stay in A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE until YOU all send somebody to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY or until YOU get together and say , ` What are we going to do about SUZY KLING ? '' ' -LSB- Laughter -RSB- Because SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY really loved A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE , but A JOB AT A CONVENIENCE STORE just was n't possible .
SARAH THUESEN know THEM 're getting kind of close on THE SAME TIME , so SARAH THUESEN wanted to ask just a few kind of general wrap-up questions .
Looking back on THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA whole career of activism , were there any civil rights changes broadly defined that THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA had really expected to see by THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN that THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA have n't ?
Yeah , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know expected .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY hoped to see some kind of public policy requiring HEALTH CARE for everybody , access to HEALTH CARE .
Now SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm not talking to Medicaid and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm not talking about Medicare .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm talking about equal access to good health care .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had hoped that WE would be closer to SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ideal in terms of economic justice , that THOSE PEOPLE got what THOSE PEOPLE needed to live on .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY always loved EUGENE DEBS according to FROM EACH ability , to each according to HIS NEEDS . ' SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY really hoped that at some point , WE could at least start a dialogue like HIS NEEDS .
And instead , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm seeing A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY .
A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY 's just , A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY 's really ugly what 's happened in A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY , THIS AMASSING OF INCREDIBLE WEALTH and the rape of ORDINARY PEOPLE WHEN MOTIVATED and the rape of the land .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just sort of ca n't believe A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY 's what 's happening has been allowed to happen .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY keep thinking , `` Where are YOU , MICHAEL HARRINGTON , now that we need YOU ? '' A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY 's not like everything that THIS AMASSING OF INCREDIBLE WEALTH recommended got done , but Johnson sure paid some attention to A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY and so did Bobby Kennedy .
Who 's LOOKING NOW ? So yeah , LOOKING NOW ? 's pretty grim .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY used to love A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't love A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY anymore .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm ashamed of A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY .
A COUNTRY THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF AN OLIGARCHY 's sort of sad .
Are there any issues that have progressed more quickly than THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA imagined when THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA FIRST became an activist ?
THIS is such a silly , simple answer .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think THE FACT that half of all law schools are now female and half of all medical schools are all female , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean the classes , ah , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean so fast , because we 're so smart as soon as THIS get the roadblocks out of THE WAY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just think THE FACT 's fantastic .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY wish that THAT MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS had progressed that same degree in terms of the proportionality in ITS FEMALE POPULATION .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't know what the figures are .
ONE DAY MANY YEARS ago when SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was at THE HUMAN RELATIONS SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , and maybe YOU can find THIS , put out a report called `` Social Indicators of Equality in Minorities and Females , '' and distributed ONE DAY MANY YEARS and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY used ONE DAY MANY YEARS widely in community organizing , because ONE DAY MANY YEARS had some really damning data in ONE DAY MANY YEARS .
THIS was in THE 70S .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would love to see something like THAT DONE AGAIN AND DISTRIBUTED .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY suspect that THAT DONE AGAIN AND DISTRIBUTED 's not being done , because THAT DONE AGAIN AND DISTRIBUTED would be so damning .
So yeah , there are a few things that have happened that amaze SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and there a few things that have n't happened that amaze SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think job opportunities for BLACK WOMEN is pretty discouraging .
Oh , and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think that THE PRISON POPULATION PROBLEM , MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , gee , how THIS THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING RAISED WITH NO FATHERS BECAUSE WE LOCK THEM UP FOR PRACTICALLY NOTHING ? is THIS THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING RAISED WITH NO FATHERS BECAUSE WE LOCK THEM UP FOR PRACTICALLY NOTHING ? SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY really do blame PRACTICALLY NOTHING largely on the drug war and the outrageous sentencing .
THE PRISON POPULATION PROBLEM all got started with Rockefeller .
And so expensive .
If only all THAT MONEY could go into THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
Oh , MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS and housing , medical care .
SARAH THUESEN imagine THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA talk with THREE OTHER KIDS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE about THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA work or have over TWO YEARS , or maybe not .
SARAH THUESEN 're kind of bored with A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE .
Really ?
What would THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA most like for THREE OTHER KIDS or future generations in GENERAL to remember about YOUR EARLIER ACTIVISM ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'd like THREE OTHER KIDS to remember that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was an ordinary person and that ORDINARY PEOPLE WHEN MOTIVATED can do really extraordinary things , because SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was and am very ordinary .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY did n't learn how to do this in school .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY goofed up along THE WAY .
Nobody taught SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
THE WAY was something that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY taught SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY to organize , because SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY love and like THOSE PEOPLE .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do think that there are A LOT OF PEOPLE out THERE 'S , and THOSE PEOPLE told SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY so , THOSE PEOPLE would tell SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY that THOSE PEOPLE would love to do what SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've done with MY WORK .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would say , `` Well , do A LOT OF PEOPLE . ''
THOSE PEOPLE 'd say , `` SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY ca n't afford to '' or `` SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would n't know HOW . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think anybody could do HOW .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , YOU have to have A RAGE THRESHOLD that 's fairly low , but if YOU 've got A RAGE THRESHOLD .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY hear THOSE PEOPLE think , `` Oh SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY God , SHE 's the most amazing creature .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY mean , SHE 's just unbelievable and SHE 's THIS . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm not .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm just another ordinary person who got really pissed and on many occasions decided to do something about THIS .
Does that make sense ?
Yeah .
Were there any things THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA had wanted to bring up or talk about that SARAH THUESEN have n't asked THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY feel like SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've talked for THREE MONTHS to YOU , SARAH THUESEN .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think if SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY were YOU , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would want to know where SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've gotten MY SUPPORT .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have gotten MY SUPPORT from an incredible network of WHITE WOMEN , different kinds of WHITE WOMEN who love SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and who have been there for SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and who SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think are absolutely essential to anyone who 's involved in working as an organizer , activist , or entrepreneur , whatever YOU want to call SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY just do n't think YOU can do MY WORK without MY WORK .
Has that been A CONSTANT FACTOR THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER or is A CONSTANT FACTOR THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER more so since THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA husband died ?
THE GIRLS ' GAMES , A CONSTANT FACTOR THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER 's been pretty constant , because MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME was n't particularly supportive for some of THOSE YEARS WHERE YOU FELT LIKE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS OVER .
But of course , for many years MY HUSBAND , WHO WAS A NICE MAN , BUT HE WAS N'T WHERE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME was .
But SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think just in doing the work SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've done , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've met SUCH WONDERFUL WOMEN that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would n't have met if SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY had n't been doing MY WORK .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have developed relationships with SUCH WONDERFUL WOMEN that have really stood SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY in good stead .
SUCH WONDERFUL WOMEN 're SUCH WONDERFUL WOMEN , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've just written something to read at ANNE BRADEN 'S memorial service .
Can SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY email ANNE BRADEN 'S MEMORIAL SERVICE .
ANNE BRADEN 'S 's totally no bullshit .
And SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , leave SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY something , Jan. ''
ANNE BRADEN 'S said , `` YOU do n't have more than twelve minutes . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` Nobody told SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY that . ''
YOU were n't there , were YOU ?
When SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY was finished and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got off EIGHTEEN MINUTES and SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm walking down the aisle right past ANNE BRADEN 'S , ANNE BRADEN 'S says , `` EIGHTEEN MINUTES was EIGHTEEN MINUTES . ''
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY said , `` But there was JAN , JAN , in between .
YOU have to make accommodation for A PAUSE , JAN . ''
So PEOPLE LIKE THAT WHO HAVE AN EXPERTISE WHO CAN HELP ME , PEOPLE WHO DO N'T , PEOPLE WHO KNOW SOMEBODY , I MEAN EVERY WOMAN I KNOW is an amazing resource person for something or other .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would have done as well , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY know SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY would n't have done as well as SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have without PEOPLE LIKE THAT WHO HAVE AN EXPERTISE WHO CAN HELP ME , PEOPLE WHO DO N'T , PEOPLE WHO KNOW SOMEBODY , I MEAN EVERY WOMAN I KNOW , not to mention how enriching of THE RICHEST LIFE THE RICHEST LIFE is .
THE RICHEST LIFE 's just THE RICHEST LIFE .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY think SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm ONE OF THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE I KNOW .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have been able to do work that SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY have really cared passionately about .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've done ONE OF THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE I KNOW largely with people SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY care passionately about .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've had A LOT OF FUN IN DOING IT .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY got great kids .
A LOT OF FUN IN DOING IT 's been fabulous .
A LOT OF FUN IN DOING IT 's just been fabulous .
Now there 's a JEWISH superstition that says YOU must n't say THE THINGS like JEWISH , because MY GOD , THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS will punish YOU .
Well , maybe THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA should end on a negative note then .
Yeah , SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY shirt is really dirty .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 'm going to have to clean the whole outfit .
Would THE FOUNDER OF KENTUCKY 'S PRO-ERA like THE CLOSING WORDS to be THE CLOSING WORDS ?
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY do n't think so , no .
SUZY POST IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY 've enjoyed talking to YOU .
Likewise .
Thanks so much for taking -
A PLEASURE 's been A PLEASURE .
