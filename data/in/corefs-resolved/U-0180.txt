SARAH THUESEN name is SARAH THUESEN and this is an interview with ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW .
THE TWENTY-THIRD OF JUNE 's THE TWENTY-THIRD OF JUNE .
SARAH THUESEN 'm conducting this interview for OUR LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT , OUR LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT project .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW , SARAH THUESEN 'd thought OUR 'd start today by just talking JUST A LITTLE BIT about YOUR background and where YOUR grew up .
SARAH THUESEN want to hear JUST A LITTLE BIT about YOUR life before YOUR got involved with THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR here in LOUISVILLE , RIGHT .
Just tell SARAH THUESEN JUST A LITTLE BIT about where YOUR came from .
YOUR were born in KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING , but not in LOUISVILLE , RIGHT ?
Right , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was born in PADUCAH , Kentucky .
PADUCAH , KENTUCKY 's PADUCAH , KENTUCKY .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW grew up in METROPOLIS , ILLINOIS , which is right across the river from PADUCAH and PADUCAH 's where ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mom still lives .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went to high school in METROPOLIS , ILLINOIS and then went away to college at THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS and became involved in LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and then spent ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW junior year abroad in GHANA , in west AFRICA .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW came back at A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION when THE NATION was exploding with civil rights activity and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was very moved by A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went south to work in LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
Just going back for a minute to growing up in ILLINOIS , what did YOUR parents do ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mom 's a schoolteacher and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW dad had a small furniture business .
Did YOUR know anyone growing up who was a member of A UNION ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess some of ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW friends ' mothers may have been THEIR MEMBERS , there was A GLOVE FACTORY there and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that A GLOVE FACTORY was unionized .
But ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW really was n't familiar with unionism from YOUR BACKGROUND .
So YOUR were saying YOUR went to college at THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS .
Is that where YOUR FIRST got involved in CIVIL RIGHTS activity or was FIRST after college ?
Yeah , well ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did .
Although actually , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think FIRST was still when ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was still in high school or just barely out that ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW minister at the Presbyterian Church gave ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW THE NORMAL SERIES OF THINGS Between .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW read that .
FIRST was FIRST that ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW read about CIVIL RIGHTS and it was very moving .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess it was ANNE THAT GOT ME INVOLVED AND MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY .
DID YOU AT THAT TIME , EVEN AT THAT YOUNG AGE , imagine going south then to work on THE MOVEMENT , WHO JUST REALLY DESTROYED IT , DESTROYED THE MOVEMENT ?
Well not right then .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think DID YOU AT THAT TIME , EVEN AT THAT YOUNG AGE was probably DID YOU AT THAT TIME , EVEN AT THAT YOUNG AGE .
DID YOU AT THAT TIME , EVEN AT THAT YOUNG AGE was really early .
But it was in MY MIND , so that as THE THINGS unfolded , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW became involved .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW joined the NAACP at THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS and we sent a delegation to THE SOUTH during break to picket with PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS were looking for A WAY to get involved , because A WAY was like the moral conscience of THE NATION .
A SOUTHERNER had to do something and so PATIENT CARE LEADERS did what PATIENT CARE LEADERS could .
How many other white students were a member of the NAACP at THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS ?
Oh there were quite a few , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think .
None in ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW dormitory .
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was the only one there , but there were THE OTHERS .
Was -LSB- LAUGHTER immediately after college that YOUR went into , did YOUR say the Peace Corps ?
'98 MAYBE , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went on the junior year ABROAD PROGRAM and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went to school in GHANA .
And what was that EXPERIENCE LIKE ?
Well , EXPERIENCE LIKE was amazing .
UNBEKNOWNST TO ME , UNBEKNOWNST TO ME was UNBEKNOWNST TO ME .
And GHANA AT THAT TIME was GHANA AT THAT TIME , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think , FIRST country to become independent in the modern era and had a progressive who was KWAME NKRUMAH .
There was a seven-year plan for development and KWAME NKRUMAH spoke of African socialism and KWAME NKRUMAH was KWAME NKRUMAH .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did n't even know who KWAME NKRUMAH was .
And DR. W.E.B. DUBOIS was at THE UNIVERSITY WORKING ON HIS AFRICAN ENCYCLOPEDIA .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went to a ceremony with DR. W.E.B. DUBOIS and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW African friends had to tell ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW who DR. W.E.B. DUBOIS was and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW should know because DR. W.E.B. DUBOIS 's DR. W.E.B. DUBOIS .
CONOR CRUISE O'BRIEN , who wrote To KATANGA and Back , was CONOR CRUISE O'BRIEN .
So KATANGA was KATANGA and so ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW learned A LOT .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did n't have any understanding of international affairs or what was going on in THE WORLD .
Of course , there were a lot of PATIENT CARE LEADERS who were very much into THE WORLD .
One of my friends there was A SOUTH AFRICAN WHO WAS ACTIVE IN THE ANC and SHE 's currently the ambassador of the South African government to THE COUNTRY , I THINK , THAT EVER GOT THE BOARD TO GO FOR AN INJUNCTION ON THAT BASIS OF THE RESTRUCTURING .
Who is that ?
SHE name 's Barbara Masekela .
HER NAME 'S BARBARA MASEKELA 's HER NAME 'S BARBARA MASEKELA .
So THE TWENTY-THIRD OF JUNE was THE TWENTY-THIRD OF JUNE .
And were YOUR over there for a full year ?
What year did YOUR come back to the States ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW came back in ' 63 .
As A MATTER OF FACT , a friend of mine and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW hitchhiked across AFRICA back to England .
Then ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW took A BOAT back and while we were on A BOAT is when DR. W.E.B. DUBOIS died .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW remember that .
The TWO things that happened were DuBois died and THE POOR PEOPLE 'S MARCH WHEN THAT BREAKING DOWN OF THE BARRIERS IN PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS WAS JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY .
A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF INTIMIDATION OF PEOPLE .
What was going through YOUR mind when YOUR heard reports about THE POOR PEOPLE 'S MARCH WHEN THAT BREAKING DOWN OF THE BARRIERS IN PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS WAS JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY on WASHINGTON , PENNSYLVANIA 'S A SMALLER TOWN TO THE SOUTH . ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did n't know A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IT at A LOT OF MONEY , but A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IT was exciting .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW came back in the midst of the real blossoming of LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
Had YOUR already finished college at A LOT OF MONEY or did YOUR still have another year or TWO left ?
'98 MAYBE , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW still had another year .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went back to THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS and then in the midterm , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went south and worked on projects in THE SOUTH .
What were YOUR involved in in THE SOUTH ?
And where did YOUR go in THE SOUTH with SNCC ?
Oh man .
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was in HATTIESBURG FOR SOME OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS where the police marched in these yellow rain slickers in huge-like platoons or something .
HATTIESBURG FOR SOME OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS was because there was a voter registration drive going on there .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was in HATTIESBURG FOR SOME OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS and Atlanta .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think THE PLACES were basically THE PLACES that ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went .
Then ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ended up working in HAZARD , Kentucky on A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT .
We put out A NEWSLETTER and worked on A NEWSLETTER .
How long were YOUR involved with A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT ?
For many months , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know exactly how long .
Was that allied with SCEF ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew CARL and ANNE BRADEN 'S .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW had been to HER HOME .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , we talked with CARL AND ANNE BRADEN .
But HER HOME was n't , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't think HER HOME was directly allied with CARL AND ANNE BRADEN .
HER HOME was later , THE MCSURELYS , WHEN THEY WERE THERE .
Did YOUR know THE MCSURELYS , WHEN THEY WERE THERE ?
Not THEN .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew THEN later .
THEN were there at a later time .
Were YOUR organizing MINERS WHO WERE ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THE MINES UNION ? A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT was A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT ?
Well , at A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION it was THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT , WHICH WAS AN EFFORT TO RAISE THE ISSUES OF POVERTY IN THE AREA .
And at THE SAME TIME , there had been TWO cases in which MINERS WHO WERE ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THE MINES UNION had been arrested and charged .
WE were working on defense cases , raising money for the defense in THOSE TWO CASES , and tried to organize PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
A SOUTHERNER know , WE had A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT MET EVERY SATURDAY OR SOMETHING AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT TO DO .
WE put out A NEWSLETTER .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did A NEWSLETTER .
So YOUR went directly from working with SNCC to THIS PROJECT IN KENTUCKY ?
What connections in YOUR mind did YOUR see at the time between LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and THE LABOR MOVEMENT ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean PATIENT CARE LEADERS drew PATIENT CARE LEADERS at A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS were around A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION was A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think DR. KING drew THAT CONCLUSION when DR. KING organized THE POOR PEOPLE 'S March when that breaking down of the barriers in public accommodations was just scratching the surface of inequality and injustice in THE COUNTRY , I THINK , THAT EVER GOT THE BOARD TO GO FOR AN INJUNCTION ON THAT BASIS OF THE RESTRUCTURING , and that buried deep beneath THAT CONCLUSION was economic inequality .
Therefore , ONE OF THE WAYS TO CHANGE THAT was for working PATIENT CARE LEADERS to organize and to push forward with demands that would change that situation and end the poverty .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , ONE OF THE WAYS TO CHANGE THAT 's really , poverty is the scourge of OUR country , THE COUNTRY , I THINK , THAT EVER GOT THE BOARD TO GO FOR AN INJUNCTION ON THAT BASIS OF THE RESTRUCTURING OUR believe in .
What did THE FOLKS back home in ILLINOIS think about THE FOLKS ?
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- Well , THE FOLKS were n't so pleased .
THE FOLKS were n't pleased about -LSB- LAUGHTER .
What can ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW say ?
Did that CAUSE CONFLICT within YOUR family ?
Well , yeah , CAUSE CONFLICT did .
CAUSE CONFLICT was CAUSE CONFLICT .
Of course , YOUR PARENTS care about YOUR PARENTS kids , so YOUR PARENTS were worried about the danger .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess YOUR PARENTS 's probably true of the parents of all the people that went south and worked on those projects .
Did YOUR have any thoughts of changing course and getting involved in something more conventional ?
Never once .
Really ?
So what did YOUR end up doing after YOUR work in HAZARD ?
Well , there were A GROUP OF US WHO WERE AT SOME POINT CONVINCED , the people from around SNCC and MY FUTURE HUSBAND was ONE OF THEM , that A GROUP OF US WHO WERE AT SOME POINT CONVINCED would make sense to work within THE UNION MOVEMENT , that if WE could build movement there , ONE OF THEM could take on THE ECONOMIC INJUSTICE .
A GROUP OF US WHO WERE AT SOME POINT CONVINCED was A GROUP OF US WHO WERE AT SOME POINT CONVINCED that WE could make a change .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went to work for THE UE , a number of us did , the United Electrical Workers .
And where were YOUR based ?
Well , WE went to NEW YORK SOME and then they sent ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW to GALETON , PENNSYLVANIA .
Is that pretty close to PITTSBURGH ?
'98 MAYBE , '98 MAYBE 's way up by the NEW YORK SOME line , way north where the snow was three feet deep .
Okay .
YOUR were in PITTSBURGH later , right ?
Yeah , later .
So during A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION that YOUR 're in NEW YORK SOME later in GALETON , PENNSYLVANIA , were YOUR keeping in touch with THE MOVEMENT , WHO JUST REALLY DESTROYED IT , DESTROYED THE MOVEMENT back in KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING ? Did YOUR see THE BRADENS at all ? SARAH THUESEN know THEN came to NEW YORK SOME .
Well , THE BRADENS were like EVERYWHERE .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , everybody was in touch with THE BRADENS during THAT PERIOD OF TIME .
So as A MATTER OF FACT , when MY FUTURE HUSBAND would go down to see YOUR PARENTS , SOME would usually stop there and stay at MY FUTURE HUSBAND house .
MY FUTURE HUSBAND were open doors for any traveling people who needed a bed .
MY FUTURE HUSBAND little tiny house on Virginia Avenue , THEIR LITTLE TINY HOUSE ON VIRGINIA AVENUE was open to the whole movement .
What sort of inspiration were MY FUTURE HUSBAND providing YOUR during THOSE YEARS ?
Well , WE learned A LOT from THE BRADENS .
Of course , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW learned A LOT from THE WALL .
ANNE THAT GOT ME INVOLVED AND MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY explored THE IN-DEPTH RACISM and what THE IN-DEPTH RACISM had done to WE national and what is was doing , and ANNE THAT GOT ME INVOLVED AND MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY always saw THE IN-DEPTH RACISM as the core problem .
But ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that THEIR experience with that anti-communist hysteria that sent CARL to prison and made THEIR outcasts , THEIR taught PATIENT CARE LEADERS about how terrible anti-communism was .
THEIR taught THE MOVEMENT , WHO JUST REALLY DESTROYED IT , DESTROYED THE MOVEMENT .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , THEIR 's what people in THE SOUTH felt , that anti-communism had been the basis of a MILLION wrong things and of destroying a MILLION movements and that THIS NEW MOVEMENT was n't buying THIS NEW MOVEMENT .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think CARL and ANNE THAT GOT ME INVOLVED AND MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY were the center of that kind of moral position that said , `` WE 're not going to be sidetracked by anti-communist hysteria .
WE 're going to work with THE PLACES . ''
Was THE NEW COMMUNIST MOVEMENT OF THE 70S AN INSPIRATION FOR YOU AT ALL WITH YOUR organizing ?
What 's THE NEW COMMUNIST MOVEMENT OF THE 70S AN INSPIRATION FOR YOU AT ALL WITH YOUR ? -LSB- -LSB- LAUGHTER
Well , THE NEW COMMUNIST MOVEMENT OF THE 70S AN INSPIRATION FOR YOU AT ALL WITH YOUR 's THE NEW COMMUNIST MOVEMENT OF THE 70S AN INSPIRATION FOR YOU AT ALL WITH YOUR .
SARAH THUESEN did n't know if THE NEW COMMUNIST MOVEMENT OF THE 70S AN INSPIRATION FOR YOU AT ALL WITH YOUR had been any inspiration for YOUR .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm not familiar with THE NEW COMMUNIST MOVEMENT OF THE 70S AN INSPIRATION FOR YOU AT ALL WITH YOUR .
THE NEW COMMUNIST MOVEMENT OF THE 70S AN INSPIRATION FOR YOU AT ALL WITH YOUR 's fine .
SARAH THUESEN did n't know .
Well ONE other question sort of related to ONE , SARAH THUESEN was curious about , were YOUR familiar with the split that was going on in SCEF in the mid-70s ?
'98 MAYBE , not in detail .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW just know in general that something happened that took away the SOUTHERN PATRIOT and the assets of THE ORGANIZATION and went into THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT USE THEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MOVEMENT , WHO JUST REALLY DESTROYED IT , DESTROYED THE MOVEMENT .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ca n't remember exactly who SOUTHERN PATRIOT was .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was n't down here , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW remember SOUTHERN PATRIOT .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW remember SOUTHERN PATRIOT .
Did YOUR have any conversations with Anne Braden at A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW remember talking to ANNE THAT GOT ME INVOLVED AND MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY and Carl about A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION at one point , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did n't know the detail .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION was like CRAZY FOLKS .
A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION was like an ultra-left thing and CRAZY FOLKS came into THE ORGANIZATION and then CRAZY FOLKS destroyed THE ORGANIZATION .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't remember who A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION was even , but see A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION was kind of true everywhere .
There was A CRAZINESS THAT WOULD KIND OF INVADE WHEREVER PEOPLE WERE WORKING .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know how to describe A CRAZINESS THAT WOULD KIND OF INVADE WHEREVER PEOPLE WERE WORKING .
A CRAZINESS THAT WOULD KIND OF INVADE WHEREVER PEOPLE WERE WORKING was destructive and perhaps government-initiated .
So YOUR saw THE SAME THING GOING ON AMONG CIRCLES OF ACTIVISTS IN NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA ?
Yeah .
There were MOVEMENTS THAT WERE CRAZY , THAT WERE ALMOST , A SOUTHERNER could n't have designed ACTIVISTS IN NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA better to alienate THE PUBLIC 'S because of the rhetoric and THE TALK OF VIOLENCE AND THAT KIND OF THING .
MOVEMENTS THAT WERE CRAZY , THAT WERE ALMOST was n't in the core of THE MOVEMENT , WHO JUST REALLY DESTROYED IT , DESTROYED THE MOVEMENT , but CRAZY FOLKS came around the edges of everything and were very destructive .
When did YOUR start working with 1199 ?
In 1970 .
And 1970 was after YOUR had worked for UE for a couple of THOSE YEARS ?
Yeah , then THE UE sent ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW to PITTSBURGH and they sent Walter to Detroit .
Then WE made a decision to leave THE UE and WE were involved in activities in PITTSBURGH and then ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went to work for 1199 .
WE organized A PETITION among PEOPLE AT A HOSPITAL to ask 1199 to come and PEOPLE AT A HOSPITAL did , because at A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION , 1199 was just 1199 .
PEOPLE AT A HOSPITAL did n't have a national perspective .
Was there anything in particular about organizing HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT APPEALED TO YOU ? Why did YOUR choose to go to work for 1199 ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think 1199 was 1199 as being an activist union and a cut above in terms of having a perspective .
But 1199 was also organizing AFRICAN-AMERICAN workers in JOBS , so that was important .
And 1199 was a progressive union and was making breakthroughs in THE AREA .
So 1199 's why WE contacted AFRICAN-AMERICAN WORKERS and asked AFRICAN-AMERICAN WORKERS to come to GALETON , PENNSYLVANIA to help WE and WE did A PETITION from hospital workers there .
SARAH THUESEN know WE probably do n't have A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION to go into all of your experiences during THOSE YEARS , but looking back on YOUR time in GALETON , PENNSYLVANIA , what 's YOUR proudest accomplishment from YOUR WORK IN HAZARD ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
WE did establish A UNION there , won SOME BIG HOSPITALS .
WASHINGTON HOSPITAL was , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess , WASHINGTON HOSPITAL and A CONTRACT was in ' 73 .
Was that in PITTSBURGH ?
Well , PITTSBURGH 's right outside .
WASHINGTON , PENNSYLVANIA 'S A SMALLER TOWN TO THE SOUTH .
Was that a majority AFRICAN-AMERICAN union ?
'98 MAYBE , '98 MAYBE was white , mostly white .
But '98 MAYBE was one of the things that we-you know , in GALETON , PENNSYLVANIA outside of the cities , most of FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS were white in the other areas .
And ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess '98 MAYBE was one of the breakthroughs that WE made was that 1199 was considered an AFRICAN-AMERICAN union and so there were PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
'98 MAYBE was n't true .
WE were able to break through EVERYWHERE .
WE broke through at Mercy Hospital at Wilkes Barre and organized the registered nurses and the whole hospital , actually , all the bargaining units at A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think THE FIRST HOSPITAL WE WON WAS LEWISTOWN , WHICH WAS A SMALLER HOSPITAL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STATE SOMEWHERE NEAR HARRISBURG .
THE FIRST HOSPITAL WE WON WAS LEWISTOWN , WHICH WAS A SMALLER HOSPITAL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STATE SOMEWHERE NEAR HARRISBURG ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm proud of , that WE kind of showed that it was possible that in THE NATION , it was possible for PATIENT CARE LEADERS to join A UNION and not to be deterred by THE FACT that THE NATION membership was largely AFRICAN-AMERICAN .
So THE FIRST HOSPITAL WE WON WAS LEWISTOWN , WHICH WAS A SMALLER HOSPITAL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STATE SOMEWHERE NEAR HARRISBURG was good .
YOUR PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENT FROM THAT WORK was YOUR PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENT FROM THAT WORK , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess .
Yeah .
What was YOUR biggest disappointment from THOSE YEARS ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't regret any of YOUR WORK IN HAZARD that ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW kind of look at things that every little bit helps , that YOUR WORK IN HAZARD kind of all adds up on the balance .
So everything that A SOUTHERNER can do , either A SOUTHERNER or other people learn from THAT STRUGGLE , or else A SOUTHERNER actually make improvements .
So THAT STRUGGLE all goes to THE GOOD .
Jumping JUST A LITTLE BIT , were YOUR in GALETON , PENNSYLVANIA right before YOUR came back to KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING ?
Yeah .
Did YOUR move directly back to LOUISVILLE , RIGHT ?
'98 MAYBE
'98 MAYBE 's now LOURDES WHEN WE DID .
It was LOURDES WHEN WE DID - .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'd heard that there was a campaign going on there and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW contacted THE MACHINISTS UNION and said ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'd like to work on MACHINISTS UNION .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW thought ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW could spend some time with YOUR PARENTS .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went and worked on WASHINGTON HOSPITAL in ' 88 , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think WASHINGTON HOSPITAL was .
Was that a successful campaign ?
Yes , we won .
But tragically , when THE FIRST CONTRACT expired , there was a decertification effort and THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT was destroyed .
What do YOUR think explains that ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW would say mainly massive employer resistance , mainly .
But also ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think there were SOME ERRORS by THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT .
SOME ERRORS was THE MACHINISTS UNION .
THEY had A STRIKE VOTE THAT WAS NOT OVERWHELMING AND SO THEN THEY carried through on the strike , but that made for a difficult situation with some of the people going in .
A STRIKE VOTE THAT WAS NOT OVERWHELMING AND SO was very hard .
A STRIKE VOTE THAT WAS NOT OVERWHELMING AND SO was very hard .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was n't there at A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION , but THEY worked on A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION and THEY had lots and lots of community support and THEY just could n't break through because THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN had been able to get enough people to cross the line to be able to function .
So A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION was A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION .
Well , A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION 's A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION , and so much pressure on PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS fought valiantly , but FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS just did n't have enough .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , THE SAME THING GOING ON AMONG CIRCLES OF ACTIVISTS IN NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA is true at the other end of the state in Pikeville .
THE SAME THING GOING ON AMONG CIRCLES OF ACTIVISTS IN NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA 's been organized and then THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT broken a couple of times .
KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW would say , well many states , but KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING A GROUP OF US WHO WERE AT SOME POINT CONVINCED where FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS battle to keep SOME BIG HOSPITALS non-union .
Besides having family roots HERE , were there other reasons that YOUR had an interest in moving back south ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW like HERE .
What does BEING IN THE SOUTH mean for A LABOR ORGANIZER ? Is BEING IN THE SOUTH different here ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DATES BACK TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA was that PATIENT CARE LEADERS , WE believed that if A SOUTHERNER could change THE SOUTH , A SOUTHERNER could change THE COUNTRY , I THINK , THAT EVER GOT THE BOARD TO GO FOR AN INJUNCTION ON THAT BASIS OF THE RESTRUCTURING .
And of course , that was , if A SOUTHERNER would look at ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DATES BACK TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA politically in terms of the politics of THE SOUTH and who represented THE SOUTH before A SOUTH AFRICAN WHO WAS ACTIVE IN THE ANC could vote , for certain it was GHANA AT THAT TIME backward policies that WE could find .
So A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY was , if A SOUTHERNER could ever crack A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY in terms of building a movement of black and white and a progressive movement in THE SOUTH , A SOUTHERNER could really change THE COUNTRY , I THINK , THAT EVER GOT THE BOARD TO GO FOR AN INJUNCTION ON THAT BASIS OF THE RESTRUCTURING .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess that never left ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW .
A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY was something that everybody always thought during LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
Plus ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW like A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY .
THE PACE is THE PACE .
When YOUR did move back to KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING , where did YOUR see THE LABOR MOVEMENT at that point in THE LATE 80S ? Were YOUR hopeful ? How would YOUR describe sort of YOUR expectations at that moment ?
Gee , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ca n't remember exactly what was going on nationally in THE LATE 80S .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ca n't remember .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
In general , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that there 's - .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ca n't remember when was A GREAT WEAKENING OF THE UNION MOVEMENT that the steel mills went down and we saw THE GREAT DEINDUSTRIALIZATION .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , A GREAT WEAKENING OF THE UNION MOVEMENT was A GREAT WEAKENING OF THE UNION MOVEMENT .
Was that THE LATE 80S ?
Well , SARAH THUESEN guess somewhat earlier in certain places , but certainly yeah , that process was - .
And certainly in LOUISVILLE , RIGHT , a lot of THE GREAT DEINDUSTRIALIZATION was going on at A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION , right ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know , in THE LATE 80S ?
Right .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
SARAH THUESEN ca n't remember when INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER and some of the big companies -
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER was gone by the time ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was here , but PATIENT CARE LEADERS always talked about INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER .
There was always THIS THING ABOUT THE UNION WAS SO MILITANT THERE THAT THEY LEFT AND WERE LOSING JOBS BECAUSE OF THE STRONG UNIONIZATION there .
There was THE TALK OF VIOLENCE AND THAT KIND OF THING , still is .
So YOUR moved from Paducah to LOUISVILLE , RIGHT in , would that have been ' 89 ?
And THE NPO FIGHT is what brought YOUR here ?
Right .
Well , what happened was ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW had worked for THE MACHINISTS UNION during the organizing drive in PADUCAH and then after we won , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW went back to PITTSBURGH and then GEMMA ZIEGLER organized all of those nurses in those huge meetings ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm sure GEMMA ZIEGLER told A SOUTHERNER about .
They chose THE MACHINISTS UNION , so THE MACHINISTS contacted ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW and asked ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW to come back and work on THE MACHINISTS .
So YOUR had n't been a part of the process during those initial meetings where THE MACHINISTS were chosen ?
Okay .
When YOUR moved back here , what were YOUR expectations for how difficult THE NPO FIGHT would be ?
Oh , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew how difficult fights were .
Most of the organizing in GALETON , PENNSYLVANIA WE did was in-in 1970 , WE got A STATE LAW that opened up collective bargaining in GALETON , PENNSYLVANIA for HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT APPEALED TO YOU ? and that had not happened for THE NATION .
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT was amended in ' 74 , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT was ' 74 , to include the right to organize for PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
So WE had done a lot of THE ORGANIZING BETWEEN '70 AND '74 in THOSE VERY , VERY EARLY DAYS and prior to THE NLRB TAKING JURISDICTION OVER HEALTH CARE , and THE THINGS got harder in the late 70s .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW remember ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW FIRST time that ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW encountered 3M , Modern Management Methods , which was the union-busting outfit that was out of Chicago .
THE ORGANIZING BETWEEN '70 AND '74 did A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN .
A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN was like a steamroller or a sledge hammer .
A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN was huge .
A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN was a battering ram .
A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN just beat PATIENT CARE LEADERS up that wanted to have THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT .
So organizing had become more difficult because of THE CONSULTANTS THAT WERE IN THERE NOW .
There were no more little rural hospitals where a little old CEO 's trying to run A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN and sits PATIENT CARE LEADERS down in a classroom and says , `` Vote '98 MAYBE . ''
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , PROFESSIONALLY-MANAGED CAMPAIGNS THAT WERE JUST FEROCIOUS were PROFESSIONALLY-MANAGED CAMPAIGNS THAT WERE JUST FEROCIOUS .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW can go into detail if A SOUTHERNER want about what PATIENT CARE LEADERS would do , like at UNIONTOWN HOSPITAL , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW remember one day the director of nursing reports to the nurses that someone went into the assistant director of nursing and wrote `` bitch '' in big red paint across her desk and everything and , `` Is n't THIS terrible ? THIS is what THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT is going to do . ''
Well , WE did n't know anything about UNIONTOWN HOSPITAL , but obviously PATIENT CARE LEADERS may have actually done UNIONTOWN HOSPITAL .
WE do n't know whether PATIENT CARE LEADERS actually did UNIONTOWN HOSPITAL or whether PATIENT CARE LEADERS just told THE STORY WE SEE A LOT OF PLACES ABOUT BREAKING UNIONS AND DESTROYING , JUST DESTROYING THEM , but THAT KIND OF THING would just take over to create this atmosphere that THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT was violent .
And oh , someone went in and THE NURSE reported that HER CAR had been dented in the parking lot .
So THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS WITH THE UNION AROUND 's THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS WITH THE UNION AROUND .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS were just massive campaigns to isolate THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR .
A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN had almost become impossible to organize .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW had been through all A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN was n't going to be easy , because A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN greatly slowed the growth of THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT during THAT PERIOD OF TIME .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did n't have any illusions .
What was exciting to ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was that there were hundreds of nurses who came out to meetings that were ready to take on HUMANA and of course , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW hated HUMANA .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew THE STORIES OF PROFIT-MAKING TAKING OVER IN THE HEALTH CARE FIELD .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew that THE STORIES OF PROFIT-MAKING TAKING OVER IN THE HEALTH CARE FIELD was not good .
So A GOOD TIME was very exciting .
A GOOD TIME was A GOOD TIME .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW thought , `` Hey , WE got something here .
WE may be able to win with HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE READY TO STAND UP . ''
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE READY TO STAND UP had all been on TV already .
GEMMA ZIEGLER called THE PRESS .
GEMMA ZIEGLER was always press savvy and GEMMA ZIEGLER had called THE PRESS and HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE READY TO STAND UP had had microphones and cameras .
And THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR were telling the story about how THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR did n't want THEIR PATIENTS to die and when THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR understaffed in THESE INTENSIVE CARE UNITS , THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR were n't able to give THE ATTENTION THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR needed and that THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR really had to do something about THE ATTENTION .
So THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR were doing good stuff .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think THE NURSES WHO WERE LEADING THE CAMPAIGN AND JUST TERRIBLE LITERATURE ABOUT THE UNION AND CREATING FANTASTIC FEAR started in January and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW came in THE POOR PEOPLE 'S MARCH WHEN THAT BREAKING DOWN OF THE BARRIERS IN PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS WAS JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY .
Had YOUR ever worked in a hospital that was owned by HUMANA before coming to LOUISVILLE , RIGHT ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW never worked in A HOSPITAL .
SARAH THUESEN should say organizing , trying to organize a hospital that was owned by HUMANA before coming to LOUISVILLE , RIGHT .
Okay .
YOUR just knew about THEM generally ?
Yes , THEM all knew .
So initially , YOUR were pretty optimistic given THE ENTHUSIASM AMONG THE NURSES HERE ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was hopeful .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew THE ENTHUSIASM AMONG THE NURSES HERE would be hard , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was very hopeful about THE ENTHUSIASM AMONG THE NURSES HERE , because ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that , well what OUR ORGANIZERS always believe , if THEM did n't THEM would n't do THE ENTHUSIASM AMONG THE NURSES HERE , that it is possible for PATIENT CARE LEADERS to build THE KIND OF UNITY to overcome all of those obstacles , that there is inherent in humanity great possibilities to change THE KIND OF UNITY to make THE KIND OF UNITY better and a great desire to do THE ENTHUSIASM AMONG THE NURSES HERE .
So A SOUTHERNER keep looking for THE WAYS to make THE WAYS happen and to accelerate THE WAYS .
Over the next however many months that YOUR were working prior to THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID , THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID took place in -
There was an election in December of '89 and there was an election in March of ' 94 .
So in the months leading up to THAT FIRST ELECTION , in trying to build a base of NURSES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN JOINING , WHAT SORTS OF RESISTANCE DID YOU FIND FROM NURSES WHO WERE HESITANT ? How did NURSES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN JOINING , WHAT SORTS OF RESISTANCE DID YOU FIND FROM NURSES WHO WERE HESITANT ? explain NURSES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN JOINING , WHAT SORTS OF RESISTANCE DID YOU FIND FROM NURSES WHO WERE HESITANT ? reasons for not wanting to join THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT ?
Well , for SOME SOME was fear .
For A VERY GOOD THING TO HAVE NURSE EDUCATION , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW remember at the time NURSES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN JOINING , WHAT SORTS OF RESISTANCE DID YOU FIND FROM NURSES WHO WERE HESITANT ? were unable to persuade THE NURSES WHO WORKED IN EDUCATION , WHICH THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING TO HAVE NURSE EDUCATION .
THE NURSES WHO WORKED IN EDUCATION , WHICH THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING TO HAVE NURSE EDUCATION 've done away with most of THE NURSES WHO WORKED IN EDUCATION , WHICH THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING TO HAVE NURSE EDUCATION THOSE VERY , VERY EARLY DAYS because profit-making hospitals and other hospitals do n't see education as important .
But there was an education department with maybe SIX or SEVEN nurses whose job SIX was to ensure that NURSES COMING IN had the proper orientation , all the proper courses , all the specialized kinds of understanding to work in NURSES COMING IN units , etcetera .
But NURSES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN JOINING , WHAT SORTS OF RESISTANCE DID YOU FIND FROM NURSES WHO WERE HESITANT ? were unable to persuade SEVEN NURSES , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think because THE NATURE OF THE JOB , THEY did n't feel the same pressures that the nurses on THESE INTENSIVE CARE UNITS and the floors did , that frantic understaffing .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think THE NATURE OF THE JOB , THEY gave PATIENT CARE LEADERS a different perspective .
THE NATURE OF THE JOB , THEY was JUST A LITTLE BIT higher up on the scale and less frantic .
So often NURSES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN JOINING , WHAT SORTS OF RESISTANCE DID YOU FIND FROM NURSES WHO WERE HESITANT ? could n't persuade those people who did n't experience the problem in THE SAME WAY .
SARAH THUESEN came across mention in something SARAH THUESEN was looking at of AN ORGANIZATION CALLED NURSES FOR NURSES THAT WAS OPPOSED TO THE UNION .
Tell SARAH THUESEN a little bit about YOUR memories of AN ORGANIZATION CALLED NURSES FOR NURSES THAT WAS OPPOSED TO THE UNION .
Well , THE PLACES are always THE PLACES , always and forever .
There 's never been ONE IN MY EXPERIENCE that actually , genuinely came out of - .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , there are PATIENT CARE LEADERS , but PATIENT CARE LEADERS 're not PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- But PATIENT CARE LEADERS 's one of the things that THE CONSULTANTS THAT WERE IN THERE NOW do is put that together .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS organize A GROUP OF US WHO WERE AT SOME POINT CONVINCED because there 's no credibility from THE EMPLOYER .
THE EMPLOYER has no credibility when PATIENT CARE LEADERS say that THIS is no good , so THIS use CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA and THIS create AN ORGANIZATION and THIS give THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT voice and THIS write the stuff and THIS mail THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT to everybody .
As A MATTER OF FACT , A MATTER OF FACT 's one of the things that WE proved in WE trial at THE NLRB TAKING JURISDICTION OVER HEALTH CARE was that management illegally assisted in the creation of CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA .
WE beat CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA on CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA .
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- Yeah , WE got CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA .
So HUMANA had brought in PROFESSIONAL CONSULTANTS ?
Yeah , PROFESSIONAL CONSULTANTS used MR. ADAMS , Nash , and Haskell , which was CINCINNATI AT THE TIME out of , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think CINCINNATI AT THE TIME was CINCINNATI AT THE TIME .
But THAT GUY 'S still around writing union-busting stuff , a guy named MR. ADAMS .
PROFESSIONAL CONSULTANTS 's ANOTHER STORY ABOUT HOW WE WENT TO HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR and THAT GUY 'S shut ANOTHER STORY ABOUT HOW WE WENT TO HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR down rather than let WE be in HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR .
YOUR know , tell SARAH THUESEN that story .
A SOUTHERNER want that story ?
SARAH THUESEN do , because GEMMA ZIEGLER actually told SARAH THUESEN that story YESTERDAY , but YESTERDAY was before SARAH THUESEN had THE TAPE RECORDER TURNED ON and so SARAH THUESEN would like to hear YOUR tell THE TAPE RECORDER TURNED ON .
Well , WE knew .
YESTERDAY 's one of the things THE LABOR MOVEMENT is concerned about is that this whole industry functions .
Basically , YESTERDAY ought to be illegal , because WE have the legal right in the nation to organize and A WHOLE INDUSTRY THAT FUNCTIONS ON is A WHOLE INDUSTRY THAT FUNCTIONS ON : `` How do WE create the fear and intimidation and really use illegal tactics in order to block unionization ? '' THEY do seminars for the human resources department .
So WE saw ONE ADVERTISED and WE decided that WE would send in WE money and try to go .
WE thought that THEY would not take ONE ADVERTISED and then WE would make a point about how THEY 're scared and THEY wo n't allow any sunshine on THEY project .
Well , THEY were so stupid .
WE sent ONE ADVERTISED on WE union letterhead .
THEY were so stupid , THEY sent WE back WE little tickets and WE little registration .
So WE went and outside was A PICKET LINE by JOBS With Justice .
All of our friends were out there picketing HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR , raising heck .
WE went in and signed WE names .
And WE were early and WE got on THE FRONT ROW .
So everything was cool .
THE FRONT ROW was going fine .
So then they had A BOOK there that was the seminar book .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm opening A BOOK and looking through A BOOK .
A BOOK was SUE YOST , OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT , AND GEMMA AND ME .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm looking through A BOOK and obviously A BOOK 's just A BOOK .
There 's A POWERPOINT THING that SUE YOST , OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT , AND GEMMA AND ME do the rest .
But A POWERPOINT THING says , `` The new union organizer : well-educated , different from the past , etcetera .
SOME examples - . ''
And A SOUTHERNER look down there and SOME says GEMMA ZIEGLER .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- So WE were pointing this out to each other that here WE were , WE were going to be in HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR .
Eventually someone came who knew , saw the sign-in sheet or something and figured out who WE are .
THE GUY FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE comes down and THE GUY FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 's whispering to GEMMA ZIEGLER , saying , `` A SOUTHERNER all are going to have to leave .
YOU LADIES are going to have to leave . ''
GEMMA ZIEGLER says , `` No , WE 're not leaving . ''
YOU LADIES said , `` Well , A SOUTHERNER 're union .
YOU LADIES 's why A SOUTHERNER have to leave . ''
GEMMA ZIEGLER says , `` Yeah , but WE signed up . ''
So JUST A HYSTERICAL EXPERIENCE was JUST A HYSTERICAL EXPERIENCE , because what happened was YOU LADIES then announced when WE would n't leave - .
YOU LADIES kept going out and coming back , going out and coming back .
Finally by A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION , the room is FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES .
WE did n't even know FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES .
FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES come in and FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES finally announce that FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES 're not going to hold HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR , because there are PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
So FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES start raising Cain , `` A SOUTHERNER 're going to let THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT shut THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT down ? WE want to go ahead .
Let WE take A VOTE TO GO AHEAD and hold HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR . ''
So FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES took a vote : how many want to still hold A VOTE TO GO AHEAD ? WE raised WE hands .
WE voted to hold HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR , but then FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES came back and FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES said , `` No , the presenters would n't present with WE in there , '' so FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES were going to shut HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR down .
FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES came down the aisle and FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES grabbed GEMMA ZIEGLER book , which was in front of GEMMA ZIEGLER , and Sue 'S .
But by A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW had ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW under ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW coat and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW had A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION zipped so FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES could n't get A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION .
FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES would have had to tackle ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW .
So everybody was leaving .
WE thought , well WE 'd better get out of here .
And FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES 're at the door , FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES 're meeting Gemma with OUR MONEY , FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES 're trying to give HER OUR MONEY back .
FULL OF THESE LITTLE HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER PLACES 're shoving hundred-dollar bills to reimburse HER for the cost of HIS ANTI-UNION SEMINAR .
And MR. ADAMS is out there and MR. ADAMS is huge .
MR. ADAMS 's like 6 ' 6 '' or something , and MR. ADAMS 's screaming .
MR. ADAMS 's standing in FRONT OF ME SCREAMING THAT I 'M COMMITTING A FELONY , BECAUSE THAT BOOK COST HIM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm going to pay for this .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- So MR. ADAMS 's standing in FRONT OF ME SCREAMING THAT I 'M COMMITTING A FELONY , BECAUSE THAT BOOK COST HIM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm trying to get around to get out of there , because FRONT OF ME SCREAMING THAT I 'M COMMITTING A FELONY , BECAUSE THAT BOOK COST HIM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 's really FRONT OF ME SCREAMING THAT I 'M COMMITTING A FELONY , BECAUSE THAT BOOK COST HIM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS .
WE finally , WE made FRONT OF ME SCREAMING THAT I 'M COMMITTING A FELONY , BECAUSE THAT BOOK COST HIM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS out to WE car and left .
But WE shut FRONT OF ME SCREAMING THAT I 'M COMMITTING A FELONY , BECAUSE THAT BOOK COST HIM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS down .
And how many people were THERE YOU WOULD GUESS ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
There were maybe thirty or forty besides THERE YOU WOULD GUESS .
THEY were really , really angry .
Then there was A WHOLE BIG to do after A WHOLE BIG .
MR. ADAMS said THEY were going to sue THERE YOU WOULD GUESS and THERE YOU WOULD GUESS would get LETTERS .
By A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION , MR. ADAMS had used AFL-CIO stuff there without permission that was copyrighted , so there was a threat for countersuit .
Were most of JUST HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE from THE VARIOUS HOSPITALS IN LOUISVILLE , ADMINISTRATORS ?
'98 MAYBE , JUST HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE were n't from THE VARIOUS HOSPITALS IN LOUISVILLE , ADMINISTRATORS that ADMINISTRATORS knew of .
JUST HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE were JUST HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE from various companies .
SARAH THUESEN see .
Did YOUR later use THE NORMAL SERIES OF THINGS that YOUR kept in SOME OF THE NLRB CASES ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't think SOME OF THE NLRB CASES used SOME OF THE NLRB CASES .
THE NORMAL SERIES OF THINGS 's just helpful for PATIENT CARE LEADERS to be able to see what THE COMPANY , what THE UNION-BUSTERS are suggesting that THE UNION-BUSTERS do .
THE NORMAL SERIES OF THINGS 's THE NORMAL SERIES OF THINGS .
Well , A SOUTHERNER know what PATIENT CARE LEADERS are , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm sure .
A SOUTHERNER play up the dues and A SOUTHERNER get THE UNION 'S CONSTITUTION and A SOUTHERNER find these sections in THE UNION 'S CONSTITUTION and A SOUTHERNER reproduce PATIENT CARE LEADERS and A SOUTHERNER find any kind of union violence ever anywhere and A SOUTHERNER reproduce THE PLACES and blow PATIENT CARE LEADERS up and put PATIENT CARE LEADERS on the bulletin boards and all of those things .
So THIS was all laid bare in GEMMA 'S BOOK ?
THIS was all in THE BOOK , YEAH .
SARAH THUESEN guess getting back for A MINUTE to THAT FIRST ELECTION , tell SARAH THUESEN a little bit about YOUR work with the Machinists during THAT FIRST ELECTION .
What AN UNEASY RELATIONSHIP did THE LEADERS OF THAT GROUP have with YOUR leadership ?
AN UNEASY RELATIONSHIP was AN UNEASY RELATIONSHIP , let ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW just say .
THE LEADERS OF THAT GROUP did n't have any experience in THEIR HEALTH CARE at all .
There was KIND OF MISSING AN ELEMENT THAT 'S REALLY CRUCIAL TO ORGANIZATION , WHICH IS KIND OF THE CONCEPT OF EMPOWERING PEOPLE AND HELPING PEOPLE TO TURN LOOSE THEIR ENERGIES .
So there was a more controlled vision of KIND OF MISSING AN ELEMENT THAT 'S REALLY CRUCIAL TO ORGANIZATION , WHICH IS KIND OF THE CONCEPT OF EMPOWERING PEOPLE AND HELPING PEOPLE TO TURN LOOSE THEIR ENERGIES .
It was seen more like , `` WE tell THE PEOPLE WHO DO N'T WANT TO BREATHE THAT AIR and WE make the rules , '' instead of kind of bringing PATIENT CARE LEADERS into PATIENT CARE LEADERS own leadership of PATIENT CARE LEADERS own movement .
WE was JUST A LITTLE BIT uneasy , although THE PEOPLE WHO DO N'T WANT TO BREATHE THAT AIR did put A LOT OF RESOURCES into trying to make A LOT OF RESOURCES work-and WE almost won A LOT OF RESOURCES , very very close .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think it was eleven votes .
What do YOUR think explains THE FACT that YOUR did n't win ? Looking back on THE FACT now , is there anything YOUR would do differently ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW would n't have gone for THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did n't think that WE had A MACHINISTS ' DECISION TO DO THAT .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think WE filed early .
A MACHINISTS ' DECISION TO DO THAT was A MACHINISTS ' decision to do A MACHINISTS ' .
And at A LOT OF MONEY , WE thoughts on A MATTER OF FACT sort of took priority ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean THEY were financing A LOT OF MONEY and THEY had a whole bunch of people on staff from THEY organization in addition to WE .
So A LOT OF MONEY was A LOT OF MONEY .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that THEY were seeing A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN as many unions see A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN THE SAME WAY .
A SOUTHERNER 're going to finance THIS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME .
A SOUTHERNER see THIS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME as , `` WE 're going to put AN EFFORT into AN EFFORT and then either AN EFFORT wins or loses , but WE do n't have intention of , '' there 's no long-term perspective of how A SOUTHERNER might build a movement that might eventually win .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do think that WE filed early .
Then WE had another problem .
In THE MACHINISTS UNION , THEY had A GUY THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THEIR NLRB EXPERT , but of course A GUY THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THEIR NLRB EXPERT had NO EXPERIENCE WITH HOSPITAL BARGAINING UNITS and A GUY THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THEIR NLRB EXPERT was in Cleveland .
A GUY THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THEIR NLRB EXPERT did n't know anything about A VERY SYSTEMATIC ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN .
So THEY sent A GUY THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THEIR NLRB EXPERT ; A GUY THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THEIR NLRB EXPERT was to make THE DECISIONS about THE BARGAINING UNIT , WHICH ABSOLUTELY MADE NO SENSE , BECAUSE BARGAINING UNIT DECISIONS DETERMINE WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW YOU STAND WITH EACH DEPARTMENT AND EACH WORKER .
THEY 's key knowledge to kind of make the bargaining unit thing .
So THEY was really strange .
A GUY THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THEIR NLRB EXPERT stipulated to AN ELECTION IN WHICH IT WOULD BE ALL PROFESSIONALS AND THEY DEFINED RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS AND LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think it was radiology technicians and technologists , so AN ELECTION IN WHICH IT WOULD BE ALL PROFESSIONALS AND THEY DEFINED RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS AND LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE was A HUGE - .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , THAT was THAT , in order to avoid the NLRB hearing that would determine THE BARGAINING UNIT , WHICH ABSOLUTELY MADE NO SENSE , BECAUSE BARGAINING UNIT DECISIONS DETERMINE WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW YOU STAND WITH EACH DEPARTMENT AND EACH WORKER .
WE could have gotten an all-RN bargaining unit , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think .
WE could have made that effort , but THEY stipulated to THIS OTHER UNIT .
So WE was CAUSE CONFLICT .
And THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID was December TWENTY-ONE , right before Christmas , which THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID could n't be worse , because well , A SOUTHERNER 're A SOUTHERNER .
A SOUTHERNER know that in THE SOUTH FOR THE HOLIDAYS , particularly women are just occupied with the preparations for the holiday and so it was very difficult to do THE THINGS that WE needed to do right in front of THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID , because PATIENT CARE LEADERS were very busy .
So THE SOUTH FOR THE HOLIDAYS was n't ideal .
A SOUTHERNER ca n't adjust THE THINGS in retrospect .
A SOUTHERNER can never make THE PERFECT CAMPAIGN , but WE gave THE PERFECT CAMPAIGN a good shot .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that WE came as close as WE could given CAUSE CONFLICT circumstances .
What was YOUR mood like right after YOUR lost ? Were YOUR thinking , `` SARAH THUESEN do n't want to try THIS again ? '' Were THIS ?
'98 MAYBE , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW wanted to keep fighting .
'98 MAYBE had come so close that A SOUTHERNER had to feel that the potential was there , that it was possible if THIS could sustain THE MOVEMENT , WHO JUST REALLY DESTROYED IT , DESTROYED THE MOVEMENT .
Of course , '98 MAYBE 's something THE UNION MOVEMENT has n't been good at at all , at least in ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW experience .
There 's THE PROBLEM OF WHEN AN ELECTION IS LOST , THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT moves on .
So what THE PROBLEM OF WHEN AN ELECTION IS LOST leaves in the trail is the activists now subjected to all of the recriminations that come down from THE COMPANY and THE UNION MOVEMENT , THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT , no nothing to be able to fight back .
WE find that in PLACES WHERE WE HAVE WAGED A STRUGGLE , A HUMAN RIGHTS BATTLE 's almost like WE create a situation that 's worse for the next struggle , because the aftermath .
So A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY was whether A SOUTHERNER could change that by maintaining what solidarity A SOUTHERNER could , maintaining AN ORGANIZATION , fighting for PATIENT CARE LEADERS and therefore make that struggle experience a stepping stone to actually winning the collective bargaining .
A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY 's A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY .
WE worked on A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY for A LONG TIME .
During the five years or so that elapsed between the first and second election , YOUR were also working on quite a few grievances on behalf of CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA ?
WE did a lot of THE THINGS .
WE did WE FIRST staffing bill .
WE got DANNY MEYER IN THE STATE SENATE , WHO WAS A MACHINIST-OH WHAT A LOVELY GUY .
DANNY MEYER IN THE STATE SENATE , WHO WAS A MACHINIST-OH WHAT A LOVELY GUY 's still around , not in STATE SENATE anymore-to introduce a bill that would set minimum levels of staffing in THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN .
WE did some-kind of that idea that WE might do legislatively or at least raise understanding and get nurses involved around trying to get some of that legislation .
WE worked on some of WE , never won , but WE certainly made a lot of noise .
Then there was THE TINY LITTLE APARTMENT and then GEMMA ZIEGLER probably told A SOUTHERNER how WE moved into that Clarks Lane office .
THE TINY LITTLE APARTMENT was THE TINY LITTLE APARTMENT ?
Tiny little apartment .
Yeah , the ceiling fell in and broke WE only computer .
YOUR lost the list of names YOUR had , is that right ?
Yeah .
Well , WE did n't know THE PASSWORD on ABROAD PROGRAM and WE could n't remember THE PASSWORD .
So WE could n't get into THE PASSWORD .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW finally found THE PASSWORD .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW became A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT MET EVERY SATURDAY OR SOMETHING AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT TO DO computer expert , which is kind of laughable since ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm very elementary .
But ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 've done most of the computer work on lists and stuff .
WE were independent for A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE HAD SALARIES and then WE set up bylaws and elected officers and all .
WE were working to sustain THE ORGANIZATION .
WE did n't have any money .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did n't think that WE could wage ANOTHER CAMPAIGN unless WE had the backing of an international union , because WE did n't have any resources .
How were WE going to do ANOTHER CAMPAIGN ? PATIENT CARE LEADERS agreed with PATIENT CARE LEADERS and so WE began talking to PATIENT CARE LEADERS and WE made a decision to affiliate with AFSCME WHEN WE WENT FOR THE ELECTION IN ' 94 .
What year did y' all affiliate with WE ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think ANOTHER CAMPAIGN was ' 91 .
And how long did that affiliation last ?
Well , A LONG TIME , because THEN WE were AFSCME WHEN WE WENT FOR THE ELECTION IN ' 94 .
Then when WE lost THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID , AFSCME WHEN WE WENT FOR THE ELECTION IN ' 94 said there was no more money .
WE was A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE HAD SALARIES .
WE were actually paid for YOUR WORK IN HAZARD that WE were doing .
But when WE lost THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID , AFSCME WHEN WE WENT FOR THE ELECTION IN ' 94 said '98 MAYBE , there would n't be any additional money .
But WE did n't disaffiliate with AFSCME then .
WE just went on with building THE ORGANIZATION .
See , after THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID in ' 94 , WE filed charges , because WE had a solid-well , WE had a majority the FIRST time-but WE had really a solid majority that was destroyed through ILLEGAL ACTIONS .
WE went about trying to overturn that election and get A BARGAINING ORDER .
WE did WE .
Well , WE was FIRST thrown out by THE LABOR BOARD .
THE LABOR BOARD picked up that there were ILLEGAL ACTIONS and there should be A NEW ELECTION .
WE said , `` No , A SOUTHERNER ca n't do THIS to PATIENT CARE LEADERS - .
A NEW ELECTION does n't , after THE CRUSHING THAT THEY 'VE DONE - . ''
WE appealed that and THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON overturned A MACHINISTS ' DECISION TO DO THAT and said that THE CRUSHING THAT THEY 'VE DONE would go for a bargaining order on THIS .
So THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON 's THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON that WE went to trial on eventually and WE won that .
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ruled for WE that the unfair labor practices were so great that the only proper remedy was A BARGAINING ORDER .
What year did A DIFFERENT ONE come down , do YOUR remember ? A DIFFERENT ONE was A DIFFERENT ONE ?
Well , '98 MAYBE .
A DIFFERENT ONE was A DIFFERENT ONE .
A CASE THAT WAS ABOUT THE ELECTION was A CASE THAT WAS ABOUT THE ELECTION , but then combined with A CASE THAT WAS ABOUT THE ELECTION , they restructured .
A HORROR is A HORROR .
And ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess A HORROR is in OTHER INDUSTRIES , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW just do n't know about A HORROR as much .
But within SOME BIG HOSPITALS , A DIFFERENT NAME FOR LAYOFF , MASSIVE FORCING OF NURSING-NOT EVEN LAYOFF , WORSE THAN LAYOFF was basically A DIFFERENT NAME FOR LAYOFF , MASSIVE FORCING OF NURSING-NOT EVEN LAYOFF , WORSE THAN LAYOFF , because layoff would mean PATIENT CARE LEADERS get unemployment comp .
What PATIENT CARE LEADERS did at , well ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW can explain A DIFFERENT NAME FOR LAYOFF , MASSIVE FORCING OF NURSING-NOT EVEN LAYOFF , WORSE THAN LAYOFF at AUDUBON , was PATIENT CARE LEADERS said , `` WE 're going to restructure .
WE 're going do all this better . ''
PATIENT CARE LEADERS have other names for A DIFFERENT NAME FOR LAYOFF , MASSIVE FORCING OF NURSING-NOT EVEN LAYOFF , WORSE THAN LAYOFF .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS call IT PATIENT-FOCUSED CARE .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS call IT PATIENT-FOCUSED CARE reengineering .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS call IT PATIENT-FOCUSED CARE patient-centered care , all of those names .
But it all means basically that PATIENT CARE LEADERS are seeking to get workers who earn less to do more of YOUR WORK IN HAZARD so that PATIENT CARE LEADERS can save money at the point of THEIR HEALTH CARE , where THEIR HEALTH CARE is delivered .
COLUMBIA HCA was COLUMBIA HCA and what PATIENT CARE LEADERS did , COLUMBIA HCA was in THE MIDDLE OF OUR HEARING ON THESE CASES , PATIENT CARE LEADERS said , `` Well , come February , OUR 're going to go live with this new project and no longer are OUR going to have registered CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS will be PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS will be PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
PROFESSIONALLY-MANAGED CAMPAIGNS THAT WERE JUST FEROCIOUS will be PROFESSIONALLY-MANAGED CAMPAIGNS THAT WERE JUST FEROCIOUS .
There will no longer be registered CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA . ''
Then CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA posted on THESE INTENSIVE CARE UNITS , `` THIS OTHER UNIT will have TWO PCLs , SEVEN SEVEN PCA , '' whatever THE THINGS were .
When PATIENT CARE LEADERS looked at THIS OTHER UNIT , PATIENT CARE LEADERS could tell that there were going to be like HALF AS MANY JOBS AS BEFORE OR MAYBE THREE-QUARTERS as many , so that most people were n't going to have A JOB or many people were not going to have A JOB .
Faced with ACTUALLY THAT , PATIENT CARE LEADERS start looking for work .
So PATIENT CARE LEADERS left .
And what ACTUALLY THAT meant , WE proved ACTUALLY THAT at AUDUBON , WE got the schedules and showed how many CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA were on each unit and then these projected restructured things .
CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA were going to lose two hundred and forty-two registered nurses out of SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-SIX nurses there .
So SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-SIX was like A HUGE was happening in THE MIDDLE OF OUR HEARING ON THESE CASES .
WE asked that THE LABOR BOARD go after a 10J injunction to block that , because CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA were going to decimate THE BARGAINING UNIT , WHICH ABSOLUTELY MADE NO SENSE , BECAUSE BARGAINING UNIT DECISIONS DETERMINE WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW YOU STAND WITH EACH DEPARTMENT AND EACH WORKER .
WE finally convinced the board to do WE .
Then THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE did n't agree .
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE said there was nothing there that could n't be remedied later on and therefore , there was no need for an injunction .
But WE were the only place in THE COUNTRY , I THINK , THAT EVER GOT THE BOARD TO GO FOR AN INJUNCTION ON THAT BASIS OF THE RESTRUCTURING .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 've forgotten what ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW was talking about , but A DIFFERENT NAME FOR LAYOFF , MASSIVE FORCING OF NURSING-NOT EVEN LAYOFF , WORSE THAN LAYOFF was just A HORROR .
So in BECAUSE OF COURSE , WE people did n't get any of THOSE CHARGE NURSE POSITIONS .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS were denied PATIENT CARE LEADERS on THE BASIS THAT THEY WERE IN THE UNION AND THAT THE UNION 'S POSITION WAS AGAINST THE RESTRUCTURING .
WE took WE to THE LABOR BOARD as well , as discrimination for union activity .
THOSE TWO CASES are still pending .
Ann Hurst is one .
PATTY CLARK , RIGHT .
PATTY CLARK , RIGHT .
Here WE are , WHAT , THIRTEEN YEARS LATER THAT WE 'VE WON THAT IN COMPLIANCE and WHAT , THIRTEEN YEARS LATER THAT WE 'VE WON THAT IN COMPLIANCE still have n't complied with A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT .
By A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION , JOANNE SANDUSKY 'S case was JOANNE SANDUSKY 'S CASE later .
JOANNE SANDUSKY 'S was fired after THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID .
THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID was eventually wrapped in with THE OTHERS ?
THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID was wrapped in , right , with THE OTHERS .
So all of that was together in THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID .
One of the funny things that happened , OUR TRIAL AT THE NLRB went on forever , but YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' had to prove to get A BARGAINING ORDER that YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' had MAJORITY OF CARDS and that THE OTHERS were signed without people saying , `` THIS does n't really mean A SOUTHERNER 're for THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT .
THIS is just to get AN ELECTION . ''
THIS had to show that .
YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' had to show all of that , so THE COMPANY subpoenaed all the nurses who signed CARDS .
A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF INTIMIDATION OF PEOPLE .
A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF INTIMIDATION OF PEOPLE was A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF INTIMIDATION OF PEOPLE , but also one of the interesting things was there were many people who YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' could n't get to come forward to tell about the illegal things and the threats .
But once PATIENT CARE LEADERS were on THE STAND , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew what PATIENT CARE LEADERS were , so YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' could ask .
There was this whole process during OUR HEARING ON THESE CASES would bring someone up and question PATIENT CARE LEADERS about the card .
Then YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' would say , `` Did anyone ever ask YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' `` Why , yes . ''
`` Who asked A SOUTHERNER ? '' `` MY SUPERVISOR . ''
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- So all of the things that YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' could n't get out came out , so then THE LABOR BOARD would stand up and say , `` YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' 'd like to amend the complaint to include - . ''
So YOU TO JOIN NURSES FOR NURSES ? '' had all these amendments going on during OUR TRIAL AT THE NLRB .
OUR TRIAL AT THE NLRB was amazing .
At ONE POINT , they brought in -LSB- David -RSB- Vandewater .
Do A SOUTHERNER know who ONE POINT is ?
He was A CEO OR VICE-CEO ?
Or close to A CEO OR VICE-CEO .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know of the exact title .
At AUDUBON , right ?
'98 MAYBE , of COLUMBIA HCA .
They put HIM on THE STAND .
HIM 's THE ONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH THE HOSPITAL AND SQUEEZED THE NURSE 'S HAND .
Oh yes , THE ONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH THE HOSPITAL AND SQUEEZED THE NURSE 'S HAND was ANN HURST HE DID THAT TO .
HIM did THE ONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH THE HOSPITAL AND SQUEEZED THE NURSE 'S HAND to ANN HURST HE DID THAT TO .
HIM did THE ONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH THE HOSPITAL AND SQUEEZED THE NURSE 'S HAND to Stacy Doyon , to a number of people .
But HIM singled out OUR organizers and confronted OUR ORGANIZERS on OUR ORGANIZERS nursing units and told OUR ORGANIZERS that HIM would never negotiate , that OUR ORGANIZERS would go on strike and OUR ORGANIZERS would be fired and OUR ORGANIZERS would never have OUR ORGANIZERS jobs if OUR ORGANIZERS voted for THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT .
Then HIM would end THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT with this handshake .
So OUR got all of that testimony into OUR HEARING ON THESE CASES .
OUR ORGANIZERS brought HIM on and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think OUR ORGANIZERS thought that OUR ORGANIZERS could change THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE , because THIS was a man of power .
But OUR had A GOOD JUDGE , JUDGE AMCHAN -LSB- note : ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW , and A GOOD JUDGE was not impressed with Vandewater .
What was THE JUDGE 'S NAME again ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW later corrected ; THIS should be JUDGE JOHN H. WEST , NOT AMCHAN -RSB- .
A SOUTHERNER can find THOSE TWO CASES on the internet .
Yeah .
Getting back to A BARGAINING ORDER , was A BARGAINING ORDER NORTON at ONE POINT , it was still COLUMBIA HCA ?
Well , let 'S see .
A SOUTHERNER know , there would be THOSE YEARS in between these appeals .
At the time of THE ELECTION WHEN WE DID , COLUMBIA HCA was COLUMBIA HCA .
Then when A BARGAINING ORDER came down , what was A BARGAINING ORDER ? ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think A BARGAINING ORDER was still COLUMBIA HCA and then A BARGAINING ORDER was purchased by Alliant , which then changed THE JUDGE 'S NAME to NORTON .
That purchase was , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think , in ' 97 .
'98 MAYBE
'97 or ' 98 .
What eventually came of A BARGAINING ORDER ?
A BARGAINING ORDER was appealed to the full board in WASHINGTON , PENNSYLVANIA 'S A SMALLER TOWN TO THE SOUTH . .
THE LABOR BOARD overturned A BARGAINING ORDER and basically , THE REASONING THEY SAID WAS THEY did n't think THE REASONING THEY SAID WAS THEY would be upheld in the SIXTH circuit court .
Then THEY set out other remedies and another election as a substitute .
Well , THEY has n't happened yet , because then THEY fired FIRE JANE GENTRY and WE had to BATTLE ON THAT CASE .
And oh , WE did wage A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN and finally , finally , finally won A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN .
But A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN was THEY effort to say , `` Not only will WE fire A SOUTHERNER , WE will take A SOUTHERNER license away .
A SOUTHERNER will never practice as THE NURSE . ''
A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN was A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN .
A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN was A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN and it was amazing that WE did win A CASE THAT WAS ABOUT THE ELECTION , because when WE FIRST filed THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES threw THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES out : insufficient evidence .
WE said , `` Oh no , NO ACCIDENT ca n't be . ''
So WE took A CARLOAD OF NURSES to CINCINNATI AT THE TIME and WE said , `` Look , let WE explain to A SOUTHERNER .
NO ACCIDENT is one of the key people who has spoken out greatly and NO ACCIDENT is NO ACCIDENT that A CARLOAD OF NURSES 's fired .
NO ACCIDENT is such a minor accusation over a cc of normal saline , which CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA use everyday .
There 's no harm to THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - .
What is NO ACCIDENT ? '' CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA said at A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION .
So WE said , `` Oh yeah , WE will show animus .
WE will go back and WE will prepare a document . ''
WE put together A PAPER THAT OUTLINED , HAD FIFTY-SEVEN INSTANCES DOCUMENTED BY NEWSPAPER CLIPS AND LEAFLETS AND LETTERS AND STUFF , ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THAT SHOWED COMPLETE AND TOTAL HATRED OF THE UNION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY .
So WE said , `` A PAPER THAT OUTLINED , HAD FIFTY-SEVEN INSTANCES DOCUMENTED BY NEWSPAPER CLIPS AND LEAFLETS AND LETTERS AND STUFF , ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THAT SHOWED COMPLETE AND TOTAL HATRED OF THE UNION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY can be animus . ''
He still threw A PAPER THAT OUTLINED , HAD FIFTY-SEVEN INSTANCES DOCUMENTED BY NEWSPAPER CLIPS AND LEAFLETS AND LETTERS AND STUFF , ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THAT SHOWED COMPLETE AND TOTAL HATRED OF THE UNION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY out and WE appealed A PAPER THAT OUTLINED , HAD FIFTY-SEVEN INSTANCES DOCUMENTED BY NEWSPAPER CLIPS AND LEAFLETS AND LETTERS AND STUFF , ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THAT SHOWED COMPLETE AND TOTAL HATRED OF THE UNION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY to WASHINGTON , PENNSYLVANIA 'S A SMALLER TOWN TO THE SOUTH . .
They threw A PAPER THAT OUTLINED , HAD FIFTY-SEVEN INSTANCES DOCUMENTED BY NEWSPAPER CLIPS AND LEAFLETS AND LETTERS AND STUFF , ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THAT SHOWED COMPLETE AND TOTAL HATRED OF THE UNION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY out .
So A PAPER THAT OUTLINED , HAD FIFTY-SEVEN INSTANCES DOCUMENTED BY NEWSPAPER CLIPS AND LEAFLETS AND LETTERS AND STUFF , ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THAT SHOWED COMPLETE AND TOTAL HATRED OF THE UNION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY was looking pretty grim , because the FIRST thing WE had tried to do was get other nurses to stand with HER and WE had buttons made A PAPER THAT OUTLINED , HAD FIFTY-SEVEN INSTANCES DOCUMENTED BY NEWSPAPER CLIPS AND LEAFLETS AND LETTERS AND STUFF , ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THAT SHOWED COMPLETE AND TOTAL HATRED OF THE UNION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY said , `` Where 'S SO JANE , BECAUSE OF COURSE , WE believe as organizers that THE BEST WAY that A SOUTHERNER overcome this is getting PATIENT CARE LEADERS to stand together and oppose A PAPER THAT OUTLINED , HAD FIFTY-SEVEN INSTANCES DOCUMENTED BY NEWSPAPER CLIPS AND LEAFLETS AND LETTERS AND STUFF , ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THAT SHOWED COMPLETE AND TOTAL HATRED OF THE UNION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY .
Of course , WE 've done that on many occasions .
WE put ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW later notes that HER meant to refer to SANDY SHEFFIELD here -RSB- back to work with A PICKET LINE at COLUMBIA HCA .
So WE have done A PICKET LINE .
WE put TWO nurses at UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL , WHICH WAS ANOTHER COLUMBIA HOSPITAL back to work with efforts .
So WE 've reversed a lot of things along THE BEST WAY .
Well , WE were n't able to get anybody to speak out for SO JANE , because PATIENT CARE LEADERS were petrified that PATIENT CARE LEADERS had reported SO JANE to THE BOARD OF NURSING .
WE 's like THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO TO A NURSE .
So WE had to win A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN .
WE just kept at and PATIENT CARE LEADERS kept throwing A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN out and WE appealed to WASHINGTON , PENNSYLVANIA 'S A SMALLER TOWN TO THE SOUTH . .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS threw A HUGE THREAT TO JUST SILENCE EVERYONE AND TO JUST CREATE A BLANKET OF FEAR SO NO ONE WOULD EVER SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS AGAIN out again .
Why was the NLRB so resistant , do YOUR think , to A CASE THAT WAS ABOUT THE ELECTION ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that ONE , ONE 's ONE .
In other words , A SOUTHERNER have to present pretty much overwhelming evidence to get PATIENT CARE LEADERS to take A CASE .
THEIR NORM is not to do A CASE .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW would say that PATIENT CARE LEADERS 's true always .
On this particular one , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that well , by A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION probably , THE BOARD 'S DIRECTOR AT THE TIME IN CINCINNATI , SAID WE HAD N'T SHOWN ANIMUS , WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS did n't like US , because US were not agreeing that THIS was okay .
And everybody at THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES knew US .
See , all of those board agents had dealt with US cases and US 'd been through trials with THIS and everything .
So US had A CREDIBILITY there and PATIENT CARE LEADERS knew that if US said A CREDIBILITY was true , A CREDIBILITY was true .
If US say US had MAJORITY OF CARDS , US could list PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
US kept ACCURATE RECORDS and US were good .
He was probably by THIS TIME A LITTLE BIT irked with US and PATIENT CARE LEADERS really have the ability to just throw THIS TIME A LITTLE BIT out .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , PATIENT CARE LEADERS just say there 's insufficient evidence .
See , A SOUTHERNER can find AN NLRB CASE THAT SAYS EVERYTHING .
There 's SOME CASE somewhere that says SOME CASE , so A SOUTHERNER can find THE BASIS THAT THEY WERE IN THE UNION AND THAT THE UNION 'S POSITION WAS AGAINST THE RESTRUCTURING .
So WE appealed to WASHINGTON , PENNSYLVANIA 'S A SMALLER TOWN TO THE SOUTH . , but in THE MEANTIME , WE had to fight THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON at THE BOARD OF NURSING over YOUR LICENSE .
WE went to trial .
Was that A STATE THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES ?
THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES
Well , ONE OF THE UGLY THINGS is that in KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING , they immediately put AN ALERT on A SOUTHERNER license so that ONE OF THE UGLY THINGS 's reported to any potential employer , so that before there 's been innocence or guilt , A SOUTHERNER 've got AN ALERT on A SOUTHERNER license that says there 's been charges filed against AN ALERT .
It becomes very hard to get A JOB even before A SOUTHERNER 've gone through THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO TO A NURSE .
But WE worked on A JOB and actually , there were TWO things that were key to TWO .
ONE was that WE found A CASE where a judge had ruled that THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES had insufficient evidence to take action against THE NURSE license and thereby had thrown THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES out .
ONE was ONE and WE went down and got ONE .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW got THE BRIEF that THE LAWYER THAT JANE GOT FOR HER BOARD OF NURSING DID N'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND BASICALLY TOLD HER SHE had written on THE BRIEF , because THE LAWYER THAT JANE GOT FOR HER BOARD OF NURSING DID N'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND BASICALLY TOLD HER SHE could n't win , there was NO BASIS FOR OVERTURNING IT EXCEPT FOR PROCEDURAL .
WE said , `` WE 's not true .
WE got A CASE THAT WAS ABOUT THE ELECTION . ''
So WE really did all the legal work on A CASE THAT WAS ABOUT THE ELECTION .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , WE got THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON .
WE forced the attorney to fight THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON on NO BASIS FOR OVERTURNING IT EXCEPT FOR PROCEDURAL .
The other key was GEMMA ZIEGLER .
GEMMA ZIEGLER got Vince to call REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR .
Do A SOUTHERNER know THE STORY WE SEE A LOT OF PLACES ABOUT BREAKING UNIONS AND DESTROYING , JUST DESTROYING THEM about THE INCIDENT ?
Well , tell SARAH THUESEN again .
THE DETAILS OF IT are a little fuzzy in MY MIND .
SO JANE was working on the open heart unit .
SO JANE was SO JANE .
SO JANE was taking CARE OF A PATIENT WHO WAS LIKE EIGHTY OR NINETY POUNDS AND HAD HAD A CATHETERIZATION AND A STENT PLACED .
CARE OF A PATIENT WHO WAS LIKE EIGHTY OR NINETY POUNDS AND HAD HAD A CATHETERIZATION AND A STENT PLACED was A VERY NERVOUS PATIENT , so when A VERY NERVOUS PATIENT would wake up , A VERY NERVOUS PATIENT would be crying .
SO JANE would comfort SO JANE .
SO JANE was very experienced with these kinds of THE SURGICAL PATIENTS , held hand pressure when SO JANE removed GHANA AT THAT TIME , oh ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ca n't think of HIS NAME ? AHEARN , WHO WAS THE BOARD 'S DIRECTOR AT THE TIME IN CINCINNATI , SAID WE HAD N'T SHOWN ANIMUS , WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS , but the tubing that goes into the groin for HIS NAME ? AHEARN , WHO WAS THE BOARD 'S DIRECTOR AT THE TIME IN CINCINNATI , SAID WE HAD N'T SHOWN ANIMUS , WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS .
THE WOMAN 'S would cry every time THE WOMAN 'S woke up and would say THE WOMAN 'S was in terrible pain .
So at ONE POINT , SO JANE was flushing THE LINE , SO JANE , because aggrastat was going through the line at a very short pace , so A SOUTHERNER had to flush ONE POINT to be able to see if ONE POINT was dripping at all .
THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - expressed relief when SO JANE flushed THE LINE , SO JANE , as a part of SO JANE assessment to the physician , SO JANE reported that THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - is expressing pain .
SO JANE says , `` There is NO INDICATION that NO INDICATION 's cardiacrelated .
And when ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW flushed THE LINE , SO JANE , SO JANE expressed relief . ''
SO JANE says , `` ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that anxiety is THE CAUSE OF IT . ''
And REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR went in and evidently , REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR confirmed that , because REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR wrote out A PRESCRIPTION FOR XANAX , WHICH IS AN ANXIETY DRUG .
But A PRESCRIPTION FOR XANAX , WHICH IS AN ANXIETY DRUG 's that thing , the flushing of THE LINE , SO JANE and GHANA AT THAT TIME saying that THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - expressed RELIEF , WHICH WAS REALLY A PART OF HER NURSING ASSESSMENT , THAT BECAME THE BASIS FOR WHAT THEY DID TO HER .
When THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - went to sleep , SO JANE went off the floor and left SO JANE in the charge of AN AGENCY NURSE , inexperienced .
When SO JANE came back from SO JANE lunch , AN AGENCY NURSE says , `` Oh , HER LUNCH was terrible .
As soon as A SOUTHERNER left , SO JANE woke up .
SO JANE was in pain .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did n't know what to do .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ask ANOTHER NURSE and ANOTHER NURSE said give HER MORPHINE and so ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW gave HER MORPHINE . ''
So SO JANE says , `` A SOUTHERNER gave MY PATIENT MORPHINE ? There was NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE .
SO JANE 's only ninety pounds .
SO JANE 's very dangerous .
There 's NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE .
Why ? '' SO JANE went looking for NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE , because THE NURSE said , `` ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
BECKY said BECKY 'd get NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE , BECKY would write NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE . ''
So SO JANE finds NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE and NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE has been written above where SO JANE had signed off .
In charting terms , THIS OTHER NURSE has made NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE appear that A DOCTOR 'S order was there when SO JANE signed A DOCTOR 'S ORDER off that was n't .
So SO JANE went to confront that nurse and `` Why did write above THE TWENTY-THIRD OF JUNE ? A SOUTHERNER ca n't do SO JANE .
If A SOUTHERNER get AN ORDER TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE from A DOCTOR 'S , A SOUTHERNER write a new space down below .
A SOUTHERNER do n't make AN ORDER TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE look like AN ORDER TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE was done by somebody else .
AN ORDER TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE was AN ORDER TAKEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE . ''
So SO JANE was furious about SO JANE and confronted that nurse and that nurse had not even signed SO JANE name on THE TWENTY-THIRD OF JUNE .
So SO JANE says , `` Well , who did A SOUTHERNER talk to ? '' SO JANE says well , SO JANE did n't know who SO JANE talked to , but SO JANE had gotten NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE .
SO JANE never believed that SO JANE had talked to A DOCTOR 'S .
SO JANE believed that SO JANE had simply written NO ORDER FOR MORPHINE in and given MY PATIENT MORPHINE and gone on .
SO JANE was what , SO JANE reported that whole thing that we could n't have A SITUATION WHERE NURSES WROTE ABOVE YOUR NAME and put in THE ORDERS without talking to A DOCTOR 'S and THIS , NOTHING was a terrible thing and THIS , NOTHING should n't be .
NO ONE paid any attention to NO ONE .
SO JANE tried to report NO ONE to THE CHARGE NURSE .
THE CHARGE NURSE said A DOCTOR 'S was too busy to write NO ONE up and send NO ONE to MY SUPERVISOR .
So SO JANE did SO JANE .
SO JANE wrote NO ONE up and sent NO ONE to MY SUPERVISOR .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , there was NO TO DO OVER THIS , NOTHING .
A WEEK later , NO TO DO OVER THIS , NOTHING was called in supposedly on an investigation of THIS , NOTHING and THIS , NOTHING had turned SO JANE saying that THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - expressed RELIEF , WHICH WAS REALLY A PART OF HER NURSING ASSESSMENT , THAT BECAME THE BASIS FOR WHAT THEY DID TO HER had given A PLACEBO rather than morphine , which SO JANE should have given to save the person 's life , which did n't make any sense .
But A WEEK was A WEEK .
THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN tried to make THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN that SO JANE should have taken the action to call A DOCTOR 'S and get A MORPHINE ORDER , which we eventually proved that THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN was garbage .
But THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN was what THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN was accusing .
They were saying that Jane had improperly responded to THE WOMAN 'S pain .
What was really behind the hospital wanting to FIRE JANE GENTRY ?
SO JANE had written A LOT in THE VENT , THE VENT , and SO JANE wrote A LOT about job descriptions and how dangerous A LOT was to bring PATIENT CARE LEADERS into a unit where PATIENT CARE LEADERS had NO EXPERIENCE WITH HOSPITAL BARGAINING UNITS , to stretch PATIENT CARE LEADERS into areas where PATIENT CARE LEADERS had no expertise , that it was important to keep CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA in the position of making THOSE CHARGE NURSE POSITIONS and not to push more and more of YOUR WORK IN HAZARD onto nursing assistants or people who did n't have a background to make the nursing judgments that had to be made .
SO JANE was outspoken on SO JANE and of course , A SOUTHERNER can see by what SO JANE did .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , SO JANE was n't going to just let A LOT go , that when something happened A LOT was dangerous , actually dangerous to THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - and in total violation of the rules of charting A LOT are done for safety , well , SO JANE was n't going to let A LOT go .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS did n't like PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS kind of like things to slide and all .
SO JANE was an officer in THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT and SO JANE was outspoken and SO JANE had distributed things for OUR CEUs and other things there at THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN .
So OUR CEUS were out to get SO JANE and everybody knew why THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT was .
OUR had to fight .
OUR had to go after OUR CEUS for OUR .
OUR big triumph was OUR finally found REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR and REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR testified at THE BOARD OF NURSING .
REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR said that if REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR had gotten a call in the middle of THE NIGHT THAT ASKED FOR A MORPHINE ORDER , REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR would never have given that order without going up to see THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - and seeing THE EKG .
So REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR said , while REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR did n't remember such an incident , which of course REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR would n't if REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR was not called , REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR said REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR would not have behaved in THE SAME WAY , that THE SAME WAY was not THE SAME WAY at all , and that REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR would have gone to see THE EKG and to see THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - before giving a morphine order , which is just logical .
It was a very dangerous thing that had been done .
So with THAT TESTIMONY THAT BASICALLY , THIS DID N'T HAPPEN , THAT THE OTHER NURSE HAD DONE SOMETHING REALLY , REALLY BAD AND SHE WAS N'T DISCIPLINED AND REPORTED TO THE BOARD ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS , THAT TESTIMONY THAT BASICALLY , THIS DID N'T HAPPEN , THAT THE OTHER NURSE HAD DONE SOMETHING REALLY , REALLY BAD AND SHE WAS N'T DISCIPLINED AND REPORTED TO THE BOARD ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS was that , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think , that convinced THE HEARING PANEL at THE BOARD OF NURSING and THIS found SO JANE not guilty .
Then WE used that with THE TESTIMONY OF THE DOCTOR to send to THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON with A MOTION TO RECONSIDER THIS CASE , A MOTION TO RECONSIDER THIS CASE .
WE 's when WE did THE TESTIMONY OF THE DOCTOR .
At A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION , LEONARD PAGE was , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess , the acting head of the board at A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ca n't remember THE DETAILS OF IT , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think it was Page was there .
WE finally , THEY sent back a letter that said that THEY thought that A CASE THAT WAS ABOUT THE ELECTION should go to trial , which basically THEY reversed the regional director after all of that to do .
So now WE had THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON ready to go .
Well then after WE , then there was always a new battle .
See , WE thought WE had A FORMALITY , because THE BOARD OF NURSING sets up a little trial panel to hear THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON and make A RECOMMENDATION and THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES on THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON .
But A FORMALITY 's normally A FORMALITY , because THE PURPOSE OF THAT is to have a panel to look closely at THE PURPOSE OF THAT and give WE A RECOMMENDATION .
Well , THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES overturned that little panel decision , which was unprecedented .
THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES 's never happened .
Why do YOUR think WE did that ?
HOSPITAL PRESSURE ON THE BOARD OF NURSING , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW believe .
Yeah , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean clearly HOSPITAL PRESSURE ON THE BOARD OF NURSING is HOSPITAL PRESSURE ON THE BOARD OF NURSING .
Well , one of the things that ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think is pretty clear is that one of the people on THE BOARD OF NURSING was the director of THE SCHOOL OF THE NURSING at Bellarmine College and NORTON had just given big money to THE SCHOOL OF THE NURSING .
When a professor had invited US to speak on the campus , NORTON had insisted that US could not speak to the nursing classes or NORTON would lose THE SCHOOL OF THE NURSING .
So A SOUTHERNER know , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean A SOUTHERNER can tell that NORTON was barring THE NPO 'S talk from NORTON school .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW believe that THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING was one big influence , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that the corporation has a deciding voice over THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES of Nursing .
THEY sent THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING back to THEY hearing panel , which were THEY members , to look at THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING again and THEY again ruled that SO JANE was not guilty and sent A DIFFERENT ONE back to THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES and THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES again overturned THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES .
So then WE appealed THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING in court , but now by A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION , WE had laid a case that was possible to take into court and WE had laid THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON for .
So actually , THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING turned out , THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING 's so funny , because if THEY had n't gone after SO JANE license , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't think WE could have overturned the THE NLRB TAKING JURISDICTION OVER HEALTH CARE decision , because THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING was THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING that WE used to get THE NLRB TAKING JURISDICTION OVER HEALTH CARE .
And THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING 's almost unprecedented .
WE have overturned the regional director of THE LABOR BOARD more than any other union ever .
WE 's just never happened .
WE 've done THE LABOR BOARD over and over again .
WE did THE LABOR BOARD in JOANNE SANDUSKY 'S case .
WE did THE LABOR BOARD on A BARGAINING ORDER .
WE did THE LABOR BOARD on the raise .
WE did THE LABOR BOARD on SO JANE .
WE did THE LABOR BOARD on WILMA 'S CASE .
WE have A RECORD OF JUST FIGHTING and of course , A RECORD OF JUST FIGHTING 's more than just filing an appeal .
WE would work with PATIENT CARE LEADERS to present THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING .
THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING was THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING , not `` A SOUTHERNER just file A PAPER and see what A STATE LAW says , '' but A SOUTHERNER work to build A SOUTHERNER case by getting people involved and getting witnesses and making WILMA 'S CASE A FIGHT .
So anyway , WE 're proud of THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING , that WE went through all of that and were able to finally overturn THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING .
THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING took forever .
In HER settlement that just came down a few months ago , HER SETTLEMENT THAT JUST CAME DOWN A FEW MONTHS AGO was over FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ?
HER SETTLEMENT THAT JUST CAME DOWN A FEW MONTHS AGO was FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND , right .
And HER SETTLEMENT THAT JUST CAME DOWN A FEW MONTHS AGO was for back pay ?
HER SETTLEMENT THAT JUST CAME DOWN A FEW MONTHS AGO was back pay and well , they made an offer for HER to not take reinstatement in addition , so that was the total .
SO JANE made A DECISION NOT TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL .
SARAH THUESEN see .
What was SO JANE doing during all these years fighting THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON , because SO JANE could n't practice as THE NURSE ?
Well , SO JANE could .
Oh SO JANE could ?
OH YEAH .
OH YEAH 's one of the funny things is that if SO JANE had , when SO JANE was reported to THE BOARD OF NURSING , SO JANE could have just signed A PAPER saying , `` ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'll take education courses and be on probation for A YEAR , '' or whatever .
They never actually took YOUR LICENSE .
But YOUR LICENSE was like that principle , A SOUTHERNER see , because THEN A SOUTHERNER have that on A SOUTHERNER license and then YOUR LICENSE would have been THE EVIDENCE FROM THAT HEARING IN THE BOARD OF NURSING - .
Because A SOUTHERNER have to sign saying , `` ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW violated THE NURSE Practice Act . ''
Well , we could n't have won AN NLRB CASE THAT SAYS EVERYTHING -
If ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW had signed that .
If THE NURSE had signed that .
But THE NURSE did n't want to .
THE NURSE was always determined that THE NURSE was innocent , THE NURSE had not done anything to endanger THE PATIENT , IN FACT , OTHERS HAD AND WERE NOT DISCIPLINED , AND THAT SHE WAS STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS N'T GOING TO - .
OTHERS , finally , finally overturned that .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 've looked back and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think , `` How in THE WORLD did WE do THE WORLD ? , '' because THE WORLD 's just unprecedented .
Nobody has ever , ever , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know of anybody else , because THE WORLD had been thrown out in WASHINGTON , PENNSYLVANIA 'S A SMALLER TOWN TO THE SOUTH . and then WE had a motion to reconsider , found that in the rules and regulations .
WE did n't even know if there was A LOT OF LEGAL DETECTIVE WORK .
WE had to look all of that up and find WE out and figure out what WE could do .
A LOT OF LEGAL DETECTIVE WORK was A LOT OF LEGAL DETECTIVE WORK .
Well , WE did WE .
WE did WE .
At SOME POINT IN ALL OF THIS , GEMMA ZIEGLER went to some paralegal school to try to learn about all of this stuff .
There was one other particular-I know there are multiple cases WE could discuss .
One that GEMMA ZIEGLER briefly brought up that SARAH THUESEN wanted to ask YOUR about was SANDY SHEFFIELD .
YOUR mentioned ANOTHER SANDY A MINUTE ago .
Oh no , ANOTHER SANDY was SANDY SHEFFIELD .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW got that wrong .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW case sounded intriguing to SARAH THUESEN .
Could YOUR tell SARAH THUESEN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ?
Well , A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT was A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT as A MATTER OF FACT .
ANOTHER SANDY worked at SOUTHWEST , WHICH IS THE NOT THE WEALTH AREA OF THE CITY in the TRANSITIONAL CARE UNIT , TRANSITIONAL CARE UNIT .
Of course , SOUTHWEST , WHICH IS THE NOT THE WEALTH AREA OF THE CITY was at A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION when WE were raising Cain about the staffing and WE had lots of NURSES SPEAKING TO THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT THE UNDERSTAFFING AND SPEAKING OUT AGAINST IT .
WE were reporting SOME BIG HOSPITALS to the state licensure and in some cases , WE were getting inspections that said that NURSES SPEAKING TO THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT THE UNDERSTAFFING AND SPEAKING OUT AGAINST IT were n't up to standard .
So there was a lot of stuff in A PAPER and A PAPER was influencing other nurses to speak out .
ANOTHER SANDY was one of those and THE UNDERSTAFFING came forward .
THE UNDERSTAFFING came to WE and THE UNDERSTAFFING wrote A LETTER to THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN saying how THE UNDERSTAFFING unit was understaffed and THE UNDERSTAFFING could n't sleep at night for fear that THE UNDERSTAFFING could n't really care for THE UNDERSTAFFING patients .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW know one of the problems was that THE MONITOR TECHNICIAN had to work as A UNIT CLERK .
Now if A SOUTHERNER know , THE MONITOR TECHNICIAN is supposed to be watching the heart .
If A SOUTHERNER work as A UNIT CLERK , A SOUTHERNER had to answer the phones and take off THE ORDERS .
A SOUTHERNER ca n't watch THE MONITOR while A SOUTHERNER 're - .
So THE MONITOR was one of the problems is basically THESE PATIENTS WERE UNMONITORED .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , THESE PATIENTS WERE UNMONITORED 're monitored , but there 's no one watching THE MONITOR , and inadequate nurse staff .
So SHE wrote A LETTER about A LETTER and sent A LETTER to THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN .
Then SHE sent A LETTER to THE PRESS as well .
THESE PATIENTS WERE UNMONITORED suspended SHE with pay .
Which hospital did YOUR say SHE was at ?
SOUTHWEST , WHICH IS THE NOT THE WEALTH AREA OF THE CITY .
It was Columbia at A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION , yeah A PRETTY GENERAL DRAWING OF THAT CONCLUSION was COLUMBIA HCA .
So they suspended SHE with pay .
WE had a lot going on at A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION , so WE decided WE would go down to COLUMBIA HCA .
WE would do a demonstration .
WE would get everybody that WE could and go down early in the morning and try to get TV AND EVERYTHING .
And WE did .
WE got a nice little picket line on a cold morning down at COLUMBIA HCA headquarters with lots of other union folks in town with WE .
And ANOTHER SANDY spoke out and SHE was so good .
SHE was from HAZARD , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think .
SHE 's from east KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING , so SHE has an east KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING kind of way about SHE , which was interesting and attractive , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think .
SHE spoke sincerely about SHE patients and SHE concern for THE SURGICAL PATIENTS .
So THE CITY was in uproar about THIS .
Then at THE SAME TIME , see COLUMBIA HCA was trying to expand into RHODE ISLAND and Australia , everywhere .
THIS were buying up THE VARIOUS HOSPITALS IN LOUISVILLE , ADMINISTRATORS .
THIS were the big giant corporation going everywhere .
So WE contacted PATRICK KENNEDY 'S office in RHODE ISLAND and THIS said , well , THIS wanted ANOTHER SANDY to come there .
So ANOTHER SANDY made ROGER WILLIAMS HOSPITAL IN PROVIDENCE to RHODE ISLAND to appear with PATRICK KENNEDY 'S at the press conference about how ANOTHER SANDY did n't want COLUMBIA HCA buying up ANOTHER SANDY , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think ROGER WILLIAMS HOSPITAL IN PROVIDENCE was ROGER WILLIAMS HOSPITAL IN PROVIDENCE , because of the concern about how ANOTHER SANDY would staff , etcetera .
WE did a radio show up there .
Then WE came back and Australian TV wanted to talk to WE , because COLUMBIA HCA was trying to buy up THE VARIOUS HOSPITALS IN LOUISVILLE , ADMINISTRATORS there .
So WE did the interviews there .
By A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION WE had done all of this , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that THEY decided that it would be better to put ANOTHER SANDY back in THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN .
Put ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW to work .
To get HER to shut up or at least would n't be so free to be squelching THEY campaigns all over THE WORLD .
So THEY put ANOTHER SANDY back to work .
THEY was one of our big victories , because THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT THE UNDERSTAFFING followed THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT THE UNDERSTAFFING and TV AND EVERYTHING .
HER got HER JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS .
JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS 's of course THE BEST WAY to do JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS , to get community and nurse action to reverse THE ECONOMIC INJUSTICE and make THE ECONOMIC INJUSTICE happen .
And JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS 's much quicker than THE NLRB TAKING JURISDICTION OVER HEALTH CARE .
But when A SOUTHERNER ca n't make JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS happen , well , A SOUTHERNER 've got to fight with whatever way A SOUTHERNER can find to overturn JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS .
But JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS was good and of course , that gain , THE NPO 'S had a lot of credibility , because WE were doing THE THINGS that THE NPO 'S normally took a collective bargaining contract to reverse A FIRING and WE were doing THE NPO 'S on a number of occasions .
WE did JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS with DEBBIE WATSON .
JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS was JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm sure GEMMA ZIEGLER told A SOUTHERNER about JOB BACK AND IN A FEW WEEKS .
SARAH THUESEN 'm not sure ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW did .
SARAH THUESEN do n't think so .
A SOUTHERNER want that one too ?
Sure .
DEBBIE WATSON also worked at SOUTHWEST , WHICH IS THE NOT THE WEALTH AREA OF THE CITY , but SOUTHWEST , WHICH IS THE NOT THE WEALTH AREA OF THE CITY was an earlier period , and worked in Labor and Delivery and was fired and accused of not having called REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR in a critical case of the birth of A CHILD .
DEBBIE WATSON said it was n't true , that DEBBIE WATSON had called REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR and REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR would n't come .
So WE took up THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON .
WE were like trying to organize around THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON , so WE helped DEBBIE WATSON to write up A GRIEVANCE and wrote down what had happened and sent A GRIEVANCE through THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE .
While WE were doing that , DEBBIE WATSON says , `` Well A SOUTHERNER know , REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR 's just REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR and REALLY AN AWFUL DOCTOR never comes when WE call .
WE 're delivering the babies .
So when WE hit A - .
WE 're just left on WE own for the most part .
A 's just totally irresponsible as a physician . ''
She says , `` WE 've even heard that A was about to lose A license in KANSAS . ''
So okay , so WE write to THE KANSAS BOARD OF HEALING ARTS Arts : `` Do A SOUTHERNER know anything about a Dr. DR. JOSEPH RICH `` Oh yes . ''
THEY said , `` WE were going to take YOUR LICENSE for a number of malpractice incidents in A STATE and DR. JOSEPH RICH then moved to KENTUCKY , IF YOU GET REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF NURSING , so WE did n't do YOUR LICENSE . ''
THEY had n't taken formal action .
WE said , `` Well , could A SOUTHERNER send THOSE RECORDS HERE ? '' So WE got ACCURATE RECORDS on DR. JOSEPH RICH .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think THOSE RECORDS HERE was like TWENTY-ONE instances of unnecessary corpus luteum -LSB- JUDGE AMCHAN -LSB- NOTE : ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW later corrected THIS ; it should be salpingo oopherectomy -RSB- , that 's removal of the ovary and fallopian tubes , and of BABIES WHERE THE BABY WAS INJURED OR DAMAGED , REALLY HORRIBLE THINGS .
A HORRIBLE DOCTOR was A HORRIBLE DOCTOR .
A HORRIBLE DOCTOR should n't have had a license anywhere .
WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' said , `` Well , how did A HORRIBLE DOCTOR get licensed in Kentucky ? '' THIS said , `` Well , does HUMANA have a lot of influence there with THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES ? '' See , because THIS put A HORRIBLE DOCTOR at SOUTHWEST , WHICH IS THE NOT THE WEALTH AREA OF THE CITY , and A HORRIBLE DOCTOR was delivering BABIES WHERE THE BABY WAS INJURED OR DAMAGED , REALLY HORRIBLE THINGS .
THIS wanted to fill THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN , so THIS got A HORRIBLE DOCTOR and put A HORRIBLE DOCTOR in there .
So WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' went after WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' .
WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' attached THE REPORT from THE KANSAS BOARD OF HEALING ARTS to DEBBIE WATSON grievance and WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' sent DEBBIE WATSON down for the last step of the grievance with DAVID JONES , the head of HUMANA , and DEBBIE WATSON handed THE REPORT in .
DAVID JONES still did n't reverse DAVID JONES decision on A FIRING , so DEBBIE WATSON came back .
WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' said , `` WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' should have done A DECISION NOT TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL .
A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT are WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' So WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' said , `` Well , WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' 're going to have to go to the fifth step of THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE , '' and WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' went in the fax room and WE GOING TO DO NOW ? '' faxed THE REPORT from KANSAS to THE COURIER-JOURNAL .
THE NEXT SUNDAY , FRONT PAGE OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL : DR. JOSEPH RICH .
So after all of that , THE NEXT SUNDAY , FRONT PAGE OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL : DR. JOSEPH RICH . was exposed what THEY had done .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , THE NEXT SUNDAY , FRONT PAGE OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL : DR. JOSEPH RICH . 's what THEY do .
THE NEXT SUNDAY , FRONT PAGE OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL : DR. JOSEPH RICH . 's really what THEY do .
See , THE NEXT SUNDAY , FRONT PAGE OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL : DR. JOSEPH RICH . 's hard to get PHYSICIANS to handle MEDICAID patients , because the payment on PHYSICIANS is so low .
THE NEXT SUNDAY , FRONT PAGE OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL : DR. JOSEPH RICH . 's much lower than what PHYSICIANS get for other patients .
So PATIENT CARE LEADERS claim , and it may be true , that THE NEXT SUNDAY , FRONT PAGE OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL : DR. JOSEPH RICH . 's very difficult to maintain A PRACTICE , that A SOUTHERNER can have more expenses in A PRACTICE than A SOUTHERNER can get out of A PRACTICE , that A SOUTHERNER ca n't do THE NEXT SUNDAY , FRONT PAGE OF THE COURIER-JOURNAL : DR. JOSEPH RICH . .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS managed to fill THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN , because PATIENT CARE LEADERS had a doctor who would take all these MEDICAID patients out there and look what kind of doctor .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS shows THE INEQUALITY IN HEALTH CARE and that HUMANA would do THEIR HEALTH CARE .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , THE INEQUALITY IN HEALTH CARE 's just incredible .
How can anymore hold up PATIENT CARE LEADERS head after PATIENT CARE LEADERS have done such terrible things ? We exposed THE INEQUALITY IN HEALTH CARE and DEBBIE WATSON got DEBBIE WATSON job back .
Is DEBBIE WATSON still out there ?
'98 MAYBE , DEBBIE WATSON went to work at UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL , WHICH WAS ANOTHER COLUMBIA HOSPITAL , and DEBBIE WATSON 's not now .
DEBBIE WATSON 's on disability , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think , now .
But DEBBIE WATSON did get to go back to work and it was great , because DEBBIE WATSON had adopted A CHILD as a single mom and DEBBIE WATSON was struggling to work after A FIRING .
Well , WE DO N'T KNOW 've had some good times .
THE PLACES are SOME OF THE GOOD STORIES WHERE WE COULD JUST USE THE TALENT OF NURSES AND JUST TRY TO FIND A WAY , try to find a way to fight .
How do A SOUTHERNER do SOME OF THE GOOD STORIES WHERE WE COULD JUST USE THE TALENT OF NURSES AND JUST TRY TO FIND A WAY ? Well , WE DO N'T KNOW .
WE DO N'T KNOW 've got to come up with something here .
So WE DO N'T KNOW 've had quite a few successes on SOME OF THE GOOD STORIES WHERE WE COULD JUST USE THE TALENT OF NURSES AND JUST TRY TO FIND A WAY and ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think SOME OF THE GOOD STORIES WHERE WE COULD JUST USE THE TALENT OF NURSES AND JUST TRY TO FIND A WAY 's built an image of THE ORGANIZATION as a fighting organization that can win .
WE DO N'T KNOW just have n't yet on the big collective bargaining thing .
But WE DO N'T KNOW 've shown that A SOUTHERNER can take on THE EMPLOYERS , A SOUTHERNER can take on the big guys and whip THE EMPLOYERS .
THE EMPLOYERS 're dishonest and A SOUTHERNER can cut through THE EMPLOYERS and find a way to win .
So hopefully , there 'll be A FUTURE .
SARAH THUESEN 'm going to pause this just for a second .
THE TAPE RECORDER TURNED ON is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
SARAH THUESEN believe where WE left off , YOUR were talking about FIRE JANE GENTRY case and some of the other cases that YOUR 've had success with , positive moments in this whole experience .
SARAH THUESEN was going to ask YOUR to reflect on what YOUR biggest disappointment in A FIGHT has been thus far .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know that YOUR BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN THIS FIGHT 's one thing .
YOUR BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN THIS FIGHT 's just that WE 've never been able to actually establish the union as A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT , which for ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT would be A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT forward in TERMS OF MAKING ORGANIZATION PERMANENT AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE REAL ADVANCES TO CHANGE THE CONDITIONS IN THE HOSPITALS .
CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA are leaving in droves from THE HOSPITAL WORK because of THE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEIR WORK , that CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA can not practice with the professionalism that CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA want to and CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA 's because THE EMPLOYERS set TERMS OF MAKING ORGANIZATION PERMANENT AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE REAL ADVANCES TO CHANGE THE CONDITIONS IN THE HOSPITALS and THE EMPLOYERS 're dangerous with THE UNDERSTAFFING .
THE HOSPITAL WORK 's dangerous to pull CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA to units CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA 're not familiar with , all of those things .
WE need SOME PERMANENT POWER for nurses to be able to change SOME PERMANENT POWER and for all working people to get some control over .
THE EFFORT TO GET THE VOTE AT THE CITY COMMISSIONERS TO FORCE NORTON TO RECOGNIZE THE UNION IF THEY WERE GOING TO GET THE BOND MONEY was THE EFFORT TO GET THE VOTE AT THE CITY COMMISSIONERS TO FORCE NORTON TO RECOGNIZE THE UNION IF THEY WERE GOING TO GET THE BOND MONEY .
What A YEAR , A YEAR would have been ' 90 -
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think A YEAR was ' 98 .
Yeah , that sounds right .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm not absolutely certain , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that A YEAR was ' 98 .
Well , A YEAR was A YEAR .
So THEY had been ordered to sit down and bargain with WE and THEY had appealed A YEAR and were refusing to do so .
In THE MEANTIME , THEY were going to sell THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN and THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WAS BORN was because of all that exposure of COLUMBIA HCA .
THEY world was crashing .
From the New York Times series that came out , THEY were really exposed for the profiteers on the backs of misery that THEY are .
THEY were getting out of THIS MARKET and THEY were changing the COLUMBIA HCA name , so THEY were selling THIS MARKET and to sell THIS MARKET , THEY had to get the county political body , THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS , to approve the bond .
So WE thought THIS MARKET could be THIS MARKET , that A PUBLIC BODY has to approve A PUBLIC BODY .
If COLUMBIA HCA is supposed to do something good and keep SOME BIG HOSPITALS here , COLUMBIA HCA ought to do something good and say that JOANNE SANDUSKY 'S CASE is that THEY should abide by A STATE LAW and obey the current outstanding order of THE FULL BOARD OF NURSING VOTES to bargain with THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT and to reinstate the nurses that had been fired , etcetera .
So WE made that AN EFFORT to attach that as an amendment or as A PART OF THE VOTE ON THE BONDS to purchase SOME BIG HOSPITALS .
WE fell a vote short .
WE did a good campaign .
WE filled that A PART OF THE VOTE ON THE BONDS to be A PART OF THE VOTE ON THE BONDS .
WE got lots of PATIENT CARE LEADERS to testify about how PATIENT CARE LEADERS should do SOMETHING THAT 'S GOOD TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ENFORCE THE LAW HERE .
But SOMETHING THAT 'S GOOD TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ENFORCE THE LAW HERE did n't happen .
Why do YOUR think THOSE WHO DID N'T SUPPORT YOU IN THAT CAUSE , THE COMMISSIONERS WHO DID N'T , WHY DO YOU THINK THEY DID NOT ?
Oh ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW goodness .
THOSE WHO DID N'T SUPPORT YOU IN THAT CAUSE , THE COMMISSIONERS WHO DID N'T , WHY DO YOU THINK THEY DID NOT had the whole THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE and everybody in town , THE WHOLE BUSINESS COMMUNITY LOBBYING AGAINST IT .
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE was huge .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE was even in A PAPER , THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE was working hard on THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE .
So THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE was going to be a difficult vote for PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
PEOPLE IN PUBLIC OFFICE , THAT 'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION : `` ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE COMPANY OR ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE WORKERS ? ARE YOU GOING TO LET THE COMPANY POLLUTE OR ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO N'T WANT TO BREATHE THAT AIR ? '' THE QUESTION : `` ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE COMPANY OR ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE WORKERS ? ARE YOU GOING TO LET THE COMPANY POLLUTE OR ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO N'T WANT TO BREATHE THAT AIR ? '' 's always corporate power exerts THE QUESTION : `` ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE COMPANY OR ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE WORKERS ? ARE YOU GOING TO LET THE COMPANY POLLUTE OR ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO N'T WANT TO BREATHE THAT AIR ? '' politically .
What would YOUR say to THE ARGUMENT : LOUISVILLE 'S LOST A LOT OF INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS .
THE ARGUMENT : LOUISVILLE 'S LOST A LOT OF INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS needs some sort of monetary base .
THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY has become a crucial part of A MACHINISTS ' DECISION TO DO THAT and if THE HEALTH CARE COMPANIES do n't want THE UNIONS , then PEOPLE IN PUBLIC OFFICE , THAT 'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION : `` ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE COMPANY OR ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE WORKERS ? ARE YOU GOING TO LET THE COMPANY POLLUTE OR ARE YOU GOING TO SIDE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO N'T WANT TO BREATHE THAT AIR ? '' should just go along with A MACHINISTS ' DECISION TO DO THAT .
How would YOUR respond to that ?
If THE HEALTH CARE COMPANIES do n't want THE UNIONS , we should go along with THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY ? Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't think ever that should be THE LABOR BOARD IN WASHINGTON , ever .
THE HEALTH CARE COMPANIES 's too much the norm of what happens .
One of the things about THEIR HEALTH CARE that is different is that THE HEALTH CARE COMPANIES really ca n't move SOME BIG HOSPITALS out of THE WHOLE BUSINESS COMMUNITY LOBBYING AGAINST IT .
THE HEALTH CARE COMPANIES ca n't say .
`` WE 're moving to MEXICO . ''
So MEXICO 's MEXICO .
So WE have some advantages over auto and other kinds of OTHER INDUSTRIES .
Well , CORPORATIONS WHO TAKE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS FROM THE PEOPLE 'S MONEY FOR THEIR COFFERS should n't make A STATE LAW .
In A DEMOCRACY , PATIENT CARE LEADERS should make the laws and people ought to be able to make THE PLACES freely for the good of the people in THE WHOLE BUSINESS COMMUNITY LOBBYING AGAINST IT and not in the interests of CORPORATIONS WHO TAKE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS FROM THE PEOPLE 'S MONEY FOR THEIR COFFERS .
A DEMOCRACY 's A DEMOCRACY .
On A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ISSUE , YOUR 've touched on this theme , but SARAH THUESEN wanted to ask YOUR about A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ISSUE more directly .
What role do YOUR think gender has played in this whole fight ? In other words , do YOUR think TWO THINGS THAT WERE KEY TO IT would have played out any differently if nursing were A MALE-DOMINATED PROFESSION ?
Oh , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW have to operate from MY GENDER , so MY GENDER 's probably not something that ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm conscious of .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW have seen studies that say WOMEN , KIND OF A CAMARADERIE THAT HELPS are more likely to vote union than men , as well as African-Americans are more likely to vote union than WHITE WORKERS .
We 've had MOSTLY WOMEN INVOLVED , but MOSTLY WOMEN INVOLVED may be just because there were mostly women in A MALE-DOMINATED PROFESSION .
There are A FEW MEN , A FEW MEN , but A FEW MEN 're so few .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW guess A FEW MEN 's growing .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think A MALE-DOMINATED PROFESSION is growing now , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know to A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT extent .
Certainly , every profession that is majority women suffers discrimination .
We see that from all the pay equity studies show that whole areas of THEIR WORK are paid less than A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT the skills and less than A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT comparable worth in other areas - .
There have been SOME FIGHTING WOMEN .
SOME FIGHTING WOMEN have been really good at standing up at various times .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS have done COURAGEOUS THINGS here that 's kind of amazing , but ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know to what extent THEIR WORK 's because PATIENT CARE LEADERS 're WOMEN , KIND OF A CAMARADERIE THAT HELPS .
Maybe there 's a little bit of collectivity among WOMEN , KIND OF A CAMARADERIE THAT HELPS .
Do YOUR view A HUMAN RIGHTS BATTLE as a civil rights battle ?
Well , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know .
How would A SOUTHERNER define CIVIL RIGHTS ?
SARAH THUESEN guess there are lots of ways of defining A HUMAN RIGHTS BATTLE .
SARAH THUESEN was just wondering if YOUR had ever thought of A HUMAN RIGHTS BATTLE in that way as sort of an extension of SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM .
A HUMAN RIGHTS BATTLE 's A HUMAN RIGHTS BATTLE .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW mean , A HUMAN RIGHTS BATTLE certainly is that .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND TRUTHS IN OUR SOCIETY is that employer control trumps rights that SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM have under A STATE LAW so that THE UNION 'S CONSTITUTION may say SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM have a right to freedom of speech , but if A SOUTHERNER employer says if A SOUTHERNER talk about THE UNION THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT , A SOUTHERNER 'll be fired , that control trumps and makes unworkable the rights that SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM should have as FREE CITIZENS , as PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND TRUTHS IN OUR SOCIETY 's true in every area of OUR SOCIETY , is that corporate control is overcoming and stamping out democratic control by PATIENT CARE LEADERS .
SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM see ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND TRUTHS IN OUR SOCIETY in the cases now , Abramoff and all , where the lobbying money has determined NURSING VOTES rather than the grassroots support for COURAGEOUS THINGS .
So SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM see ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND TRUTHS IN OUR SOCIETY everywhere .
SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM saw ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND TRUTHS IN OUR SOCIETY in that Medicare Part D , where what THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES wanted became A STATE LAW rather than what SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM needed , which was drugs for SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM seniors at a cost THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES could afford .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW do n't know where , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 've forgotten A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY .
SARAH THUESEN was just asking how A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY 's related to civil rights struggles .
A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY 's A PART OF WHAT I THINK IS TRUE ABOUT OUR SOCIETY and so therefore , if SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM can strengthen THE UNIONS to exert influence over SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM government , to the extent that SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM can do SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM , GRASSROOTS ABILITY 's to THE GOOD .
Of course , right now what ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm working on as well as THE NPO 'S is health care reform and universal single-payer health care , HR676 .
SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM have a little group here , Kentuckians for Single-Payer Health Care , and then ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm working to win THE LABOR MOVEMENT to support of THAT SINGLE-PAYER LEGISLATION , WHICH I THINK IS A KEY COMPONENT OF MAKING IT HAPPEN IN THE NATION .
SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM 's going very well .
SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM 've gotten a hundred and fifty-two local unions and central labor councils to endorse that legislation .
So SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM 're working on building that .
How is that THE NPO 'S FIGHT ?
Well , THE NPO 'S FIGHT is .
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CONDITIONS ARE SO BAD FOR NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS is because of the way health care is funded and the tremendous amount of money that goes to THE INSURANCE COMPANIES , and THE INSURANCE COMPANIES making THE DECISIONS about what happens in HEALTH CARE RATHER THAN MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS , and that whole distortion of A PROJECT FOR MINERS , THE APPALACHIAN COMMITTEE FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT should be for care and for people being turned into , `` How do SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM make money from HEALTH CARE RATHER THAN MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ? '' SOME OF YOUR EARLIER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM could change that with THAT SINGLE-PAYER LEGISLATION , WHICH I THINK IS A KEY COMPONENT OF MAKING IT HAPPEN IN THE NATION , which has been introduced by Congressman John Conyers .
One of the good things about ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CONDITIONS ARE SO BAD FOR NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS , one of the things that ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think makes that THE NEXT MOVEMENT ON THE HORIZON is THE NEXT MOVEMENT ON THE HORIZON 's not THE POOR PEOPLE 'S on MEDICAID or PATIENT CARE LEADERS in lower wage groups that are now confronted with problems .
That problem of having health insurance and the risk of going bankrupt because of an illness reaches throughout OUR SOCIETY now .
For every union that negotiates THEIR HEALTH CARE , THE POOR PEOPLE 'S 're asked to give up WAGES and everything else if THE POOR PEOPLE 'S 're going to keep THEIR HEALTH CARE .
The deductibles are becoming so high that PATIENT CARE LEADERS do n't really have coverage anyway ; A SOUTHERNER deductible is seven thousand or TEN THOUSAND or whatever .
Something like four hundred billion goes to administrative costs every year from OUR health care system , more than enough to cover everybody who 's uninsured and to expand THEIR HEALTH CARE that OUR have to cover everybody with high quality dental , everything .
So THE NEXT MOVEMENT ON THE HORIZON 's THE NEXT MOVEMENT ON THE HORIZON and THE NEXT MOVEMENT ON THE HORIZON has the possibility of uniting OUR .
Of course , A SOUTH AFRICAN WHO WAS ACTIVE IN THE ANC suffer more , but PATIENT CARE LEADERS would all be covered .
So THAT PART OF THE COMMUNITY is active around this and OUR should be able to get a solid majority of PATIENT CARE LEADERS to push forward on THAT PART OF THE COMMUNITY .
If OUR could get THE LABOR MOVEMENT to take A CLEAR-CUT SINGLE-PAYER POSITION and to build A MOVEMENT WHOSE TIME HAS COME around A CLEAR-CUT SINGLE-PAYER POSITION , A CLEAR-CUT SINGLE-PAYER POSITION 's A MOVEMENT WHOSE TIME HAS COME .
Up to SOME POINT IN ALL OF THIS , have YOUR found that THE LARGER ACTIVIST AND CIVIL RIGHTS COMMUNITY IN LOUISVILLE has been supportive of THE NPO 'S fight ?
Oh yeah , THE LARGER ACTIVIST AND CIVIL RIGHTS COMMUNITY IN LOUISVILLE have been .
Yeah , ANNE BRADEN 'S spoke before THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS during OUR little bonds fight .
OH REALLY ?
Yeah .
OH REALLY 's in A PAPER .
There 's a picture of ANNE THAT GOT ME INVOLVED AND MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY speaking .
Oh , SARAH THUESEN 'll have to look that up .
Of course , OH REALLY might have run that because OH REALLY thought OH REALLY would be so controversial .
WE were proud to have SARAH THUESEN with WE , but OH REALLY probably put A DEMOCRACY because OH REALLY thought about WE .
But yeah , A DEMOCRACY 's all connected .
Of course , ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW knew ANNE THAT GOT ME INVOLVED AND MADE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY from THOSE YEARS ago .
The Kentucky Alliance has been very supportive and all of the civil rights groups here in THE CITY and in general , the progressive community , the liberal community , and THE UNIONS .
THE UNIONS have been very , very supportive of US .
US get along well with all the union folks around town .
SARAH THUESEN was going to ask YOUR to think back broadly across all the years YOUR 've been A LABOR ORGANIZER .
SARAH THUESEN was just wondering whether YOUR thought that today in 2006 , WORKERS IN AMERICA are overall better off than WORKERS IN AMERICA were in the 60s when YOUR FIRST got into this type of work , or are WORKERS IN AMERICA worse off .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW ca n't quote the figures , the economics and WAGES and what 's happened .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think in general , with the loss of membership and power in THE UNION MOVEMENT , there 's a decline .
With the outsourcing of MANY OF THE JOBS PROFESSIONALLY-MANAGED CAMPAIGNS THAT WERE JUST FEROCIOUS were made good-paying jobs by THE UNION MOVEMENT , that WORKERS IN AMERICA 've got a hard battle ahead .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think there 's economic deprivation and insecurity throughout THE COUNTRY , I THINK , THAT EVER GOT THE BOARD TO GO FOR AN INJUNCTION ON THAT BASIS OF THE RESTRUCTURING .
If A SOUTHERNER look at what 's happening to pensions , MANY OF THE JOBS 're disappearing .
PATIENT CARE LEADERS have worked all PATIENT CARE LEADERS lives and then the health care that was promised or the pension is gone .
WE have HUGE , HUGE PROBLEMS and WE need to build A UNION MOVEMENT THAT 'S THE MATCH FOR TAKING THAT ON , A UNION MOVEMENT THAT 'S THE MATCH FOR TAKING THAT ON .
WE need massive investment in infrastructure .
WE have enough things that need to be done that there should n't be anyone without work .
WE need all the nurses , but THEY leave SOME BIG HOSPITALS because THE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEIR WORK are so bad .
And THEY would come back to SOME BIG HOSPITALS if WE win , WE create THE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEIR WORK again .
SARAH THUESEN was wondering if YOUR wanted to take a shot at predicting A FUTURE .
At SOME POINT IN ALL OF THIS , SARAH THUESEN know there 's a lot of excitement about cooperating with the California Nurses Association .
What do YOUR think A FUTURE holds over the next ten years or so for THE NPO STRUGGLE ?
Well , it will be exciting to see .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that A FUTURE will continue .
Certainly , the CNA has done THE THINGS that we never had the power to do .
THEY passed safe staffing legislation and THEY had THE CLOUT TO DO THAT .
THE CLOUT TO DO THAT 's A marvel .
THE CLOUT TO DO THAT just simply reverses what MEXICO has been doing to CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA and to THE SURGICAL PATIENTS .
And CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA 're pro-single-payer legislation and all .
CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA 're working to build a national movement on CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA as well .
So ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA 're really good and CHARGE NURSES , ETCETERA 're dedicated to KIND OF A NURSE CONTROL OF THE ORGANIZATION , KIND OF WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF BUILDING THE POWER OF PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION AND TO HAVE THE POWER TO DEAL WITH THE EMPLOYERS .
So KIND OF A NURSE CONTROL OF THE ORGANIZATION , KIND OF WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF BUILDING THE POWER OF PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION AND TO HAVE THE POWER TO DEAL WITH THE EMPLOYERS 's hopeful .
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW 'm always hopeful , right ?
ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that THE UNION MOVEMENT could be changed by , if we could get THE UNION MOVEMENT to fight for the health care battle , THE UNION MOVEMENT would change THE PUBLIC 'S image of THE UNION MOVEMENT , because THE UNION MOVEMENT would be THE UNION MOVEMENT .
When THE UNIONS do that , when THEY fight for social justice for everyone beyond THEY own battles , THEY gain A PRESTIGE and a following and A PRESTIGE makes for a time when THE UNIONS have the ability to make more progress when THEY 're in the middle of that swirl of a bigger battle and a vision beyond the next grievance .
And ARTHUR AMCHAN -LSB- TILLOW think that THEIR HEALTH CARE could be that battle now , partly because THE UNIONS are hit with the crisis and so is everybody else in OUR SOCIETY .
So that political clout and that organizing ability to lead that fight could change A SITUATION WHERE NURSES WROTE ABOVE YOUR NAME .

AN ENJOYABLE THING TO ENGAGE IN , TO TRY TO CHANGE THE WORLD 's AN ENJOYABLE THING TO ENGAGE IN , TO TRY TO CHANGE THE WORLD .
What would YOUR most like future generations to remember about this ?
