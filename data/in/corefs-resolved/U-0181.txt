Today SARAH THUESEN am at THE HOME OF GEMMA ZIEGLER IN LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .
SARAH THUESEN is SARAH THUESEN and today is the twenty-second of June , 2006 .
SARAH THUESEN 'm conducting this interview for the Southern Oral History Program .
Thanks so much for sitting down to talk with SARAH THUESEN today .
Well , SLAVES TO US 're welcome .
SARAH THUESEN thought we 'd FIRST just talk a little bit about YOUR background .
SARAH THUESEN 'm interested to hear A LITTLE BIT more about how YOUR came to nursing and where YOUR grew up .
YOUR 're from LOUISVILLE originally , right ?
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm from LOUISVILLE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was born in LOUISVILLE and was raised maybe less than MAYBE FIVE OF THEM miles from THE WORST PART .
OH REALLY ?
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't go very far .
Have YOUR lived in Louisville YOUR whole life ?
Yes .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've never gone away from home .
And YOUR were born in ' 46 , was 46 ?
Yes .
So YOUR have a good perspective on the recent history of THE CITY THEN ?
Oh yeah , OH GEMMA , GEMMA sure do .
What did YOUR parents do ?
MY FATHER was MY FATHER and MY MOTHER was MY MOTHER and MY MOTHER assisted MY FATHER in MY FATHER business .
MY MOTHER worked like THREE DAYS a week at MY FATHER office .
THREE DAYS was just OH GEMMA , GEMMA and MY SISTER , and MY SISTER lives about a mile from OH GEMMA , GEMMA right now .
Oh , nice .
Yeah , we 're very close .
And MY MOM has Alzheimer 'S .
YOUR PARENTS are divorced now and MY MOTHER has Alzheimer 's and MY FATHER has Parkinson 's disease .
But YOUR PARENTS 're both alive in YOUR PARENTS eighties .
-LSB- Phone ringing -RSB- -LSB- Recorder is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
SARAH THUESEN 'm curious , when YOUR were growing up here in LOUISVILLE , did YOUR know any folks who were in THE UNIONS ?
OH GEMMA , GEMMA dad hated THE UNIONS .
LOUISVILLE 's interesting .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA dad during World War II worked at Reynold 's Metals and there was A UNION there and MY DAD DURING WORLD WAR II was very supportive of THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
But then when MY DAD DURING WORLD WAR II went into MY DAD DURING WORLD WAR II own business , MY DAD DURING WORLD WAR II hated THE UNIONS .
Then OH GEMMA , GEMMA had AN UNCLE WHO WAS AN ELECTRICIAN WHO I THINK MUST HAVE - .
YOUR uncle was ?
Yeah , AN UNCLE WHO WAS AN ELECTRICIAN WHO I THINK MUST HAVE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA remember talk about THE UNIONS and like `` THEN OF COURSE , HEARING ABOUT JIMMY HOFFA GROWING UP , '' THEN OF COURSE , HEARING ABOUT JIMMY HOFFA GROWING UP .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA really had a negative , either a non-opinion or A SOMEWHAT NEGATIVE OPINION .
But then once OH GEMMA , GEMMA grew up and OH GEMMA , GEMMA married , OH GEMMA , GEMMA FIRST husband was in the Carpenters Union , which was a very good union .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA had a positive perspective at THAT POINT .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA never really , to be quite honest , during THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and all that , OH GEMMA , GEMMA was supportive of THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA was busy having MY CHILDREN and living YOUR WHOLE LIFE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was not A DEMONSTRATING TYPE OF PERSON .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA waited and saved all A DEMONSTRATING TYPE OF PERSON until OH GEMMA , GEMMA got older .
But SLAVES TO US know , OH GEMMA , GEMMA just , OUR family , OH GEMMA , GEMMA friends , OUR were against the VIETNAM WAR , but OUR were very docile .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was raised CATHOLIC .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think SLAVES TO US are likely to do as SLAVES TO US 're told and respect authority and OH GEMMA , GEMMA did .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA FIRST husband had a horrible temper and MY FIRST HUSBAND was n't physically abusive , but very verbally abusive .
So at ONE POINT WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE SMALL , OH GEMMA , GEMMA went to see A COUNSELOR and ONE POINT WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE SMALL was A WOMAN COUNSELOR .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA had wanted A COUNSELOR to go with OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
A COUNSELOR would n't go , so OH GEMMA , GEMMA went by OH GEMMA , GEMMA and we did n't have a lot of money .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA told A WOMAN COUNSELOR what was going on and A WOMAN COUNSELOR said , `` SLAVES TO US need to find a profession .
Will A COUNSELOR object to A COUNSELOR Because OH GEMMA , GEMMA only had a high school education at THAT TIME and OH GEMMA , GEMMA think OH GEMMA , GEMMA was like about , oh twenty-four or twenty-six , something like THAT TIME .
A WOMAN COUNSELOR said , `` SLAVES TO US need to go back to school and get SLAVES TO US a degree to raise MY CHILDREN , because A COUNSELOR sounds like A DEMONSTRATING TYPE OF PERSON , A COUNSELOR 's not going to pay child support and SLAVES TO US could have A WHOLE OTHER STORY .
SLAVES TO US need to set some goals . ''
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA did .
THAT NIGHT OH GEMMA , GEMMA went home and thought about THAT NIGHT and THE NEXT DAY , OH GEMMA , GEMMA called the community college here and went back to school .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband had MY FIRST HUSBAND own business , A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS , but THE MONEY did n't matter .
A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS was A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS .
MY FIRST HUSBAND was MY FIRST HUSBAND .
MY FIRST HUSBAND just had A WHOLE OTHER STORY .
Anyway , A WHOLE OTHER STORY 's A WHOLE OTHER STORY .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA was taking MY CORE CLASSES and sat next to A WOMAN WHO WAS IN A NURSING PROGRAM .
A WOMAN WHO WAS IN A NURSING PROGRAM said , `` SLAVES TO US should go into nursing . ''
A WOMAN WHO WAS IN A NURSING PROGRAM said , `` A NURSING PROGRAM 's A NURSING PROGRAM . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` OH GOD , OH GEMMA , GEMMA would n't - . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA asked A WOMAN WHO WAS IN A NURSING PROGRAM what were MY CORE CLASSES .
A WOMAN WHO WAS IN A NURSING PROGRAM said , `` Chemistry . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA went , `` OH GOD , OH GEMMA , GEMMA would never pass chemistry . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA made good grades in high school .
Grade school and high school , OH GEMMA , GEMMA was always OH GEMMA , GEMMA , but for some reason , OH GEMMA , GEMMA had a very negative feeling that OH GEMMA , GEMMA could n't do math or OH GEMMA , GEMMA could n't do chemistry .
JUST THE SOUND OF GEOMETRY AND CHEMISTRY JUST LIKE FREAKED ME OUT .
She said , `` SLAVES TO US really should try JUST THE SOUND OF GEOMETRY AND CHEMISTRY JUST LIKE FREAKED ME OUT . .
SLAVES TO US really should try JUST THE SOUND OF GEOMETRY AND CHEMISTRY JUST LIKE FREAKED ME OUT . . ''
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA applied and was accepted .
Out of like six hundred applications , they only took , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think , A HUNDRED and twelve and OH GEMMA , GEMMA got in .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA figured it was meant to be .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA passed chemistry with flying colors and geometry and all the other things OH GEMMA , GEMMA had to take , and pharmacology , and got out of NURSING SCHOOL .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved NURSING SCHOOL .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved NURSING SCHOOL .
Where did YOUR do those courses ?
Jefferson Community College and then OH GEMMA , GEMMA had an AD in NURSING .
And of COURSE HAVING CHILDREN , being around SICK KIDS , SLAVES TO US learn A LOT just from having MY CHILDREN .
So nursing seemed very natural to OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
Anyway , OH GEMMA , GEMMA had told OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband when OH GEMMA , GEMMA started school , and COURSE HAVING CHILDREN took OH GEMMA , GEMMA like SIX YEARS , six or eight years to get through A TWO-YEAR PROGRAM , because OH GEMMA , GEMMA lived out in Oldham County , which is right out of JEFFERSON COUNTY .
COURSE HAVING CHILDREN is like a suburb of JEFFERSON COUNTY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA actually lived in Peewee Valley and OH GEMMA , GEMMA had to commute between there to school .
MY SON 'S was like four .
MY DAUGHTER was in school .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA had to do daycare with MY SON 'S , pick MY DAUGHTER up from school .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband would not help OH GEMMA , GEMMA at all .
If MY FIRST HUSBAND had to watch MY CHILDREN , MY FIRST HUSBAND called it babysitting .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA was THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY , so THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY took OH GEMMA , GEMMA quite awhile to get through school .
THE LAST TWO YEARS , OH GEMMA , GEMMA carpooled with another nurse who lived out THAT WAY .
THE LAST TWO YEARS made THE LAST TWO YEARS A LITTLE BIT easier and WE 'd watch EACH OTHER 'S children when WE had classes that were different .
Anyway , when OH GEMMA , GEMMA started school , OH GEMMA , GEMMA told him , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` If THINGS have n't changed when OH GEMMA , GEMMA graduate , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm leaving . ''
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA did .
THINGS did n't change .
What year would that have been ?
1975 was 1975 .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think OH GEMMA , GEMMA was twenty-nine .
So then OH GEMMA , GEMMA started work and initially , OH GEMMA , GEMMA was making like four dollars and seventy-five cents .
Now OH GEMMA , GEMMA just graduated from NURSING SCHOOL .
THEY were putting OH GEMMA , GEMMA on THE ELEVEN-TO-SEVEN SHIFT .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was going to be charge nurse and THEY said THEY were going to give OH GEMMA , GEMMA SIX WEEKS BEFORE THIS training on THE FLOOR .
So after TWO WEEKS , THEY put OH GEMMA , GEMMA to the night shift and THE FIRST NIGHT , OH GEMMA , GEMMA had a supervisor with OH GEMMA , GEMMA and the second night OH GEMMA , GEMMA show up and no one 's with OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm like , -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
There were TWO LPNS , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA was still in charge .
WE had like forty-eight patients .
WE had MAYBE TWO aides .
But back then , OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean WE did everything on THE FLOOR .
It was supposed to be A CATARACT UNIT .
A CATARACT UNIT 's when TWO AIDES used to put CATARACT PATIENTS in THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US .
WE had GI bleeds .
WE had PEOPLE WITH LUNG CANCER .
WE had everything .
So anyway , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said SOMETHING AND THEY go , `` Oh , SLAVES TO US can do LUNG CANCER . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA learned later on that SOMETHING AND THEY 's what PEOPLE WITH LUNG CANCER do .
PEOPLE WITH LUNG CANCER put young people in and PEOPLE WITH LUNG CANCER go , `` Oh , SLAVES TO US can do LUNG CANCER .
Do n't worry about LUNG CANCER . ''
And PEOPLE WITH LUNG CANCER put SLAVES TO US in A POSITION that SLAVES TO US 're risking someone 's life , plus SLAVES TO US license , plus SLAVES TO US psyche .
If anything were to happen , how could SLAVES TO US live with SLAVES TO US ? OH GEMMA , GEMMA really was just out of school .
So anyway , OH GEMMA , GEMMA did PEOPLE WITH LUNG CANCER , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA was making like four seventy-five an hour .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA thought , `` This is great . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA chose to work ELEVEN O'CLOCK to ABOUT SEVEN , because OH GEMMA , GEMMA aunt-I could have gone THREE TO ELEVEN-I had AN AUNT WHO WAS ABOUT SIXTY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA moved to AN APARTMENT , let OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband have THE HOUSE , because MY FIRST HUSBAND ran a business out of OUR home .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA took SICK KIDS and MY CAR and SICK KIDS beds and moved .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA aunt lived in the apartment right behind OUR .
OUR walls were connected and OH GEMMA , GEMMA put in an intercom system .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA daughter at THE TIME WHEN WE WERE IN THE FIGHT was , OH GEMMA , GEMMA guess , around TWELVE and MY SON 'S was ABOUT SEVEN .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA would put THEM to bed and then OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'd knock MY DAUGHTER AT THE TIME on MY DAUGHTER AT THE TIME door and tell MY DAUGHTER AT THE TIME , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm leaving for work . ''
MY DAUGHTER AT THE TIME would turn on the intercom and MY DAUGHTER AT THE TIME would listen for THEM and then MY DAUGHTER AT THE TIME 'd go over in THE MORNING and get THEM up and get THEM breakfasts .
Then OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'd get home after and then OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'd sleep during THE NEXT DAY and be HER HOME .
THE NEXT DAY was crazy .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA hated that shift .
But THE NEXT DAY 's what OH GEMMA , GEMMA had to do .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA could n't afford A SITTER and OH GEMMA , GEMMA aunt did THE NEXT DAY for free .
A SITTER 's still living .
A SITTER 's ninety-six .
So anyway , A SITTER was wonderful .
What hospital were YOUR at during this period ?
Initially , it was called ST. JOSEPH 'S .
ST. JOSEPH 'S was what NORTON AUDUBON was .
NORTON AUDUBON 's gone through numerous changes .
NORTON AUDUBON was at Eastern Parkway , but now NORTON AUDUBON has moved .
NORTON AUDUBON moved in 1980 .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA was working there probably about two months when THEY gave US a quarter raise .
Then OH GEMMA , GEMMA guess about MAYBE TWO , THREE TO ELEVEN-I more months , US got a dollar-an-hour raise .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said to HER OTHER ONE , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` Do THEY give raises like this all the time ? '' OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't believe OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm making THIS MUCH MONEY , '' which HER OTHER ONE was nothing and it was n't anything what VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES are worth , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't know .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was just so tickled to be doing something that OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved and actually getting paid for HER OTHER ONE .
SHE goes , `` OH NO , there 's a union trying to get in . ''
SHE says , `` OH NO 'll do anything to keep THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES out . ''
So THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES 's THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
And THIS was about what year ?
THIS was the first year OH GEMMA , GEMMA was out , ' 75 , ' 76 .
Okay , THIS was still ' 75 , ' 76 .
' 75 , ' 76 .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA worked there and stayed on THE ELEVEN-TO-SEVEN SHIFT .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA worked there about A YEAR and OH GEMMA , GEMMA met OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband .
Then WE got married in ' 79 .
Did MY FIRST HUSBAND work at THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US ?
MY FIRST HUSBAND was MY FIRST HUSBAND .
PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S , PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S did n't become MY FIRST HUSBAND until after WE were married .
PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S became THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US in '79 TO ' 80 .
PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S was PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S to NORTON AUDUBON .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've got A FUNNY STORY about THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA quit THE FLOOR about six months before we got married and then OH GEMMA , GEMMA worked just in THE POOL , in THE RECOVERY .
Oh , OH GEMMA , GEMMA waited until YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE moved to NORTON AUDUBON and as soon as YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE moved to NORTON AUDUBON , OH GEMMA , GEMMA started working in THE POOL and in THE RECOVERY ROOM .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA told YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA will work just in THE RECOVERY ROOM . ''
YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE would call OH GEMMA , GEMMA like NINE O'CLOCK in THE MORNING and say , `` Somebody did n't show up .
Can YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'd go in .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved THE RECOVERY ROOM .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA worked there about THREE MORE MONTHS and YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE started doing this to OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE 'd call OH GEMMA , GEMMA at like TEN THIRTY , ELEVEN O'CLOCK and say , `` WE need SLAVES TO US to come in to THE RECOVERY ROOM . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA get to THE RECOVERY ROOM and YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE go , `` Oh , WE do n't need SLAVES TO US here .
WE need SLAVES TO US up on one of the floors . ''
No orientation to THE FLOOR .
YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE put OH GEMMA , GEMMA on THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK MEDS and CATARACT PATIENTS had n't had CATARACT PATIENTS morning meds .
THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK MEDS 's ABOUT SEVEN .
YOU COME IN ? '' `` SURE wanted OH GEMMA , GEMMA to give THE MORNING THEIR MORNING MEDS and give THEIR MORNING MEDS for , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK MEDS was THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK MEDS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA did THE MORNING one time and OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` If SLAVES TO US all are going to do this , OH GEMMA , GEMMA will not come back .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA am not going to risk YOUR LICENSE , '' and dealing with insulin and OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm not used to YOUR LICENSE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't deal with YOUR LICENSE when OH GEMMA , GEMMA worked at ST. JOE 'S , did n't deal with YOUR LICENSE in THE RECOVERY room on a regular basis .
And ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS were seriously ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS and OH GEMMA , GEMMA just would n't do YOUR LICENSE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband said , `` SLAVES TO US do n't have to work . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was working because OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved doing YOUR LICENSE .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband was on THE MEDICAL STAFF and MY FIRST HUSBAND was going to all the meetings and stuff .
And THE HUMANA GOLD bought ST. JOE 'S .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband had a run-in with WENDELL CHERRY , WHO WAS ONE OF THE OWNERS OF HUMANA , ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF HUMANA .
THE HUMANA GOLD , OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know if SLAVES TO US know , was founded in LOUISVILLE .
DAVID JONES used to work for John Y. Brown at Kentucky Fried Chicken .
Oh , okay .
DAVID JONES turned THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US into kind of a Kentucky Fried Chicken .
So anyway , OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband was at THESE MEETINGS and MY FIRST HUSBAND found out that THE HOSPITALS were having A MEETING , all the administrators , on how to fight THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
There was A NURSING MOVEMENT GOING ON .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA had heard about A NURSING MOVEMENT GOING ON .
Of course , OH GEMMA , GEMMA told SLAVES TO US when OH GEMMA , GEMMA started , they said a union movement .
But with getting married and moving and MY CHILDREN and working , OH GEMMA , GEMMA was just totally oblivious .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA read THE PAPER ABOUT IT , but there was n't anything in THE PAPER ABOUT IT .
THE PAPER ABOUT IT was just THE PAPER ABOUT IT .
Do YOUR know WIN ?
WIN was WIN , We 're Involved in NURSING .
The leader of WIN and the founder of WIN was CAROL KING .
CAROL 'S is now deceased .
CAROL 'S died at fifty-four , wonderful , energetic , just bright smile , personality , plus CAROL 'S was married to an attorney .
CAROL 'S worked at `` OUR LADY OF PEACE and CAROL 'S started that movement .
But CAROL 'S had decided that CAROL 'S had gone with THE KENTUCKY NURSING ASSOCIATION .
CAROL 'S had A BSN and A BSN was A BSN and A BSN 's where CAROL 'S led everybody .
THE UNION MOVEMENT AT THAT TIME WITH NURSES was at `` OUR LADY OF PEACE , St. Mary 's , which is now Caritas , and there was ANOTHER ONE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was raised CATHOLIC , CAROL 'S was raised CATHOLIC , and WE were just stunned later on when WE talked about CATHOLIC by how HOSPITALS reacted to THE UNIONS .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES were VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know SO MUCH OF MYSELF about that union except for several nurses lost THEIR JOBS BACK and SO MUCH OF MYSELF was in the courts for THE LAST TWO YEARS .
And by THE TIME IT GOT THROUGH , THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP were long gone .
But CAROL 'S was in THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP movement .
THAT FIRST NURSES ' MOVEMENT was WIN .
THAT FIRST NURSES ' MOVEMENT was actually like about ' 75 , ' 76 .
but then when CAROL 'S started ANOTHER ONE , ONE was like in '79 TO ' 80 and CAROL 'S was just kind of pulling ONE together .
CAROL 'S was wanting to go with another union .
CAROL 'S was just starting back over to revive THE UNION MOVEMENT AT THAT TIME WITH NURSES .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband told OH GEMMA , GEMMA that THE ADMINISTRATORS were all having A MEETING to fight THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES , to work together on busting THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
A MEETING made OH GEMMA , GEMMA so mad .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA called CAROL 'S and OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA just want to let SLAVES TO US know this is what 's going on . ''
CAROL 'S invited OH GEMMA , GEMMA to A UNION MEETING .
In fact , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A UNION MEETING was that EVENING at CAROL 'S house .
And as luck had A UNION MEETING , CAROL 'S lived only a half A MILE from OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA went to A UNION MEETING and met VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES and OH GEMMA , GEMMA have n't seen VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES for awhile , but LEE KAISER , Susie Martin , a very strong woman , outspoken .
LEE KAISER is a male nurse , one of the few male nurses .
And CAROL 'S ca n't think of some of THE OTHER ONES ' NAMES .
But WE were in HER HOME and when OH GEMMA , GEMMA got ready to leave , CAROL 'S asked OH GEMMA , GEMMA if OH GEMMA , GEMMA would help CAROL 'S organize .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` Well , OH GEMMA , GEMMA have no idea what to do . ''
CAROL 'S said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't either , '' but CAROL 'S said , `` WE 're just trying .
WE 're just trying to do WE best . ''
So the FIRST assignment OH GEMMA , GEMMA had-at that THE TIME IT GOT THROUGH , CAROL 'S had MAYBE TWO little boys and ONE was ONE , and CAROL 'S other one was , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think , about seven-we were going to go LEAFLET BAPTIST HOSPITAL .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'd never done anything like THIS IN MY LIFE .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA helped CAROL 'S do the leaflets and CAROL 'S called .
CAROL 'S said , `` NOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO FIRST , '' SHE SAID , `` BECAUSE THE FIRST THING THAT 'LL HAPPEN IS YOU stand out there leafleting and THIS IN MY LIFE 're going to call the police on SLAVES TO US and try to scare SLAVES TO US and say SLAVES TO US 're on public property . ''
CAROL 'S grew up in ST. MATTHEWS .
CAROL 'S called the mayor of ST. MATTHEWS and found out where the property line , where public access was on , OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't think of THE NAME OF THE ROAD , WHERE BAPTIST HOSPITAL IS .
CAROL 'S found out how MANY FEET from THE CENTER LINE .
WE took WE measuring tape and WE stood there .
Well , WE were leafleting and talking to THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP as THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP 're getting off THE ELEVEN-TO-SEVEN SHIFT with WE kids .
WE kids are holding up signs .
WE 're talking to VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES as VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES 're coming out and VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES sent out the security to chase WE away .
This is where OH GEMMA , GEMMA learned OH GEMMA , GEMMA guts from CAROL 'S , because OH GEMMA , GEMMA was such a chicken .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA thought , `` Oh shit , let 'S get to MY CAR . ''
'S goes , `` No , JUST STAY RIGHT HERE . ''
JUST STAY RIGHT HERE said , `` MA'AM , SLAVES TO US 're going to have to leave . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm like , `` Okay , '' and getting ready to pack up .
MA'AM goes , `` WE are on public property and SLAVES TO US have no right to make WE leave .
WE have every right to be here . ''
`` Well ma'am , THE ADMINISTRATOR - . ''
MA'AM said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't care . ''
And WE looked , SLAVES TO US could see THE ADMINISTRATORS and all the people standing up at the window looking out at this guy chasing WE away and WE would n't leave .
So anyway , WE stayed until WE did WE job and then WE left and OUR JOB was so , what do OH GEMMA , GEMMA want to say ? OUR JOB was enlightening for one thing , but so empowering to think , SLAVES TO US know , OH GEMMA , GEMMA would have just walked away .
CAROL 'S was pretty incredible .
CAROL 'S and FIRE KAY are two of the strongest women that OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've known through all of this and knowledgeable and smart .
And CAROL 'S was just fun .
Through all of this , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've had such A GREAT TIME .
WE 've had some hard times , but most of A GREAT TIME 's been exciting .
So anyway , OH GEMMA , GEMMA was working with CAROL 'S and WE were organizing `` OUR LADY OF PEACE , WE 's where CAROL 'S worked part-time , LEAFLET BAPTIST HOSPITAL , and there was ONE OTHER ONE .
Maybe LEAFLET BAPTIST HOSPITAL was NORTON AUDUBON .
LEAFLET BAPTIST HOSPITAL was NORTON AUDUBON .
And WE were doing really well , really well , and then all of a sudden , THE RECESSION came .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES , A LOT OF THEM , THEIR SPOUSES worked at Ford .
INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER , INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER worked there and that closed , that shut down .
QUITE A FEW OF OUR BIG PLANTS shut down and THE PEOPLE were afraid .
QUITE A FEW OF OUR BIG PLANTS needed THIS MUCH MONEY .
THIS MUCH MONEY just kind of fizzled out .
WE were talking to unions to find out who to affiliate with .
WE wanted control , but WE wanted to affiliate with a big union .
Well , WE met with THE TEAMSTERS and WE were invited to AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . , to Philadelphia up to 1199 .
The funny thing is FIRE KAY and MY FIRST HUSBAND were at 1199 , but WE never met FIRE KAY .
So WE went to 1199 , but WE end up going with Tom Woodward .
What is that union ? Is n't that awful ? FIRE KAY will know .
1199 was 1199 , because FIRE KAY had a lot of HOSPITALS .
FIRE KAY had some hospitals in the South and FIRE KAY had organized HOSPITALS before .
WE were going GREAT GUNS and WE were having HOUSE MEETINGS .
WE 'd call up VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES .
WE meetings were full .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES wanted to organize .
But then when THIS came , THE RECESSION came , was that ' 81 ?
Yeah .
THIS was just like THIS fizzled , totally fizzled .
THE PEOPLE were just terrified and THE HOSPITALS knew THIS .
THE PEOPLE were threatening THE PEOPLE that THE PEOPLE would lose THE PEOPLE jobs .
TOM was TOM and TOM had another guy working for TOM .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think TOM has since died maybe .
TOM was TOM .
And TOM was based here in LOUISVILLE ?
PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S , they were out of Virginia maybe .
FIRE KAY would know .
FIRE KAY worked with TOM .
When she worked for 1199 .
Yeah .
And YOUR organization at THAT POINT , was that still WIN ?
Yeah , YOUR ORGANIZATION AT THAT POINT was still WIN . CAROL 'S used to get really frustrated because SO MANY NURSES were afraid to come to THESE MEETINGS .
WE were going really well and WE had a lot of cards signed , but there were still some that were just afraid and would n't stand up to management .
CAROL 'S said , `` WE just need to organize CATARACT PATIENTS .
WE just need to get A PATIENTS UNION . ''
So anyway , WE just kind of stepped back .
Then about 1989-I forgot how OH GEMMA , GEMMA was even going to start A PATIENTS UNION .
Did OH GEMMA , GEMMA get A CALL ? OH GEMMA , GEMMA got A CALL .
-LSB- pause -RSB- Let 'S see , THIS is in ' 89 .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think OH GEMMA , GEMMA got A CALL from someone and asked OH GEMMA , GEMMA to help THIS to organize .
Who was that ? Is n't that awful ? A CALL .
A NURSE , AN AIDE , A PATIENT called OH GEMMA , GEMMA and said , `` THINGS are horrible .
Will SLAVES TO US help us organize ? '' A CALL might have been SOFFIA .
SOFFIA was SOFFIA .
SARAH THUESEN 've seen SOFFIA name in a couple of -
Yeah , SARAH THUESEN 's SARAH THUESEN .
Clippings about the origins of THE GROUP .
SOFFIA .
Do YOUR remember SOFFIA last name ?
ATHERTON , but now HER LAST NAME 's - .
ATHERTON 's OUR LIVES .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA have ATHERTON phone number out there .
ATHERTON 's remarried and OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember ATHERTON new name .
Okay , yeah .
ATHERTON might be A GOOD ONE for SARAH THUESEN to talk to .
ATHERTON 's SARAH THUESEN .
Oh , ATHERTON was something .
ATHERTON was ATHERTON and ATHERTON was our main soldier .
ATHERTON was all over THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US .
ATHERTON had THE UNION CARDS UNDER HER CLIPBOARD for ATHERTON IVs .
Oh , ATHERTON had a ball .
ATHERTON got a lot of THE PEOPLE to sign THE UNION CARDS UNDER HER CLIPBOARD .
So anyway , OH GEMMA , GEMMA call CAROL 'S said , `` CAROL 'S , OH GEMMA , GEMMA got A CALL and THE PEOPLE want us to help THE PEOPLE organize . ''
CAROL 'S said , `` Well , are SLAVES TO US up to A CALL again ? '' OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` Yeah , let 'S give A CALL a try . ''
ONE OF THE DOCTORS AT THE HOSPITAL , ca n't think of HIS name either .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA can see HIS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband knows MY FIRST HUSBAND name and OH GEMMA , GEMMA can get MY FIRST HUSBAND to think of ONE OF THE DOCTORS AT THE HOSPITAL .
Anyway -
ONE OF THE DOCTORS AT THE HOSPITAL 's okay .
MY FIRST HUSBAND called THE COURIER-JOURNAL and told them that WE were going to have A UNION MEETING .
What WE said , `` WE 'll get-call maybe TEN , TWELVE HOURS A DAY or FIFTEEN of the old nurses , and WE 'll meet at one of the hotels in one of their little conference rooms and see what WE can bat around and see what direction WE were going . ''
So THIS DOCTOR calls a reporter and said THIS DOCTOR heard VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES were going to have A UNION MEETING .
Well , JOE WARD , called HER HOME .
JOE WARD asked OH GEMMA , GEMMA about HER HOME and OH GEMMA , GEMMA told JOE WARD that THE MAIN THING was awful and that there were SERIOUS PATIENT ISSUES and a lot of SERIOUS PATIENT ISSUES and that WE were going to have A UNION MEETING .
Well , JOE WARD writes HER HOME and puts HER HOME in the paper THE NEXT DAY before WE meeting .
WE were going to have three meetings and WE figured , seriously , maybe ten persons at A MEETING .
THE REASON WE ENDED UP HAVING THREE was because WE started getting calls that EVENING : `` SO-AND-SO 'S COMING and SO-AND-SO 'S COMING , but SO-AND-SO 'S COMING AND SO-AND-SO 'S COMING ca n't make THE REASON WE ENDED UP HAVING THREE at A GREAT TIME , '' so WE went ahead and set THE REASON WE ENDED UP HAVING THREE up for , WE ended up having to open up to a huge room .
WE had like three hundred people show up to the evening meeting .
At the morning meeting , WE had SIXTY people .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES were angry .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES were fed up .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES wanted THE TEAMSTERS .
ONE nurse said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA want somebody to slit administration 's tires . ''
When SLAVES TO US look at ONE , VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES were wanting somebody to do the dirty work .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES just wanted ONE solved and VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES wanted somebody else to do ONE for VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES .
From THE VERY BEGINNING , WE go , `` SLAVES TO US have to do THIS FOR THEMSELVES SLAVES TO US .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES have to do THIS FOR THEMSELVES . ''
Was THIS FOR THEMSELVES , WE told VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES could come .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think KENTUCKY NURSES , ANYBODY was in A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD .
Have SLAVES TO US seen A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD ? OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD was in A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD that WE were inviting THE UNIONS to come to talk to THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP .
A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD shows OH GEMMA , GEMMA and CAROL KING sitting together .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't think OH GEMMA , GEMMA have A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't think OH GEMMA , GEMMA saved any of A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD .
SARAH THUESEN 'll see if SARAH THUESEN can track that down .
Okay , A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD 's A COURIER-JOURNAL ARTICLE , JOE WARD .
So anyway , THE MACHINISTS came and spoke , THE TEAMSTERS , 1199 , THE KENTUCKY NURSING ASSOCIATION , and THE KNA WOMAN , OH GEMMA , GEMMA felt sorry for THE KNA WOMAN .
THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP shouted THE KNA WOMAN down : `` SLAVES TO US all have never done anything for us .
SLAVES TO US 're on THE SIDE OF MANAGEMENT . ''
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES , THE SIDE OF MANAGEMENT was like a wrestling match where THE PEOPLE yell out THINGS .
Could YOUR describe for SARAH THUESEN just in general what the frustrations were ? What were people angry about at THAT POINT ?
THE MAIN THING
THE MAIN THING was THE MAIN THING .
NO RESPECT FOR YOUR LIFE OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL , MAKING YOU STAY OVERTIME , CALLING YOU IN ON YOUR DAY OFF , PULLING , NO RESPECT FOR YOUR LIFE OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL , MAKING YOU STAY OVERTIME , CALLING YOU IN ON YOUR DAY OFF , PULLING .
A BIG ISSUE was A BIG ISSUE .
SLAVES TO US 're working SLAVES TO US unit and THEY pull SLAVES TO US to another unit SLAVES TO US 've never worked before .
And THEY tell SLAVES TO US if SLAVES TO US do n't go , SLAVES TO US get sent home and SLAVES TO US 'll be written up .
THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK MEDS was about THE MONEY , but THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK MEDS really was n't about THE MONEY .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES never said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA want MORE MONEY , '' and OH GEMMA , GEMMA think MORE MONEY 's partly MORE MONEY .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES did n't really respect VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES enough to say , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA deserve a better pay . ''
But VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES did want respect for VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES profession and respect for VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES as THE PEOPLE .
THEIR MAIN CONCERNS were always with CATARACT PATIENTS .
THE MAIN THING was THE MAIN THING .
Then the other things , like THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS pulling and WHATEVER , even though WHATEVER threatened YOUR LICENSE , THEIR MAIN FEAR was hurting someone , the dangers .
THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS was THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS and THEIR MAIN FEAR and the frustration .
So anyway , WE had THIS HUGE NURSING MOVEMENT and WE were not prepared .
So WE handed THE UNION CARDS UNDER HER CLIPBOARD .
WE had planned on handing out THE UNION CARDS UNDER HER CLIPBOARD .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think WE ran out of THE UNION CARDS UNDER HER CLIPBOARD .
WE just asked UNION PEOPLE best benefit .
THE TEAMSTERS came out like TEN , TWELVE HOURS A DAY cards over THE MACHINISTS .
THE MACHINISTS were all pretty close .
WE also said , `` Any nurse who wants to participate in pulling this together and helping WE organize , meet at CAROL 'S house tomorrow morning for breakfast . ''
So WE did WE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , WE did n't know THESE OTHER NURSES from Adam .
WE had like FIFTEEN nurses .
And WE came from all different hospitals ?
Yeah , all DIFFERENT HOSPITALS , all different disciplines , all different degrees of nursing .
WE had TWO LPNS and TWO LPNS 's one of the things different that WE did .
WE included TWO LPNS , because THE KENTUCKY NURSING ASSOCIATION would not allow TWO LPNS in .
Even the RNs said , `` SLAVES TO US know , TWO LPNS work side by side , but TWO LPNS do THE EXACT SAME THING , '' except hang blood and at THAT TIME , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think , do IV , PUSH DRUGS .
And at that initial FIRST big meeting , THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS was THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS - .
Well , SARAH THUESEN should back up and say THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS was THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS at most of the main hospitals in LOUISVILLE ?
Very few black VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES .
At THAT TIME ?
MMM
SHIRLEY KING , who is AFRICAN-AMERICAN and SHIRLEY KING was at CAROL 'S house , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm pretty sure SHIRLEY KING was there .
THREE DAYS were just like one big blur .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA hardly got any sleep .
THREE DAYS 's like SOMEBODY PUTTING FAST FORWARD ON .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , THREE DAYS just happened so fast .
THREE DAYS was just like being stunned .
PAT HARDY , who 's name later on changed and then OH GEMMA , GEMMA think SOMEBODY PUTTING FAST FORWARD ON changed THREE DAYS back , SOMEBODY PUTTING FAST FORWARD ON was there and SOMEBODY PUTTING FAST FORWARD ON had just come off an eleven-to-seven and came to CAROL 'S meeting at THE HOUSE .
By THAT TIME , at the end of A UNION MEETING , some of US stayed and even though THE TEAMSTERS came out ahead , US were just afraid that most nurses would think , `` TEAMSTERS , oh gee , truck drivers . ''
THE MACHINISTS were right behind THE MACHINISTS . ''
So US invited THE MACHINISTS to A UNION MEETING and US told THE MACHINISTS that US wanted to REMAIN-OH I KNOW , US were trying to come up with a name for US organization and PAT HARDY came up , `` NURSES PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION , NPO , '' because when a patient 's in THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US , THE MACHINISTS ca n't have anything by mouth , so there are stickers all over the hospital on CATARACT PATIENTS .
THE MACHINISTS means `` Nothing by mouth . ''
And REMAIN-OH I KNOW says , `` US 're tired of THE MACHINISTS pushing THE MACHINISTS agendas down US throats , '' so US named THE MACHINISTS NURSES PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION , NPO .
REMAIN-OH I KNOW did THAT ON HARDLY ANY SLEEP , CAME UP WITH THAT ACRONYM FOR US .
And US figured THAT ON HARDLY ANY SLEEP , CAME UP WITH THAT ACRONYM FOR US would keep US nursing organization and THIS HUGE NURSING MOVEMENT on THE PEOPLE minds when THE PEOPLE see THAT ON HARDLY ANY SLEEP , CAME UP WITH THAT ACRONYM FOR US all day long .
So anyway , THE MACHINISTS promised US that THE MACHINISTS would bring in professional organizers to help US , assist US in organizing .
The local people here were wonderful .
THE LOCAL MACHINISTS ?
MMM hmm . BUTCH HINTON was incredible .
BUTCH HINTON 's now deceased .
There were a couple of THE LOCAL MACHINISTS , though , that undermined US .
But BUTCH HINTON , BUTCH HINTON was BUTCH HINTON .
There was RON HARSH .
RON HARSH had another local , so RON HARSH did n't do SO MUCH OF MYSELF with US , but BUTCH HINTON was THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY .
BUTCH was BUTCH .
BUTCH was very wise .
BUTCH felt BUTCH did n't have THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE THIS SIZE MOVEMENT , so BUTCH called in their international .
And to be quite honest , THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE THIS SIZE MOVEMENT would have been better if BUTCH handled THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE THIS SIZE MOVEMENT , because BUTCH was BUTCH .
BUTCH was easy to work with .
BUTCH listened .
THEY sent down WARREN MART .
THEY sent SOME OTHER GUY in .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've tried to forget HER NEW NAME .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember right now .
HER NEW NAME 's WARREN MART ?
Uh huh .
THEY sent ANOTHER GUY IN WHO , I THINK , HAD AN ASSIGNMENT IN HAWAII and THEY pulled ANOTHER GUY IN WHO , I THINK , HAD AN ASSIGNMENT IN HAWAII off that to come to LOUISVILLE , LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY and OH GEMMA , GEMMA think ANOTHER GUY IN WHO , I THINK , HAD AN ASSIGNMENT IN HAWAII was not happy .
THEY split ME AND CAROL up and then THEY called in FIRE KAY .
CAROL 'S was the best thing that happened with that whole THE MACHINISTS thing .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA knew immediately CAROL 'S knew what CAROL 'S was doing and CAROL 'S related really well with all the nurses .
THE PEOPLE could n't believe CAROL 'S was n't CAROL 'S .
FIRE KAY will remember HIS name , but FIRE KAY put this other guy who was supposed to be in HAWAII , FIRE KAY put HIS with CAROL KING and another person to organize `` OUR LADY OF PEACE .
FIRE KAY put OH GEMMA , GEMMA with FIRE KAY to organize NORTON AUDUBON .
And FIRE KAY put EACH OTHER 'S , OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't think of HIS name , HIS has gray hair , FIRE KAY will know , to organize SUBURBAN .
FIRE KAY was n't long .
FIRE KAY were so busy .
We just worked , seriously , from CAROL 'S HOUSE TOMORROW MORNING to THE FIRST NIGHT .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband hardly ever saw OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll tell SLAVES TO US how bad CAROL 'S HOUSE TOMORROW MORNING was .
MY MOM had cataract surgery and OH GEMMA , GEMMA had to pick MY MOM up from the eye doctor and take MY MOM home .
MY MOM had asked OH GEMMA , GEMMA to drop MY MOM by THE GROCERY STORE and OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` `` SURE . ''
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA was anxious to get back , because we had all this stuff going on .
MY SON 'S called OH GEMMA , GEMMA in the meantime and said , `` Mom , OH GEMMA , GEMMA need MY CAR THE AFTERNOON . ''
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA told MY MOM , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` SLAVES TO US wait here .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm going to pick up BEAU . ''
Well , OH GEMMA , GEMMA got home and started talking to BEAU and OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` SLAVES TO US know , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've got A MEETING tonight .
Why do n't SLAVES TO US just drop OH GEMMA , GEMMA off at HIS OFFICE and SLAVES TO US take MY CAR and then FIRE KAY can bring OH GEMMA , GEMMA home tonight ? , '' totally forgetting MY MOTHER .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA left MY MOTHER at THE GROCERY STORE .
So MY MOTHER Think .
Did SLAVES TO US forget anything ? '' OH GEMMA , GEMMA go , `` No . ''
MY SON 'S says , `` Does THE WORD GRANDMA MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU ? '' But THE WORD GRANDMA MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU 's THE WORD GRANDMA MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU .
THE WORD GRANDMA MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU was just craziness .
WE just were working so hard on WE campaign .
And THE FIRST ELECTION CAMPAIGN was THE FIRST ELECTION CAMPAIGN ?
THE FIRST ELECTION CAMPAIGN was THE FIRST ELECTION CAMPAIGN .
WE were going GREAT GUNS .
WE had committees in EACH UNIT .
WE had TEAM LEADERS , CO-TEAM LEADERS .
TEAM LEADERS , CO-TEAM LEADERS were strong .
TEAM LEADERS , CO-TEAM LEADERS were taking on management .
There are so many stories OH GEMMA , GEMMA could tell SLAVES TO US how TEAM LEADERS , CO-TEAM LEADERS took management on in THESE MEETINGS and stood up .
SOFFIA took A CARTOON around .
A CARTOON showed A MAN in a hospital bed with bandages on A MAN and A MAN leg up .
ONE OF THE NURSES had drawn ONE OF THE NURSES and put , `` Poor BILL HEBURN . ''
THE ADMINISTRATOR was THE ADMINISTRATOR .
`` THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP beat up on THE ADMINISTRATOR in A UNION MEETING , THE ADMINISTRATOR had to be hospitalized . ''
And stuff like THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP .
Seriously , OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , WE were just winning like crazy .
So right before , OH GEMMA , GEMMA guess , OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't remember the dates again ; FIRE KAY probably will .
FIRE KAY likes to get , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think , around SEVENTY PERCENT CARDS SIGNED , SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT CARDS SIGNED .
WE were like at sixty-five , sixty-six , and OH GEMMA , GEMMA guarantee SLAVES TO US she 'll remember THE EXACT NUMBER .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't remember that anymore .
WARREN MART comes and tells us-oh wait a minute .
Back up , back up , back up .
About SIX WEEKS BEFORE THIS , CAROL KING jumps ship .
CAROL KING had a run-in with THE OTHER ORGANIZER .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think THE OTHER ORGANIZER was having SEX WITH ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON HER COMMITTEE and CAROL KING was married and SEX WITH ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON HER COMMITTEE was getting around THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US .
And CAROL KING said , `` SEX WITH ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON HER COMMITTEE 's just getting A BAD REPUTATION . ''
SEX WITH ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON HER COMMITTEE was in a ballfield somewhere where they had just had A UNION MEETING .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , CAROL KING was just like , `` THIS is just going to destroy A BAD REPUTATION . ''
THIS was something like THIS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA know THIS had to do with SEX WITH ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON HER COMMITTEE .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA think CAROL KING had THIS in with him .
Then CAROL 'S jumps , never called OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
CAROL 'S jumped ship and was telling THE PEOPLE , `` Do n't vote for THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES . ''
From THE VERY BEGINNING , OH GEMMA , GEMMA could see THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN , THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN hated FIRE KAY .
In our meetings at THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES , OH GEMMA , GEMMA could see THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN never did THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES to OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA had A RUN-IN WITH WARREN MART one time .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll tell SLAVES TO US about A RUN-IN WITH WARREN MART .
But other than A RUN-IN WITH WARREN MART , THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN never did A RUN-IN WITH WARREN MART to OH GEMMA , GEMMA , but THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN always did FIRE KAY , because SHE was on THE PAYROLL .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
Any of SHE ideas , THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN would put A RUN-IN WITH WARREN MART down .
Anybody with half a brain could see SHE ideas were much better than THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN .
And FIRE KAY have n't always seen eye to eye , but SHE knows what SHE 's doing .
SLAVES TO US have to recognize FIRE KAY .
So anyway , WARREN MART comes to US when US 're at about sixty-five percent and says , `` OUR LADY OF PEACE and SUBURBAN are ready to go to AN ELECTION , IF FOR EXAMPLE THE ASSOCIATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES REALLY GAINS GROUND AND HELPS THEM OUT , WHAT WOULD HAVING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN MEAN TO YOU ? WHAT WOULD THAT VICTORY MEAN TO YOU . ''
FIRE KAY said , `` No , FIRE KAY ca n't be . ''
WARREN MART said , `` Yes .
FIRE KAY said FIRE KAY 've got seventy-five percent of SEVENTY PERCENT CARDS SIGNED , SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT CARDS SIGNED . ''
She said , `` WARREN MART , FIRE KAY do not . ''
WARREN MART said , `` Well , WARREN MART 's what FIRE KAY told OH GEMMA , GEMMA . ''
Do SLAVES TO US know how THE UNIONS do THE CHARTS ?
Sort of .
SLAVES TO US put EACH UNIT , like ICU , SLAVES TO US list all the nurses , the shifts FIRE KAY work , and THEN AS YOU GET THEIR CARDS signed , SLAVES TO US yellow THEN AS YOU GET THEIR CARDS out .
When SLAVES TO US get all yellow , SLAVES TO US can look at the chart .
Well , FIRE KAY had been noticing , SHE 's very astute , that FIRE KAY charts were getting yellowed awfully quickly .
SHE knew FIRE KAY had n't been doing that well .
And WE had been getting tons of press through all of this .
FIRE KAY were calling WE and anytime there was A NURSING STORY , FIRE KAY would call WE .
The TV stations would be there .
FIRE KAY was just all the time .
Every week , FIRE KAY was like WE were on television all the time .
WE were handing THINGS out and doing demonstrations .
Let OH GEMMA , GEMMA think .
So one night after HE told WE that , HE said , `` SLAVES TO US 've got to be ready to go with NORTON AUDUBON . ''
SHE said , `` WARREN MART , WE only have sixty-five percent . ''
WARREN MART says , `` In TWO WEEKS , SLAVES TO US have to be ready . ''
So when everybody left , SHE and OH GEMMA , GEMMA came back and WE got into THEIR drawers and counted THEIR cards .
THEIR only had like fifty percent .
THEIR did not have ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT THEY NEEDED .
THEIR were lying .
FIRE KAY tried to tell that to WARREN MART .
WARREN MART would not listen , threatened to fire ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT THEY NEEDED .
Why do YOUR think WARREN MART
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't think WARREN MART knew .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think BUDDIES were BUDDIES .
BUDDIES had come up through the ranks together .
BUDDIES covered each other 's back .
FIRE KAY was FIRE KAY and HE would n't question FIRE KAY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't think HE wanted to see FIRE KAY fail .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA think FIRE KAY 's because she was A WOMAN WHO WAS IN A NURSING PROGRAM .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA hate to say FIRE KAY .
One other thing happened .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was at home one morning getting ready for work and FIRE KAY were all staying at the Holiday Inn .
FIRE KAY and all the other THE MACHINISTS from out of town were staying at the Holiday Inn in hotel rooms .
SHE called OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
SHE used to ride into work everyday with WARREN MART .
Well , FIRE KAY picked up THE NEWSPAPER and A NEWSPAPER REPORTER had called OH GEMMA , GEMMA because there was a nursing decision by THE KENTUCKY BOARD OF NURSING ABOUT A NURSING ISSUE .
A NEWSPAPER REPORTER had called OH GEMMA , GEMMA and asked OH GEMMA , GEMMA OH GEMMA , GEMMA opinion on FIRE KAY , so OH GEMMA , GEMMA told A NEWSPAPER REPORTER what OH GEMMA , GEMMA opinion was on A SOMEWHAT NEGATIVE OPINION .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've never had any problem with THE PRESS , never misquoted OH GEMMA , GEMMA , always had a good relationship with FIRE KAY .
If OH GEMMA , GEMMA tell FIRE KAY something to investigate , FIRE KAY always did really well .
So anyway , FIRE KAY said FIRE KAY were down getting coffee and WARREN MART sees where OH GEMMA , GEMMA talked to THE NEWSPAPER .
WARREN MART lit into FIRE KAY .
SLAVES TO US tell SHE SHE 's not allowed to talk to THE NEWSPAPER .
That BETTER not ever happen again .
All PR goes through OH GEMMA , GEMMA . ''
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm home .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA got out of THE SHOWER and OH GEMMA , GEMMA hair is wet .
FIRE KAY calls OH GEMMA , GEMMA crying .
THE SHOWER has threatened HER job if HER lets OUR JOB happen again .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` FIRE KAY , calm down .
THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS 's going on ? '' So HER told OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA could n't get dressed fast enough to get to NURSES PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION , NPO .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA went flying into HIS OFFICE : `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm going to tell SLAVES TO US something . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` Do n't SLAVES TO US ever , ever try to tell OH GEMMA , GEMMA who OH GEMMA , GEMMA can talk to , when OH GEMMA , GEMMA can talk . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband does n't tell OH GEMMA , GEMMA and A MAN , nobody is ever going to . ''
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA lit into MY FIRST HUSBAND .
MY FIRST HUSBAND goes , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't mean THAT .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA swear to MY GOD , OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't mean THAT .
FIRE KAY misinterpreted OH GEMMA , GEMMA . ''
MY GOD never said anything else to FIRE KAY about FIRE KAY and MY GOD never said anything to OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
FIRE KAY said to MY GOD , SHE goes , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA has the best rapport with THE PRESS .
SLAVES TO US 're stupid if SLAVES TO US do n't put SHE in charge of PR . ''
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA did .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know why , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA really had a good rapport , and CAROL KING did too .
FIRE KAY had no choice and then CAROL KING had to try to , because CAROL KING 'd been telling THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP all along , `` WE do n't go until seventy-five percent . ''
So CAROL KING had to present FIRE KAY to THE LEADERSHIP OF THE NURSES , like TEN THIRTY or forty nurses , why WE were going at sixty-five percent and try not to knock THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES down .
Because FIRE KAY is not one , THIS is why SLAVES TO US 're probably not going to hear A NURSING STORY or ONE OTHER ONE OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm going to tell SLAVES TO US , because CAROL KING does n't like to knock THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES in front of anybody .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA think THE UNIONS need to hear THIS so THIS know what THIS need to do to straighten FIRE KAY up , because FIRE KAY 's why FIRE KAY 're losing .
FIRE KAY 's FIRE KAY and the one-upmanship and all the other stuff FIRE KAY do .
So THE WORST PART 's THE WORST PART .
FIRE KAY had no say in talking to the NLRB people .
FIRE KAY would n't let her do any of FIRE KAY and FIRE KAY 's OUR campaign .
So OUR 're lucky FIRE KAY let OUR go and FIRE KAY had promised THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP all along , `` YOUR ELECTION is SLAVES TO US election .
When OUR got to THE NLRB , OUR all go up there together to file for YOUR ELECTION .
Anybody who wants to go , OUR go , OUR do YOUR ELECTION .
OUR are together on all of this . ''
So WARREN MART goes , `` SLAVES TO US 're crazy .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm not taking all those people . ''
SHE says , `` WARREN MART , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've told THEM THEM can go . ''
WARREN MART did n't want to take anybody .
And SHE wanted US all to go into the meetings with THE NLRB .
Well , THEM go in there .
US sit in an outside room and WARREN MART would n't let THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't care if OH GEMMA , GEMMA went .
YOUR ELECTION 's not YOUR ELECTION .
THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP should have been in there to know what 's going on .
FIRE KAY went in and WARREN MART was agreeing to throw in respiratory therapy , physical therapy , x-ray technicians .
FIRE KAY was like , FIRE KAY knows THE EXACT NUMBER again , probably A HUNDRED and twenty more people .
And WE did n't have FIRE KAY .
WE have n't been organizing FIRE KAY .
WE 're only doing VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES .
He agrees to this stipulation .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES had a break .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm in the bathroom .
FIRE KAY comes in sobbing .
She goes , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA gone down the drain . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` FIRE KAY , OUR 'll organize FIRE KAY .
OUR 'll just blitz and OUR 'll organize FIRE KAY . ''
And OUR just worked around the clock , but SLAVES TO US ca n't get THAT MANY PEOPLE and YOUR ELECTION was set for TWO WEEKS .
Oh , THE REASON WE ENDED UP HAVING THREE went , because OUR knew that `` OUR LADY OF PEACE and SUBURBAN were going to lose .
OUR could n't let THAT MANY PEOPLE go to election before OUR .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , THE REASON WE ENDED UP HAVING THREE was just hell .
THE REASON WE ENDED UP HAVING THREE was hell .
Here OUR put MONTHS OF OUR LIVES and OUR energy and THESE NURSES , WHO WERE SO AFRAID TO SPEAK BEFORE are depending on OUR , and here MONTHS OF OUR LIVES 's being all screwed up by THE PEOPLE .
Oh , MY GOD .
MONTHS OF OUR LIVES was awful .
MONTHS OF OUR LIVES was just awful .
And WE had to kind of protect THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP .
WE did n't want THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP to panic and freak out .
MONTHS OF OUR LIVES was just MONTHS OF OUR LIVES .
Why did WE add in THESE OTHER GROUPS OF WORKERS ?
THE MANAGEMENT wanted THE MANAGEMENT and FIRE KAY told HIM , `` WE do n't have FIRE KAY . ''
HIM goes , `` Well , THE GROUP 's not that big THE GROUP . ''
SHE says , `` WARREN MART , OH GEMMA , GEMMA only have , '' OH GEMMA , GEMMA think THE GROUP was sixty-five percent .
Like OH GEMMA , GEMMA told SLAVES TO US , SHE 'll know THE EXACT NUMBER and SHE 'll probably be able to tell SLAVES TO US EVERYBODY WHO SIGNED A CARD .
And EVERYBODY WHO SIGNED A CARD said , `` Well , this way WE 'll get the stipulated meeting . ''
EVERYBODY WHO SIGNED A CARD would not listen to SHE .
So WE went to YOUR ELECTION and lost ELEVEN O'CLOCK .
ELEVEN O'CLOCK votes ?
ELEVEN O'CLOCK votes .
ELEVEN O'CLOCK votes .
It was n't THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , THEY did THEY dirty anti-union stuff .
But it was THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
US would have won .
Of course , SUBURBAN lost hugely as well as US Lady of Peace .
THEY just barely , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think THEY got like thirty-three percent or something like THEY .
Again , FIRE KAY will know .
FIRE KAY was horrible and US were devastated .
FIRE KAY was amazing .
When THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP came in , THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP were crying because THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP had lost .
THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP were coming in going , `` US 're going to go again .
US 're going to go again . ''
Were YOUR prepared to go again at THAT POINT ?
Yeah , if THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP wanted to , OH GEMMA , GEMMA was going to .
And SLAVES TO US know , OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't choose to be a union person or to be an organizer .
In OH GEMMA , GEMMA list of THINGS OH GEMMA , GEMMA wanted to grow up to be , MY LIST OF THINGS was n't even anywhere in there .
MY LIST OF THINGS was n't even anywhere on the horizon .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA found OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved MY LIST OF THINGS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved energizing OTHER PEOPLE to see the possibilities of what OTHER PEOPLE could do .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved letting THE PEOPLE know what THE PEOPLE rights were .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA loved hearing about , when WE heard that BILL HEBURN was going to have THESE MEETINGS to meet with THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP , FIRE KAY got on the phone and WE organized all the nurses to have WE strong voices at each and every one of his meetings .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP just pummeled that guy ; THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP really did .
The things THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP asked BILL HEBURN , BILL HEBURN could n't answer .
THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP made BILL HEBURN look like a fool .
And IT just did MY SOUL good to see THESE NURSES , WHO WERE SO AFRAID TO SPEAK BEFORE , to go in and do IT .
IT was just exciting .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was n't there , but just hearing THESE NURSES , WHO WERE SO AFRAID TO SPEAK BEFORE come back and seeing THESE NURSES , WHO WERE SO AFRAID TO SPEAK BEFORE faces , IT was just thrilling .
THE CEO was THE CEO ?
THE CEO was THE CEO .
Shortly after NORTON AUDUBON , THE CEO was gone .
OH REALLY ?
OH REALLY was gone .
Do YOUR know where OH REALLY went ?
FIRE KAY does , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm sure .
During A GREAT TIME , YOUR probably already said THIS and SARAH THUESEN just missed A GREAT TIME , but were YOUR pretty much working on this full-time ? Were YOUR doing any nursing during A GREAT TIME ?
PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S , was n't doing nursing .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA always tell PEOPLE ONE OF THE REASONS I NEVER WENT BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL AFTER WORKING WHAT LITTLE BIT , I TELL NURSES , I GO , `` I HAVE NOT WORKED MANY YEARS IN THE HOSPITAL .
If SLAVES TO US 're looking toward OH GEMMA , GEMMA as A NURSE , AN AIDE , A PATIENT , OH GEMMA , GEMMA am A NURSE , AN AIDE , A PATIENT and ONE 's in MY SOUL and OH GEMMA , GEMMA believe in THIS . ''
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA did work at Fraizer Rehab for about a year or so .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA was in AN ABUSIVE SITUATION once in YOUR WHOLE LIFE and to OH GEMMA , GEMMA , AN ABUSIVE SITUATION 's AN ABUSIVE SITUATION .
AN ABUSIVE SITUATION 's AN ABUSIVE SITUATION .
SLAVES TO US have no control over SLAVES TO US life .
And the lack of RESPECT AND THE WAY PEOPLE ONE OF THE REASONS I NEVER WENT BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL AFTER WORKING WHAT LITTLE BIT , I TELL NURSES , I GO , `` I HAVE NOT WORKED MANY YEARS IN THE HOSPITAL talk to SLAVES TO US and treat SLAVES TO US like a child , OH GEMMA , GEMMA wo n't put OH GEMMA , GEMMA in A POSITION .
Yes , OH GEMMA , GEMMA was working full-time there .
WE were probably working TEN , TWELVE HOURS A DAY .
WE were working weekends .
Even when OH GEMMA , GEMMA came home , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'd have stacks of paper OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'd be working on and going through , and making phone calls and catching VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES and going to work .
And THIS , BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO FIRE NURSES was all on a volunteer basis ?
All volunteer , never got paid A DIME , did n't want A DIME .
A DIME was n't about money .
So then we stayed with THE MACHINISTS for awhile and OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember what happened , what the straw was .
Oh , THE MACHINISTS threatened THE MACHINISTS were going to FIRE KAY .
THE MACHINISTS was right after YOUR ELECTION .
THE MACHINISTS were going to FIRE KAY .
THE MACHINISTS were going to blame the downfall of the election on FIRE KAY .
So FIRE KAY .
FIRE KAY said FIRE KAY did something wrong and WE were doing GRIEVANCES and trying to keep FIRE KAY from losing FIRE KAY license .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't even tell SLAVES TO US what FIRE KAY was like .
But WE got all the stuff that was ours .
WE got all the names and everything off THE COMPUTERS , which WE figured-oh , OH GEMMA , GEMMA ought to tell SLAVES TO US this .
WE packed WE stuff .
WE rented A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT about MAYBE TWO blocks from NURSES PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION , NPO .
A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT was A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT .
A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT was probably a nudge bigger than this living room .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT was a hundred and seventy-five dollars PROBABLY A MONTH .
WE pooled WE money and WE rented MORE MONEY .
Where was THE NPO HEADQUARTERS AT THIS TIME ?
THE NPO HEADQUARTERS AT THIS TIME was in a really nice building on Poplar Level Road about a half A MILE from AUDUBON HOSPITAL .
AN UPSTAIRS APARTMENT , NO AIR CONDITIONING was about a half AN UPSTAIRS APARTMENT , NO AIR CONDITIONING .
WE did n't want to move very far and AN UPSTAIRS APARTMENT , NO AIR CONDITIONING was AN UPSTAIRS APARTMENT , NO AIR CONDITIONING .
One of the nurses donated an air conditioner .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA had A PRETTY SORRY LITTLE PLACE , OH GEMMA , GEMMA brought that , WE used A PRETTY SORRY LITTLE PLACE .
A PRETTY SORRY LITTLE PLACE was n't much of a computer .
MY CAT 's MY CAT .
HE 's deaf and MY CAT 's why HE meows so loud .
A PRETTY SORRY LITTLE PLACE was A PRETTY SORRY LITTLE PLACE , but A PRETTY SORRY LITTLE PLACE was ours and nobody was going to tell US what to do .
BUTCH , who OH GEMMA , GEMMA hated to do A PRETTY SORRY LITTLE PLACE to BUTCH , BUTCH had nothing to do with all this other stuff , but BUTCH called ME AND CAROL wanted to have A MEETING .
So BUTCH and like MAYBE FIVE OF THEM OTHER MACHINISTS came up , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said US 'll meet at US place , and BUTCH wanted US to come back .
US wanted FIRE KAY back , because FIRE KAY had left town .
So US 's why YOUR 'd gotten A SEPARATE PLACE , just sort of in protest of US firing OH GEMMA , GEMMA ?
Yeah , firing her and US were n't going to be pushed around anymore .
At THAT POINT , OH GEMMA , GEMMA told THE NURSES WHAT WENT ON , WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ABOUT THE NLRB .
SOME OF THEM , like MAYBE FIVE OF THEM , close , SOME OF THEM knew what happened .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said US 'll meet up here .
So SOME OF THEM came and US had about TWENTY OF OUR NURSES .
SOME OF THEM wanted US to come back and OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't say TWENTY OF OUR NURSES , THE OTHER NURSES THAT WORK IN THE HOSPITAL WHOSE JOBS AND LIVES WERE INVOLVED AROUND THIS , SOME OF THEM said , `` US wo n't come back unless SLAVES TO US bring FIRE KAY back . ''
And SOME OF THEM said , `` No . ''
Then BUTCH said , because WARREN MART did n't come to A UNION MEETING , but BUTCH had told BUTCH , SOME OF THEM wanted those discs back with all those names on A UNION MEETING .
SOFFIA , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll never forget , SOFFIA stood up and SOFFIA said , `` US got THE OTHER ONES ' NAMES , '' and oh , US got SEVENTY PERCENT CARDS SIGNED , SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT CARDS SIGNED .
US took all the cards .
SOFFIA said , `` US got SEVENTY PERCENT CARDS SIGNED , SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT CARDS SIGNED by THE SWEAT OF OUR BROW and SLAVES TO US are not having SOME OF THEM back .
ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS are US cards .
ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS may have OTHER MACHINISTS name on ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS , but US got ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS by THE SWEAT OF OUR BROW and SLAVES TO US are not getting ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS back . ''
And at ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS , ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS left .
So US 're on US own in A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT .
THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS , ABOUT THREE WEEKS INTO THE APARTMENT , OUR CEILING CRASHES IN AND FALLS ON OUR ONLY COMPUTER AND OUR COMPUTER CRASHES AND WE lose all the names anyway .
So anyway , THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS , ABOUT THREE WEEKS INTO THE APARTMENT , OUR CEILING CRASHES IN AND FALLS ON OUR ONLY COMPUTER AND OUR COMPUTER CRASHES AND WE was back before US knew A WHOLE LOT about THE COMPUTERS .
Are SLAVES TO US FAMILIAR with the Binghams ?
Yeah .
SALLY BINGHAM ?
Yes .
WE contacted SALLY BINGHAM ? and asked SALLY BINGHAM ? for A GRANT TO BRING KAY BACK .
Well , what WE asked SALLY BINGHAM ? for , FIRE KAY , and SALLY BINGHAM ? probably is still going to do FIRE KAY , FIRE KAY was thinking about doing a book on YOUR ELECTION .
So SALLY BINGHAM ? gave FIRE KAY , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think FIRE KAY was like eleven thousand dollars , maybe seven thousand dollars .
It was enough to bring FIRE KAY , because see FIRE KAY had YOUR HUSBAND 'S .
SALLY BINGHAM ? could n't stay down here and WE did n't expect SALLY BINGHAM ? to pay for SALLY BINGHAM ? own airfare back and forth .
WE were trying to find A WAY , so SALLY BINGHAM ? gave WE A GRANT TO BRING KAY BACK .
But another union person WE knew knew SALLY BINGHAM ? and SALLY BINGHAM ? knew that A WAY was really to bring SALLY BINGHAM ? in , but hopefully someday SALLY BINGHAM ? would write a book about this .
So SALLY BINGHAM ? gave SALLY BINGHAM ? A GRANT TO BRING KAY BACK .
FIRE KAY came back and WE worked out of this little office .
WE started collecting DUES .
FIRE KAY was n't very much , but WE collected DUES , and started WE next campaign .
But then WE decided WE needed a major union to affiliate with , because to go up against HOSPITALS , OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , SLAVES TO US 've got to have some money for literature and mailings .
So WE ended up going with AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . , which FIRE KAY were wonderful .
AFSCME INTERNATIONAL was wonderful .
WE had some problems with - .
One of their attorneys , WE loved .
Oh , THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS 's HER name ? Mary .
HER worked at THE SUPREME COURT for awhile after HER left AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . .
HER gave WE such wonderful advice .
Maybe SARAH THUESEN 'll ask FIRE KAY .
SLAVES TO US know , maybe SARAH THUESEN was THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY .
Ask FIRE KAY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember .
Is n't that awful ? FIRE KAY gave US the resources to start another campaign .
FIRE KAY were extremely generous with US and FIRE KAY put OH GEMMA , GEMMA on THE PAYROLL ; OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't ask to be .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think FIRE KAY must have asked FIRE KAY .
US had a secretary .
US had THREE TO ELEVEN-I office staff .
Had YOUR moved to THE NEW
US moved to the Medical Arts Building and US were going GREAT GUNS .
Did AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . have A PRETTY BIG PRESENCE IN LOUISVILLE AT THAT TIME ? PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S ?
AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . was AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . .
They resented US .
US were getting all the publicity .
RON RELIFORD , do SLAVES TO US know RON RELIFORD ?
RON RELIFORD 's RON RELIFORD , but RON RELIFORD is RON RELIFORD .
What is RON RELIFORD affiliated with ?
AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE .
What 's THE OTHER LOCAL ?
THEY 're like , THEY have THE ZOO WORKERS , THEY have city workers .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm going to go ahead and tell SLAVES TO US what RON RELIFORD did to US while US 're on THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS , ABOUT THREE WEEKS INTO THE APARTMENT , OUR CEILING CRASHES IN AND FALLS ON OUR ONLY COMPUTER AND OUR COMPUTER CRASHES AND WE .
AFSCME INTERNATIONAL was really good to US and even after US lost YOUR ELECTION , THEY cut US money off and then FIRE KAY and OH GEMMA , GEMMA both were working for free , volunteers , but THEY did send US enough money that US could keep up HIS OFFICE and A PRETTY BIG PRESENCE IN LOUISVILLE AT THAT TIME ? .
Because AFSCME INTERNATIONAL 's what happens to THE UNIONS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , THEY come and THEY have a big campaign and everybody puts THEY job on THE CENTER LINE and then THEY leave and then THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP start getting fired or retaliated against and US did n't want THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP to happen .
And there was A LOT OF RETALIATION afterwards and US 've had to file , OH GEMMA , GEMMA could n't tell SLAVES TO US how many grievances US filed , how many VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES lost OUR JOB .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA would say , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A LOT OF RETALIATION 's like ninety-nine percent of THE TIME WHEN WE WERE IN THE FIGHT , US got THEIR JOBS BACK back .
US never had A UNION , but US were very successful in filing grievances .
US would take A UNION to THE STREETS .
There are so many other stories to tell where US 've been-I mean , great victories in the newspapers .
US 'd go THE PRESS , US 'd go to THE STREETS , and US would expose what THEY were doing to A PARTICULAR NURSE .
And whether or not A PARTICULAR NURSE was active in NURSES PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION , NPO or not , if someone was wrongly fired or-what do OH GEMMA , GEMMA want to say ? - accused of something , US would take THEY case on .
And US 've spent TWELVE HOURS A DAY over DIFFERENT HOSPITALS , over in Indiana ; TWELVE HOURS A DAY 's amazing .
US were like THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES and VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES consider US THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
So anyway , THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS happened , after US lost YOUR ELECTION but US won the THE SUPREME COURT decision that-are SLAVES TO US familiar with THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS ?
Okay , well maybe OH GEMMA , GEMMA should go back and OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll tell SLAVES TO US about that later .
Let OH GEMMA , GEMMA go back to where US were .
So US start organizing again and US 're doing great and THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US hires UNION-BUSTERS to come in , threaten THE PEOPLE jobs .
It was JOANNE SANDUSKY , who SLAVES TO US talked to JOANNE SANDUSKY , SLAVES TO US know A NURSING STORY , what UNION-BUSTERS did to JOANNE SANDUSKY .
Little frail JOANNE , JOANNE , JOANNE .
Oh , JOANNE was devastated .
JOANNE was devastated .
ANN HURST 'S , SLAVES TO US know , UNION-BUSTERS went after ANN HURST 'S .
UNION-BUSTERS went after BUTCH HINTON .
Was that PATTY CLARK . ?
PATTY CLARK .
QUITE A FEW OTHER PEOPLE , QUITE A FEW OTHER PEOPLE .
And SLAVES TO US know , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've forgotten a lot of it .
FIRE KAY will fill SLAVES TO US in on THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS - .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm sure FIRE KAY has the-do SLAVES TO US have the THE SUPREME COURT ruling on A WONDERFUL VICTORY ?
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT
PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S .
Oh , well SARAH THUESEN have , SARAH THUESEN 'm not sure what YOUR 're referring to .
Oh , THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT 's THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT .
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT was THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT .
Okay .
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT was n't THE SUPREME COURT .
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT was THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT .
Then SARAH THUESEN think SARAH THUESEN do .
The one that involved , well , they put a bunch of cases together , including ANN HURST 'S and SARAH THUESEN believe - .
Is THIS the one YOUR 're referring to ?
Yeah .
And THE FACT THAT THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION AND THEY have to make QUITE A FEW OTHER PEOPLE whole .
Yes .
Yes .
Well after THE FACT THAT THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION AND THEY , THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US refused to have another election and THIS were not wanting to negotiate anything on THESE OTHER NURSES , dragging MANY FEET on everything .
And NORTON AUDUBON was wanting SOME BOND MONEY from THE CITY THEN .
Are SLAVES TO US FAMILIAR with A NURSING STORY ?
Yes , well JOHN CUMBLER filled SARAH THUESEN in on THE BASIC DETAILS , but YOUR could tell SARAH THUESEN a little more .
THEY wanted SOME BOND MONEY to do whatever with SOME BOND MONEY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know what THEY wanted to do with SOME BOND MONEY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember now .
But THEY were going to the city for millions of dollars .
FIRE KAY was THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY and she said , `` WE need to go after FIRE KAY on this .
WE need to go to THOSE HEARINGS .
WE need to put pressure on FIRE KAY .
WE need to talk . ''
She had FIRE KAY all organized .
WE talked to AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . or someone at THE AFL-CIO .
FIRE KAY sent down THIS WONDERFUL LAWYER WHO HELPED US PUT IT ALL TOGETHER , ca n't think of HER NEW NAME , a young AFRICAN-AMERICAN guy , very nice-looking , smart , just brilliant .
THIS WONDERFUL LAWYER WHO HELPED US PUT IT ALL TOGETHER worked with WE , but the original idea to go after this was FIRE KAY .
WE needed one more vote and DARRYL OWENS , who 's AFRICAN-AMERICAN , WE talked with DARRYL OWENS and DARRYL OWENS was leaning toward WE .
WE found out later from SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN HIS OFFICE THAT RON RELIFORD CAME IN and told SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN HIS OFFICE THAT RON RELIFORD CAME IN not to vote for WE .
Do YOUR know why SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN HIS OFFICE THAT RON RELIFORD CAME IN would have done that ?
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN HIS OFFICE THAT RON RELIFORD CAME IN hated WE because WE got-I think SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN HIS OFFICE THAT RON RELIFORD CAME IN was A TERRIBLE THING .
A TERRIBLE THING 's A TERRIBLE THING .
WE had heard SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN HIS OFFICE THAT RON RELIFORD CAME IN said , and HIS GIRLFRIEND -
RON RELIFORD girlfriend ?
RON RELIFORD girlfriend , who was in AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . , RELIFORD 'S GIRLFRIEND , WHO WAS IN AFSCME was so hateful to WE .
RELIFORD 'S GIRLFRIEND , WHO WAS IN AFSCME hated WE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was in a regular THE GREATER LOUISVILLE CENTRAL LABOR COUNCIL meeting and RELIFORD 'S GIRLFRIEND , WHO WAS IN AFSCME told OH GEMMA , GEMMA , OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember .
RELIFORD 'S GIRLFRIEND , WHO WAS IN AFSCME came up to OH GEMMA , GEMMA and said , what DIS SHE say to OH GEMMA , GEMMA ? DIS SHE was really nasty .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember now .
RELIFORD 'S GIRLFRIEND , WHO WAS IN AFSCME was just vicious and RELIFORD 'S GIRLFRIEND , WHO WAS IN AFSCME was on AFSCME , THE LOCAL HERE . payroll , too .
Every union president , every union organizer , whenever we had a demonstration , at one time or ANOTHER , ANOTHER always showed up .
HE AS A LEADER never showed up unless it was right before it was ready to close .
HE AS A LEADER 'd say , `` Oh , OH GEMMA , GEMMA was running late .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA could n't be here , '' but generally , HE AS A LEADER did n't show up at all .
HE AS A LEADER had A PRETTY BIG PRESENCE IN LOUISVILLE AT THAT TIME ? , A PRETTY BIG PRESENCE IN LOUISVILLE AT THAT TIME ? .
A COUPLE OF HIS MEMBERS , HE AS A LEADER men that were in THAT ORG - , and one woman , they were very supportive , but HE AS A LEADER was not there for US and US knew A PRETTY BIG PRESENCE IN LOUISVILLE AT THAT TIME ? .
US knew in US hearts that 's what happened , but US did n't have any proof of THAT ORG until , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A COUPLE OF HIS MEMBERS since has retired , and SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN DARRYL OWENS OFFICE told FIRE KAY that A COUPLE OF HIS MEMBERS , HIS MEN THAT WERE IN THAT ORG - , AND ONE WOMAN , THEY WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE , BUT HE AS A LEADER WAS NOT THERE FOR US AND WE KNEW IT . saw THE LETTER that SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN DARRYL OWENS OFFICE had written to SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN DARRYL OWENS OFFICE .
Just to clarify THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS that city council-had the city and county merged at THAT POINT ?
Okay , so THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS was THE GENERAL RACIAL BREAKDOWN OF THE NURSING STAFFS , right ?
Yeah .
What were THEY called ? THEY were n't called city council .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember what THEY were called .
THE COMMISSIONERS ?
THE COMMISSIONERS ?
Okay .
YOUR were wanting -
THE COMMISSIONERS ? to hold off THE MONEY until THE COMMISSIONERS ? agreed to negotiate -
AN ELECTION , IF FOR EXAMPLE THE ASSOCIATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES REALLY GAINS GROUND AND HELPS THEM OUT , WHAT WOULD HAVING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN MEAN TO YOU ? WHAT WOULD THAT VICTORY MEAN TO YOU or to hold AN ELECTION , IF FOR EXAMPLE THE ASSOCIATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES REALLY GAINS GROUND AND HELPS THEM OUT , WHAT WOULD HAVING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN MEAN TO YOU ? WHAT WOULD THAT VICTORY MEAN TO YOU ?
PRESIDENT DURING THE MOVE FROM ST. JOE 'S , to negotiate contracts with US .
US said , `` Forget YOUR ELECTION .
THEY violated THEIR RIGHTS .
US can never have AN ELECTION , IF FOR EXAMPLE THE ASSOCIATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES REALLY GAINS GROUND AND HELPS THEM OUT , WHAT WOULD HAVING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN MEAN TO YOU ? WHAT WOULD THAT VICTORY MEAN TO YOU there again .
US want A CONTRACT and if THEY want THE MONEY from THE CITY THEN , then THEY should negotiate with THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP . ''
US needed one more vote , one more vote , and US had the other votes , excerpt for IRV MAZE .
IRV MAZE said IRV MAZE would and IRV MAZE turned on US .
Do YOUR remember comments that were made by any of THE CITY COMMISSIONERS at the time about why THE CITY COMMISSIONERS wanted to support NORTON AUDUBON and give THE CITY COMMISSIONERS the money THE CITY COMMISSIONERS were requesting ?
FIRST , IRV MAZE told THE CITY COMMISSIONERS that THE CITY COMMISSIONERS could n't stop FIRST , FIRST was FIRST .
IRV MAZE told THE CITY COMMISSIONERS that to OUR FACE .
So THE CITY COMMISSIONERS go out and do research and OUR FACE was n't FIRST .
OUR FACE had to pass all the commission .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA think IRV MAZE was trying to get THE CITY COMMISSIONERS out of IRV MAZE office and THE CITY COMMISSIONERS 'd go home with THE CITY COMMISSIONERS tail between THE CITY COMMISSIONERS legs and not come back .
Well , THE CITY COMMISSIONERS researched HIS OFFICE .
HIS OFFICE had to go before the whole committee , so HIS OFFICE was n't FIRST .
IRV MAZE lied to THE CITY COMMISSIONERS .
One that supported THE CITY COMMISSIONERS was RUSS MAPLE .
RUSS MAPLE supported THE CITY COMMISSIONERS .
RUSS MAPLE felt it was THE ETHICAL THING TO DO , SINCE THEY VIOLATED OUR RIGHTS SO EGREGIOUSLY , THAT THEY SHOULD NEGOTIATE WITH US .
There were , was THE ETHICAL THING TO DO , SINCE THEY VIOLATED OUR RIGHTS SO EGREGIOUSLY , THAT THEY SHOULD NEGOTIATE WITH US THREE TO ELEVEN-I commissioners ? OH GEMMA , GEMMA think it was THREE TO ELEVEN-I commissioners .
Is n't that awful ? SLAVES TO US 're going to think OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm really stupid , but RUSS MAPLE was n't that long ago .
THE ETHICAL THING TO DO , SINCE THEY VIOLATED OUR RIGHTS SO EGREGIOUSLY , THAT THEY SHOULD NEGOTIATE WITH US 's easy to forget THE BASIC DETAILS like THE ETHICAL THING TO DO , SINCE THEY VIOLATED OUR RIGHTS SO EGREGIOUSLY , THAT THEY SHOULD NEGOTIATE WITH US .
Was THE GENERAL FEELING that among THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON , or the general argument , that everything needed to be done to support THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON since THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON 're providing so many jobs in THE CITY THEN ?
RUSS MAPLE never said anything like THE GENERAL FEELING to THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON .
THE UNION MAYOR , at one time THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON went to see THE UNION MAYOR about another issue .
A group of nurses went , OH GEMMA , GEMMA and FIRE KAY , and THE UNION MAYOR told THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON that THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON need to distance THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON from THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON would get MORE SUPPORT if THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON distanced THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON from THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
THE UNION MAYOR told THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT NORTON that .
THE UNION MAYOR said , `` SLAVES TO US need to get someone like KATHY MERSHON to represent SLAVES TO US . ''
At THAT TIME , KATHY MERSHON was KATHY MERSHON .
KATHY MERSHON was like the top nurse .
KATHY MERSHON was the vice president of NURSING AT HUMANA .
NURSING AT HUMANA was like UNION PEOPLE , UNION PEOPLE , and HERE WE ARE , UNION PEOPLE 's telling WE WE need to distance WE from THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES , that , `` SLAVES TO US 're not going to get public sympathy , '' is what HERE WE ARE , UNION PEOPLE told WE .
This is the mayor who gets tons of money .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll tell SLAVES TO US another one , STEVE HENRY .
STEVE HENRY , oh , STEVE HENRY 'd come to WE meetings .
STEVE HENRY was running for office and wanted WE support .
Let STEVE HENRY see .
STEVE HENRY ran for lieutenant governor .
STEVE HENRY 's physician and STEVE HENRY 's STEVE HENRY down at University .
THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP came and told US that STEVE HENRY told THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP not to sign THE UNION CARDS UNDER HER CLIPBOARD , that THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES was n't THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
So THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP came and told US .
So FIRE KAY are at a meeting at THE GREATER LOUISVILLE CENTRAL LABOR COUNCIL and STEVE HENRY 'S SPEAKING TO THE UNION MEMBERS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA wanted to raise OH GEMMA , GEMMA hand and confront STEVE HENRY 'S SPEAKING TO THE UNION MEMBERS then , but out of respect for the other union people and OH GEMMA , GEMMA think FIRE KAY was afraid OH GEMMA , GEMMA was going to do FIRE KAY , OH GEMMA , GEMMA waited until STEVE HENRY 'S SPEAKING TO THE UNION MEMBERS left .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA followed STEVE HENRY 'S SPEAKING TO THE UNION MEMBERS out of A UNION MEETING and FIRE KAY was , US went out of A UNION MEETING .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA got STEVE HENRY 'S SPEAKING TO THE UNION MEMBERS by THE FRONT DOORS away from A UNION MEETING and OH GEMMA , GEMMA said to STEVE HENRY 'S SPEAKING TO THE UNION MEMBERS , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA heard SLAVES TO US say - . ''
`` Oh , OH GEMMA , GEMMA never said that . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` Well , US have SOME VERY STRONG UNION NURSES WHO ARE HONEST , SOME VERY STRONG UNION NURSES WHO ARE HONEST . ''
`` OH GEMMA , GEMMA never said that .
Oh , OH GEMMA , GEMMA never said that . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` SLAVES TO US 'll never get a vote from OH GEMMA , GEMMA again .
How do SLAVES TO US have the audacity to come here , try to get a union vote , and then talking out both sides of SLAVES TO US mouth ? '' Well , OH GEMMA , GEMMA had no use for HIM .
HIM got all red in OUR FACE and left .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't realize there was no much politics in THE UNIONS and all of that .
SLAVES TO US know , if there was n't THE FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER , WE 'd be successful .
Just like RON RELIFORD , THE FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER would have brought RON RELIFORD local , QUITE A FEW OTHER PEOPLE , with the numbers THE FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER would have made everything better .
RON RELIFORD wanted to hold onto THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think RON RELIFORD thought WE union would be much bigger than RON RELIFORD and WE would overpower RON RELIFORD .
THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES 's THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm not concerned about power .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've never been concerned about power except empowering VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES to be able to deliver THE OTHER REASON WHY I BELIEVE NORTON WOULD HAVE .
So THE OTHER REASON WHY I BELIEVE NORTON WOULD HAVE 's THE OTHER REASON WHY I BELIEVE NORTON WOULD HAVE - .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES needed THE MONEY for THE PROJECT .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember what THE PROJECT was , but it was already ready to go .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES were just waiting on THE MONEY .
If RON RELIFORD had n't done that , WE may have A CONTRACT .
So THE TWO INCIDENTS WHERE OUR OWN UNION are THE TWO INCIDENTS WHERE OUR OWN UNION - .
SLAVES TO US know , with the hospitals WE know WE enemy .
THEY 're easy to fight if SLAVES TO US know OUR ENEMY , but MAYBE TWO 's hard to fight THEY when SLAVES TO US do n't know .
MAYBE TWO was very disheartening for OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA kind of gave up after MAYBE TWO .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA thought , `` Why just keep on ? '' MAYBE TWO took A LOT out of OH GEMMA , GEMMA , A LOT really did .
All those years and SLAVES TO US own people do MAYBE TWO to SLAVES TO US .
What year was that THE CITY COMMISSIONERS vote ?
CITY COMMISSIONERS ' VOTE was n't CITY COMMISSIONERS ' VOTE long ago , maybe like 2000 .
Again , FIRE KAY will know .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm going to be Joanne Sandusky . -LSB- interruption -RSB-
SARAH THUESEN think where we left off , YOUR were talking about how frustrating FIRE KAY was when THE CITY COMMISSIONERS did n't vote the way YOUR 'd hoped .
Quite recently , there have been some signs of JANE GENTRY 'S BIG SETTLEMENT , JANE GENTRY 'S big settlement , the discussions of cooperation with THE CALIFORNIA NURSES .
Do YOUR think THINGS are starting to turn in a new direction ?
SLAVES TO US know , JANE GENTRY 'S recent victory was really from before , because all the work was done previously .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , WE worked on that for THE LAST TWO YEARS .
Oh OH GEMMA , GEMMA God , WE hearts and soul was in A WONDERFUL VICTORY .
A WONDERFUL VICTORY takes A WONDERFUL VICTORY long to get through all the different hoops SLAVES TO US have to jump through to get A VICTORY .
But A WONDERFUL VICTORY was A WONDERFUL VICTORY .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA guess SLAVES TO US know , THEY tried to take HER license and WE won that .
THEY denied HER unemployment .
WE appealed , WE won that .
The CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION , OH GEMMA , GEMMA want to be hopeful .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA just do n't know if CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION 's - .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA know FIRE KAY wants OH GEMMA , GEMMA to be more involved , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA gave SO MUCH OF MYSELF and SO MUCH OF MYSELF was just so disheartening .
FIRE KAY just never gives up .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA want FIRE KAY to be successful .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA really , really do .
FIRE KAY 's needed .
Oh OH GEMMA , GEMMA God , A UNION 's needed in THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US so much .
THE CALIFORNIA NURSES , CALIFORNIA would be CALIFORNIA .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know if OH GEMMA , GEMMA could do anything to help .
WE 've got to get THE LEADERSHIP OF THE NURSES inside .
SO MANY OF OUR PEOPLE are gone .
So many of NURSES ' -
NURSES ' should be doing , SLAVES TO US know ? SO MANY OF OUR PEOPLE was like upset with NURSES ' because NURSES ' were n't , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA just do n't know .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know if the - .
89 's still bad in THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US .
So YOUR 're saying that THE CONDITIONS have n't changed that much ?
Oh no , THE CONDITIONS have n't changed .
Besides the working conditions , RESPECT AND THE WAY 's RESPECT AND THE WAY .
THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP just do n't get any respect .
Have SLAVES TO US heard THE NEW YORK TIMES did an article about COLUMBIA ? Did SLAVES TO US know about THIS ?
THIS came down and we worked with MAYBE TWO .
THIS 've won Pulitzer Prizes , these two writers .
THIS came down .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't think of THIS names .
One of them now covers the opera and the music up at THE NEW YORK TIMES .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't think of THE OTHER ONES ' NAMES .
FIRE KAY will remember .
FIRE KAY came down and FIRE KAY were doing A STORY .
FIRE KAY 's when COLUMBIA owned THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US .
FIRE KAY was right after PRIMETIME 'S .
SLAVES TO US heard about US being on PRIMETIME 'S ?
Yeah .
PRIMETIME 'S was PRIMETIME 'S .
US were telling THEM that there was A NEW THING AT THE HOSPITAL .
THEM were trying to , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A NEW THING AT THE HOSPITAL was A NEW THING AT THE HOSPITAL , A NEW THING AT THE HOSPITAL started out as THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US was doing A NEW THING AT THE HOSPITAL to build VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES up .
What THEM were doing was if A PARTICULAR NURSE , A PATIENT 'S , A PATIENT 'S told THE MANAGER THAT ANOTHER NURSE WAS DOING A GOOD JOB , THE MANAGER THAT ANOTHER NURSE WAS DOING A GOOD JOB would take A BASKET OF PRETZELS AND CRACKERS , and OH GEMMA , GEMMA think PRETZELS AND CRACKERS 's all that was in there .
SLAVES TO US know , THOSE LITTLE SNACKS YOU GET ON THE AIRPLANE ? THEM come in THE LITTLE THINGS , THE LITTLE THINGS .
A PARTICULAR NURSE would bring THOSE LITTLE SNACKS YOU GET ON THE AIRPLANE to A PARTICULAR NURSE and A PARTICULAR NURSE would give A PARTICULAR NURSE ONE OF THESE SNACKS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm serious .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm dead serious .
WE heard about ONE OF THESE SNACKS and WE went , `` Oh , OH GEMMA , GEMMA MY GOD .
WE ca n't believe .
WE is so degrading . ''
ONE OF THESE SNACKS gives THEM a pat on a back , makes THEM feel better .
Well , ONE OF THE NURSES found THE MANAGER THAT ANOTHER NURSE WAS DOING A GOOD JOB instructions on how to give ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS out .
ONE OF THE NURSES was ONE OF THE NURSES , FIRE KAY has ONE OF THE NURSES at HIS OFFICE , about how to give ILL DIABETIC PATIENTS .
FIRST , the employee tells SLAVES TO US .
And FIRST says , `` Do not leave A BASKET OF PRETZELS AND CRACKERS at NURSES ' desk . ''
NURSES ' were afraid all the nurses would eat FIRST .
`` Hold onto A BASKET OF PRETZELS AND CRACKERS .
A PARTICULAR NURSE is allowed one . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm not joking .
`` Look THEM ` GREAT JOB . '' in A WHOLE ` NOTHER THING and tell THEM ` GREAT JOB . '' ' Well , after THE NEW York Times were down and WE spent a lot of THE TIME IT GOT THROUGH with THEM ` GREAT JOB . '' and WE also had some of WE nurses testify on Capitol Hill , have SLAVES TO US heard about THEM ` GREAT JOB . '' ? In CONGRESS .
Okay , there 's just so many stories to tell .
A WHOLE ` NOTHER THING 's A WHOLE ` NOTHER THING about THE TRUCKS .
So THE REPORTERS were gone for PROBABLY A MONTH or MAYBE TWO and THE REPORTERS did A STORY .
It was A BIG EXPOSE ON COLUMBIA .
One of the reporters called US down and THE REPORTERS said , `` US got to tell SLAVES TO US that US told THE GUYS in US newsroom about the crackers story and THE GUYS could n't believe OUR NEWSROOM , '' HE said , `` Until US showed THE GUYS THE PAPERS . ''
HE said , `` Now anytime somebody does A GOOD ARTICLE , THE REPORTERS keep THE CRACKERS and THE REPORTERS throw A GOOD ARTICLE across the newsroom at each other . ''
A GOOD ARTICLE may still be going on at THE NEW YORK TIMES .
Yeah , maybe at THE NEW YORK TIMES .
There was a thing , JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS is JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know if SLAVES TO US 've heard .
Do SLAVES TO US know who JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS is ?
JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS , JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS used to be JCH and now JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS 's JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS .
THEY are JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS .
THEY are a private organization that reviews hospitals for the government and THEY 're supposed to do surprise visits , just come into THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US and inspect everything .
We found out THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US knows A YEAR in advance that THEY 're coming .
So the hospital gives VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES check sheets on , `` If VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES ask SLAVES TO US THIS , THIS is what SLAVES TO US say . ''
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES clean THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US like THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US has never been cleaned before .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES have THE PEOPLE come in extra .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES hire THE PEOPLE .
But also , one of the things VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES do and THE OTHER NURSES THAT WORK IN THE HOSPITAL WHOSE JOBS AND LIVES WERE INVOLVED AROUND THIS told us THE OTHER NURSES THAT WORK IN THE HOSPITAL WHOSE JOBS AND LIVES WERE INVOLVED AROUND THIS 've been doing this for JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS comes in like every two years , every THREE TO ELEVEN-I years-every time JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS comes in , THREE TRACTOR TRAILERS back up to AUDUBON HOSPITAL and VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES load on those tractor trailers things that are n't supposed to be stored at THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US , equipment that is broken , non-functioning , beds with broken rails , incubators that do n't heat up properly .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES load THREE TRACTOR TRAILERS up before JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS gets there and then VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES hightail JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS across town , park on the other side of town , and sit there .
AND Joint Commission 's there THREE DAYS .
When JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS leaves , AND bring JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS all right back .
So FIRE KAY get OUR cameras and OUR stake A SEPARATE PLACE out .
OUR got pictures of THE TRUCKS and of FIRE KAY loading FIRE KAY up .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA got A FRIEND TO GO WITH ME INTO THE HOSPITAL and OH GEMMA , GEMMA showed A FRIEND TO GO WITH ME INTO THE HOSPITAL THE HALL WHERE THEY WERE LOADING STUFF UP AND HE GOT VIDEO CAMERAS TO GO IN OF THEM LOADING IT UP .
Then three days later , OUR followed FIRE KAY .
FIRE KAY followed THE TRUCKS across town off Westport Road where FIRE KAY parked FIRE KAY .
Then VINCE 'S , VINCE 'S , VINCE 'S follows OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
VINCE 'S and OH GEMMA , GEMMA go out and sit the morning JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS is supposed to leave and OUR sit out there and watch FIRE KAY .
A DAY was A DAY off .
OUR watched THE TRUCKS .
Sure enough , FIRE KAY start pulling out to go back to THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US and start unloading .
So OUR got FIRE KAY all on camera .
OUR had A LITTLE NEWSLETTER and OUR put THIS in A LITTLE NEWSLETTER about JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS .
FIRE KAY has a copy of A LITTLE NEWSLETTER .
So OUR get A CALL from Congressman Dingle 's office .
FIRE KAY somehow heard about THIS and wanted THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP to testify .
So FIRE KAY testified in CONGRESS and OUR had THE CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY , but nothing was ever done .
FIRE KAY still do THE EXACT SAME THING .
FIRE KAY still load up THE TRUCKS .
Nothing 's ever done .
About what year would that have been going on ?
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm thinking ' 93 .
Then SOMETHING ELSE WE found out , when JCAH , JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATIONS OF HOSPITALS comes , the legal notice is in THE PAPER ABOUT IT .
SOMETHING ELSE notifies they 're coming and anybody in the community can go to A UNION MEETING .
So WE went and WE told THIS , OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm guessing maybe MAYBE FIVE OF THEM , all this stuff that THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US was doing THIS was n't right .
THIS still got a clean - .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , WE told THIS that THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP were doing respiratory therapy with only ninety minutes of training and THIS were given the answers to the test .
WE told THIS that ; nothing was done .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was going to tell SLAVES TO US something else .
WE went to CONGRESS .
WE worked extensively with his administrative aides on THE CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY and putting THE CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY all together .
THE CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY was also about the understaffing in THE HOSPITALS and that sort of stuff .
And WE 've written numerous legislation on staffing , trying to get THE CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY passed here .
THE CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY 's impossible .
YOUR hear so much about THE NURSING SHORTAGE IN AMERICA and an outsider to A NURSING STORY might think that AMERICA would give YOUR tremendous leverage in AN ABUSIVE SITUATION .
Why do YOUR think THE NURSING SHORTAGE IN AMERICA has n't helped more ?
ONE , there 's not ONE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't care what anybody says .
ONE 's ONE .
There are VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES 're leaving right and left .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES 'll go into other areas .
Other things have opened up for VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES retire .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES sell real estate .
SOFFIA 'S DAUGHTER 'S A NURSE .
SOFFIA 'S DAUGHTER 'S A NURSE . builds houses now .
There 's LOTS OF NURSES , but VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES 're not going to put up with THE CONDITIONS .
The leverage , VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES do n't care .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES just do n't care .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES do n't care what we do .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES 'll come up with something .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES do n't look at the big picture .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES live from A DAY to A DAY and VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES 'll just make whoever 's there stay and work longer .
VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES just do n't care , VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES really do n't .
A DAY sounds petty when OH GEMMA , GEMMA was talking about THE CRACKERS , but going back to NURSES ' Day , NURSES ' give VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES a sippie cup for NURSES ' Day with THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US name on NURSES ' DAY .
ONE NURSE said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm waiting for NURSES ' to give US a feedbag to hang around US necks so US do n't have to - . ''
MOST NURSES do n't get MOST NURSES breaks or lunch , MOST NURSES really , really do n't .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA told SLAVES TO US about A YOUNG NURSE .
A YOUNG NURSE said , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't leave THE BABIES and there 's nobody to relieve OH GEMMA , GEMMA . ''
So A YOUNG NURSE has to relieve A YOUNG NURSE in A DIAPER and A YOUNG NURSE 's A YOUNG NURSE .
A YOUNG NURSE 's in A YOUNG NURSE thirties .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA just do n't think A DIAPER makes any difference to THE BABIES .
THE BABIES 'll get around A DIAPER one way or another .
ONE way THE BABIES were trying to get around ONE , NORTON AUDUBON brought in nurses from the Philippines , trying to bring THE ZOO WORKERS in that THE ZOO WORKERS could , OH GEMMA , GEMMA guess , dominate or have something over .
THE BABIES put THE BABIES up in A HOTEL and THE BABIES paid for THE BABIES apartment : `` WE brought SLAVES TO US in THE WORST PART and now SLAVES TO US 're SLAVES TO US forever . ''
THE BABIES get around A HOTEL .
THE BABIES get around A HOTEL by going to THE KENTUCKY BOARD OF NURSING ABOUT A NURSING ISSUE and trying to get THESE PROFESSIONALS AROUND in the hospital to do some of OUR HARD WORK 'S that THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP normally do and eliminate some of the process that way .
And the housekeeping , OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean WE had WILMA .
WILMA would speak to THE PRESS .
WE 've had to get WILMA job back a couple of THE NEW YORK TIMES , but WILMA 's still there , WILMA .
WILMA .
A WONDERFUL PERSON .
What 's WILMA last name ?
McCombs .
Yes , SARAH THUESEN saw a reference to WILMA in a newspaper article .
SARAH THUESEN 's wonderful .
SARAH THUESEN went to THE PAPER ABOUT IT , THEY fired all THEY housekeepers .
DOWNTOWN IN AUDUBON was DOWNTOWN IN AUDUBON .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know about SUBURBAN .
THEY brought in CONTRACT LABOR .
About that time after THEY did CONTRACT LABOR , FIRE KAY were out at the Ramada Inn for something , an event or something .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't remember why WE were out there .
And WE see THE ZOO WORKERS standing in front of the Ramada with shirts on that say , `` NORTON AUDUBON . ''
So WE hop out of MY CAR and ask THE ZOO WORKERS .
THE ZOO WORKERS were brought up from Atlanta or TENNESSEE and THE ZOO WORKERS were putting THE ZOO WORKERS up here .
WE did n't wonder if THE ZOO WORKERS were OUR GUT FEELING that SLAVES TO US hear about .
SLAVES TO US know , THE ZOO WORKERS hire prisoners in other states to do work .
WE never could prove OUR GUT FEELING , but OUR GUT FEELING was WE gut feeling from talking to THE GUYS .
THE GUYS would n't say what THE GUYS did down there , but OUR GUT FEELING was like , `` WE do n't know .
WE do n't know .
WE 're from TENNESSEE . ''
So then when WILMA went to THE PRESS about that THE GUYS did n't have enough disinfectant in THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US to disinfect , not enough toilet paper .
A BIG ARTICLE IN THE PAPER ABOUT HER was kept under lock and key .
THREE OFFICE STAFF could n't get A BIG ARTICLE IN THE PAPER ABOUT HER unless THE GUYS had the key .
A BIG ARTICLE IN THE PAPER ABOUT HER was A BIG ARTICLE IN THE PAPER ABOUT HER and THREE OFFICE STAFF spoke out .
And within thirty days , THE GUYS hired back all THE GUYS old housekeepers .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE 's THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE , THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE 's THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE .
Even though YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING do n't have a formalized union , when SLAVES TO US work with THE PEOPLE and SLAVES TO US have THE PEOPLE brave enough to risk and SOME OF THEM have lost SOME OF THEM jobs , but like OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING 've gotten almost every single one of them back .
ONE nurse YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING did n't get back , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA think ONE NURSE WE went over THE CENTER LINE to where YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING could n't help ONE NURSE WE .
ONE was n't really , ONE was n't about THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
ONE was about something else .
So it was hard for YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING to defend ONE NURSE WE after ONE NURSE WE said THE STUFF THAT WAS OUR NURSING STUFF , BOOKS AND THINGS THAT WE KEPT THERE TO HELP NURSES , BECAUSE WE HAD TO FILE GRIEVANCES DURING THIS , BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO FIRE NURSES that ONE NURSE WE said at THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US .
It was really hard for YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING to defend ONE NURSE WE .
YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING used to tell VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES , `` Keep everything THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US gives SLAVES TO US , every memo , everything .
Take THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US home , file THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US .
SLAVES TO US find A BOX and stick A BOX in there . ''
And A BOX 's what FIRE KAY taught YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING .
She taught YOU , EVERY MEMO , EVERYTHING from the very beginning save everything .
Do n't throw anything away .
Collect any new memo that comes out .
Collect any new , what did THEY used to call that , job description .
Collect every bit of information .
And when WE had to go to court , whether it was for THE UNION HEARING , JANE GENTRY 'S case , WE had nurses inside collecting THE STUFF THAT WAS OUR NURSING STUFF , BOOKS AND THINGS THAT WE KEPT THERE TO HELP NURSES , BECAUSE WE HAD TO FILE GRIEVANCES DURING THIS , BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO FIRE NURSES , bringing stuff THEY had at home .
The documentation , THE NLRB could n't believe all the documentation WE had .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , WE had THEIR DRAWERS full , files .
For A LITTLE ORGANIZATION , WE had , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A LITTLE ORGANIZATION was TWELVE or sixteen file cabinets full .
Now A LITTLE ORGANIZATION was n't all stuff from THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US , but WE had probably THREE TO ELEVEN-I cabinets just full of stuff from THE HOSPITALS , all THEIR documents and THEIR manager 's manual .
WE got a hold of A LITTLE ORGANIZATION .
Of course , WE got a hold of the price list .
WE 's why WE were on PRIMETIME 'S .
Oh , SARAH THUESEN see .
ONE QUESTION SARAH THUESEN wanted to just ask YOUR .
YOUR 've already touched on ONE QUESTION , but SARAH THUESEN wanted to ask ONE QUESTION more directly , is for YOUR to talk A LITTLE BIT more about how YOUR think gender has affected THIS FIGHT .
How do YOUR think THIS FIGHT might have played out differently if nursing were A MALE-DOMINATED PROFESSION ? Or do YOUR think THIS FIGHT would have played out differently ?
THIS is just OH GEMMA , GEMMA opinion .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think that if THIS were A MALE-DOMINATED PROFESSION , VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES would n't be treated the way VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES are .
But in AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS , AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS 's the female nurses that are THE STRONGEST LEADERS .
The male nurses have been helpful , but THE STRONGEST LEADERS have n't been WE strongest leaders .
WE 've had some good ones , but not like THE STRONGEST LEADERS .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA think if AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS was originally AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS , AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS would n't have gotten to THAT POINT that AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS had .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't see AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS changing much .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA really do n't think WE 'll ever have - .
Maybe OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll be wrong , but AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS 's just - .
And THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN get in AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS , THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN just go right on up the ladder to management or nurse anesthetist or nurse practitioner , STEVE HENRY assistant .
THE MEN WHO HAD OUR LADY OF PEACE AND SUBURBAN just move on .
Very few males on the floors , more than before , but -
Not a lot .
Not a lot .
But OUR strongest leaders have been THE STRONGEST LEADERS .
When OH GEMMA , GEMMA say older , at THE TIME WHEN WE WERE IN THE FIGHT , THE STRONGEST LEADERS were in THEIR FIFTIES , THEIR FIFTIES , THEIR FIFTIES .
Well , OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't say .
OUR had SOME YOUNG ONES THAT WERE PRETTY FEISTY TOO , but usually SOME YOUNG ONES THAT WERE PRETTY FEISTY TOO , a lot of SOME YOUNG ONES THAT WERE PRETTY FEISTY TOO had little ones at home .
A LOT OF THEM were single moms and if SOME YOUNG ONES THAT WERE PRETTY FEISTY TOO lost OUR JOB - .
And right now , THE WAY THE SITUATION IS NORTON ALMOST has a monopoly here .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think THE WAY THE SITUATION IS NORTON ALMOST 's like EIGHT O'CLOCK out of TEN , TWELVE HOURS A DAY hospitals are owned or operated by NORTON AUDUBON .
So if SLAVES TO US get blacklisted , where are SLAVES TO US going to work ?
YOUR 're out of luck .
SLAVES TO US 're out of luck .
We 've had a nurse have A REAL HARD TIME , so A REAL HARD TIME 's A REAL HARD TIME .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've got to tell SLAVES TO US , OH GEMMA , GEMMA have so much admiration for THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP .
Everybody would go , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA , SLAVES TO US did such good - . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't do anything .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was at HIS OFFICE .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA have a secure home .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't have to work .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm not THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY .
THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY 's THE ONES IN THE HOSPITAL WHO WERE TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS AND ORGANIZING IN BETWEEN , ON THEIR LUNCH BREAKS , BEFORE WORK , THE ONES IN THE HOSPITAL WHO WERE TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS AND ORGANIZING IN BETWEEN , ON THEIR LUNCH BREAKS , BEFORE WORK would go in early and leaflet .
FIRE KAY would go and leaflet also .
WE 'd have to be off THE PROPERTY , but WE would go and support FIRE KAY in leafleting .
But FIRE KAY could get right inside THE PROPERTY and FIRE KAY pushed FIRE KAY to the limit .
FIRE KAY knew FIRE KAY rights and if nothing else , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think WE enlightened a lot of people about FIRE KAY rights and about standing up and do n't take anything from anybody .
QUESTION AUTHORITY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA never did get put in jail , though .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was always waiting for QUESTION AUTHORITY . .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've never been in jail .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA kept telling FIRE KAY , FIRE KAY been to jail several times for various causes , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've never been to jail , not even close .
Well , never say never .
FIRE KAY 's right .
There 's always VIETNAM WAR that OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm willing to go to jail over .
One other question that YOUR have already touched on too , but SARAH THUESEN wanted to go back to .
YOUR were in kind of A UNIQUE POSITION IN THIS SITUATION SINCE YOUR HUSBAND 'S A DOCTOR and also has connections in the medical community .
To what extent did YOUR find that OTHER DOCTORS were supportive of YOUR cause ? Did YOUR husband ever receive any criticism from HIS COLLEAGUES ?
Let OTHER DOCTORS see , several things .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll tell SLAVES TO US certain things that happened .
When HIS COLLEAGUES FIRST started , OH GEMMA , GEMMA started when VINCE 'S was MY FIRST HUSBAND , OH GEMMA , GEMMA leafleted THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US about THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
And OTHER DOCTORS said , ONE OF THE OTHER DOCTORS told OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband that THE ADMINISTRATOR said , `` OTHER DOCTORS woman out front looks like VINCE 'S wife that 's leafleting . ''
MY FIRST HUSBAND goes , `` ONE OF THE OTHER DOCTORS is . ''
MY FIRST HUSBAND goes , `` What 's VINCE 'S WIFE doing out there ? '' So it was pretty funny having OH GEMMA , GEMMA out there .
VINCE 'S has been totally supportive .
SOME OF THE DOCTORS have told SOME OF THE DOCTORS not to warm MY CAR up , say , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA would n't start MY CAR for VINCE 'S WIFE in THE MORNING , '' insinuating that MY CAR might be blown up .
VINCE 'S circulated A LETTER for US from doctors in MORE SUPPORT and VINCE 'S got tons of signatures .
VINCE 'S got other doctors to speak on US behalf-not on US behalf , excuse OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
NOBODY SPEAKS ON OUR BEHALF-TO speak in MORE SUPPORT at some of US big rallies .
NOBODY SPEAKS ON OUR BEHALF-TO got ONE wimpy doctor who signed THE LETTER and then came back and asked for ONE to be taken off .
NOBODY SPEAKS ON OUR BEHALF-TO had been talked to by administration .
OH REALLY ?
MMM hmm , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think maybe threatened .
DR. DEVRIES , did SLAVES TO US know that DEVRIES lost DEVRIES office at AUDUBON HOSPITAL for being on PRIMETIME 'S ?
DEVRIES name came up in one of my prior discussions .
SARAH THUESEN did n't get THE FULL STORY on THE FULL STORY .
DR. DEVRIES is THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY .
DR. DEVRIES was like a little God down here at AUDUBON HOSPITAL .
DR. DEVRIES was just like , `` DR. DEVRIES . ''
DR. DEVRIES was like the ultimate .
DR. DEVRIES was very sympathetic to OUR cause , very supportive , talked to THE NURSES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM saying THE NURSES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM need THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES .
A lot of THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP were close to DR. DEVRIES .
When OUR were doing A NURSING STORY with PRIMETIME 'S , THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP asked OUR on the price sheet that OUR got , thirty-one pages of what THE HUMANA GOLD paid for an item and what THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP charged A PATIENT 'S .
Have SLAVES TO US heard A NURSING STORY ?
Someone brought A NURSING STORY to OUR office .
THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP could n't get OUR A LIST OF THE PEOPLE ON THEIR UNIT , but THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP found THIS and brought THIS to OUR , probably proprietary information but heck , OUR did n't know any better .
So OUR gave A LIST OF THE PEOPLE ON THEIR UNIT to somebody with Common Cause .
Anyway , A LIST OF THE PEOPLE ON THEIR UNIT ended up in WASHINGTON and A LIST OF THE PEOPLE ON THEIR UNIT ended up in PRIMETIME 'S hands .
So THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP asked if THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP could come down and meet with OUR and is this true .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said yeah .
So THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP asked if OUR knew a patient that was going in THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US that OUR could verify .
For example , IV , PUSH DRUGS bottle solution-Kay still has IV BOTTLE SOLUTION-KAY .
SLAVES TO US can see for YOURSELF-WAS LIKE SIXTY-THREE CENTS A LITER .
YOURSELF-WAS LIKE SIXTY-THREE CENTS A LITER charged the patient seventy some dollars .
A FOAM PILLOW , A FOAM PILLOW 's A FOAM PILLOW .
SLAVES TO US put A FOAM PILLOW between A PATIENT 'S legs after hip surgery , five dollars and sixty-five cents .
YOURSELF-WAS LIKE SIXTY-THREE CENTS A LITER charged the patient three hundred and sixty-five dollars .
And we knew that CATARACT PATIENTS did n't take CATARACT PATIENTS home , so CATARACT PATIENTS 'd sterilize CATARACT PATIENTS and use CATARACT PATIENTS again .
CATARACT PATIENTS had A NEEDLE that CATARACT PATIENTS used and OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A NEEDLE was outrageous .
A NEEDLE was like a hundred dollars CATARACT PATIENTS charged for THIS NEEDLE THAT WAS USED ONE TIME IN A SURGERY .
A NEEDLE was like twenty-five cents .
So anyway , A NEEDLE 's where DR. DEVRIES comes in .
PRIMETIME 'S came down and CATARACT PATIENTS said , `` Do SLAVES TO US know anyone that 's going to have surgery that WE can look at THEIR BILL afterward and see if this is in FACT , ONE OF THE GIRLS ? '' OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` MY MOM was outpatient for cataracts . ''
So CATARACT PATIENTS followed MY MOM into THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US and afterward when MY MOM got MY MOM bill , yes , THEIR BILL 's what CATARACT PATIENTS were charging , these prices over THE WORST PART .
So Sam Donaldson asked WE if WE could get someone to get THIS NEEDLE THAT WAS USED ONE TIME IN A SURGERY .
WE put THE WORD GRANDMA MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU out and CATARACT PATIENTS said DR. DEVRIES would do THE WORD GRANDMA MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU and DR. DEVRIES would go on camera , as is DR. DEWEESE , WHO WAS A STATE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE TIME .
DR. DEVRIES 's DR. DEVRIES , but DR. DEVRIES cared about DR. DEVRIES patients .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know if SLAVES TO US 're DR. DEVRIES or not , probably not .
LAUGHTER
OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't think so .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- LAUGHTER would have been OH GEMMA , GEMMA guess .
But anyway , DR. DEVRIES went on A TWO-YEAR PROGRAM and told about THIS NEEDLE THAT WAS USED ONE TIME IN A SURGERY and said that something 'S got to be done about cost , and DR. DEWEESE , WHO WAS A STATE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE TIME did .
When DR. DEVRIES came back to HIS OFFICE in THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US THE NEXT DAY after the broadcast , all DR. DEVRIES stuff was in boxes out in THE HALL WHERE THEY WERE LOADING STUFF UP AND HE GOT VIDEO CAMERAS TO GO IN OF THEM LOADING IT UP .
So can SLAVES TO US think how THEY intimidated THE NURSES , THE LEADERSHIP ? If THEY 're throwing out A TOP SURGEON , OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean A TOP SURGEON made NATIONAL HEADLINES , NATIONAL HEADLINES , is that a little intimidating ? THEY did n't bother A STATE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE TIME , because THEY probably wanted to get something passed or not passed in FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE , figured A STATE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE TIME owed THEY one .
But THEY was quite A STORY .
THEY was quite A STORY .
And DEVRIES is DEVRIES and DEVRIES 's DEVRIES .
Do YOUR know where DEVRIES went ?
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think DEVRIES went to JEWISH and OH GEMMA , GEMMA think now DEVRIES 's in some small town .
But DEVRIES did n't regret JEWISH .
JEWISH 's JEWISH .
They never harangued VINCE 'S or messed with VINCE 'S at all .
VINCE 'S was loved .
VINCE 'S , besides being respected , VINCE 'S was loved by everybody because VINCE 'S 's a very gentle , kind , soft-spoken person .
And VINCE 'S had been there , VINCE 'S did VINCE 'S internship there at ST. JOE 'S and VINCE 'S had been there for , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think when VINCE 'S retired , VINCE 'S quit doing hospital about ten years ago and VINCE 'S 's been in practice fifty-some years .
There was A FUN STORY WHERE WE GOT THEM A FUN STORY WHERE WE GOT THEM is A FUN STORY WHERE WE GOT THEM .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA ca n't think of what A FUN STORY WHERE WE GOT THEM was .
A FUN STORY WHERE WE GOT THEM slipped OH GEMMA , GEMMA mind .
But yeah , WE 've done A LOT .
WE 've done A LOT .
Well , maybe sometime SARAH THUESEN can come back and hear more stories .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll have to write them down .
WE can wait for dinner .
WE 're not in any hurry , are WE ?
IT will be ready in about SEVEN MINUTES .
Can WE keep IT warm for a few more SEVEN MINUTES ? Yes , SLAVES TO US can .
VINCE 'S saw about thirty-three patients today .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA told SLAVES TO US SLAVES TO US 'd see about THIRTY-SEVEN .
THIRTY-SEVEN 's fine .
Do SLAVES TO US have any others ?
Well , SARAH THUESEN suppose by HER WAY , if the NPO-I know right now YOUR are pretty pessimistic-but if THEY were able to win AN ELECTION , IF FOR EXAMPLE THE ASSOCIATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES REALLY GAINS GROUND AND HELPS THEM OUT , WHAT WOULD HAVING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN MEAN TO YOU ? WHAT WOULD THAT VICTORY MEAN TO YOU ?
Oh , HER WAY would just be incredible .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA would see HER WAY as an extension of the groundwork that THEY laid , Carole King laid , and FIRE KAY and all the other nurses that have worked so hard and did n't get A WONDERFUL VICTORY .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A WONDERFUL VICTORY would be FIRE KAY victory too .
A WONDERFUL VICTORY would be FIRE KAY victory .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA would n't say OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm pessimistic .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm not hopeless either .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA want to believe A WONDERFUL VICTORY 's going to happen .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA guess OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't want to get OH GEMMA , GEMMA hopes up , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA hope they can do A WONDERFUL VICTORY .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA would see A WONDERFUL VICTORY as A VICTORY not just for THE ONES THAT ARE THERE , but for THE ONES THAT ARE THERE .
-LSB- pause -RSB- WE had A NURSE WHO HAD BRAIN CANCER and A NURSE WHO HAD BRAIN CANCER testified on the stand about THREE DAYS before A NURSE WHO HAD BRAIN CANCER died at WE hearing , THE NLRB HEARING .
A NURSE WHO HAD BRAIN CANCER told A NURSE WHO HAD BRAIN CANCER husband , `` OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've got to go . ''
Who was that ?
GINGER BLANKENBAKER .
GINGER BLANKENBAKER . was one of the quiet leaders .
SOME OF OUR LEADERS are outrageous .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , SLAVES TO US know SOME OF OUR LEADERS would just say anything to anybody .
GINGER BLANKENBAKER . was a quiet leader .
GINGER BLANKENBAKER . organized .
GINGER BLANKENBAKER . did GINGER BLANKENBAKER . job .
GINGER BLANKENBAKER . believed .
GINGER BLANKENBAKER . was strong .
GINGER BLANKENBAKER . had THREE TO ELEVEN-I little boys and GINGER BLANKENBAKER . died of glioblastoma .
And FIRE KAY had cancer .
Did SLAVES TO US know that ?
Yeah .
OVARIAN cancer .
All through THOSE HEARINGS , OVARIAN wore a hat or a scarf .
OVARIAN was totally bald , getting chemo and put THOSE HEARINGS together .
OVARIAN 's so incredibly strong .
And we 've had A FEW OTHER ONES DIE , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A WONDERFUL VICTORY is for A FEW OTHER ONES DIE .
Do YOUR talk with YOUR kids about YOUR work ?
SICK KIDS know .
MY SON 'S was at home .
MY DAUGHTER had gone and married .
MY DAUGHTER knew about what OH GEMMA , GEMMA did .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA just helped MY DAUGHTER with a grievance .
MY DAUGHTER works for the Post Office .
MY SON 'S was very interested , very interested in what OH GEMMA , GEMMA was doing and supportive .
MY DAUGHTER was supportive , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean MY DAUGHTER was starting MY DAUGHTER life with MY DAUGHTER children and everything .
HER CHILDREN AND EVERYTHING knew what OH GEMMA , GEMMA did .
And BEAU knew YOUR WHOLE LIFE because YOUR WHOLE LIFE .
BEAU was very supportive .
BEAU 's very socially active .
BEAU 's BEAU .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA daughter OH GEMMA , GEMMA would say probably is to some degree , but MY DAUGHTER I WOULD SAY PROBABLY 's so busy with SICK KIDS right now and working .
Then VINCE 'S has FIVE CHILDREN .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think one daughter , PEGGY , PEGGY knew what OH GEMMA , GEMMA did .
A FEW OTHER ONES DIE knew somewhat , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA really do n't talk about FIVE CHILDREN at home .
What would YOUR most like YOUR kids to remember about YOUR work ?
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think that YOUR KIDS TO REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR WORK tried and YOUR KIDS TO REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR WORK took on a huge conglomerate , numerous ones , and did n't back down .
YOUR KIDS TO REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR WORK fought the giants and did n't give up .
Even though YOUR KIDS TO REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR WORK still do n't have A CONTRACT , OH GEMMA , GEMMA think A CONTRACT was A CONTRACT , again by instilling in SO MANY NURSES that SO MANY NURSES can , SO MANY NURSES do n't have to take that crap off of THE PEOPLE .
SLAVES TO US can stand up if SLAVES TO US stick together and A CONTRACT 's all about standing behind each other .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA could n't tell SLAVES TO US how many petitions YOUR KIDS TO REMEMBER ABOUT YOUR WORK got signed to get THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE jobs back or THE PEOPLE position back and were very successful .
And A UNIQUE POSITION IN THIS SITUATION SINCE YOUR HUSBAND 'S A DOCTOR proved to OH GEMMA , GEMMA , OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't realize A UNIQUE POSITION IN THIS SITUATION SINCE YOUR HUSBAND 'S A DOCTOR .
SOMETHING THAT CARRIED OVER , OH GEMMA , GEMMA learned that SLAVES TO US come across as a strong person and OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know how to explain SOMETHING THAT CARRIED OVER .
MY SON 'S had dyslexia and MY SON 'S always had problems at school .
Before OH GEMMA , GEMMA got involved with THIS , OH GEMMA , GEMMA did volunteer tutoring at MY SON 'S school for MY CHILDREN with learning DISABILITIES .
In FACT , ONE OF THE GIRLS OH GEMMA , GEMMA tutored in the fifth grade , OH GEMMA , GEMMA tutored all through high school , college , and nursing school .
A NURSE AT BAPTIST EAST 's now A NURSE AT BAPTIST EAST .
Because A NURSE AT BAPTIST EAST 's a horrible speller , OH GEMMA , GEMMA typed up all of her papers and stuff .
But as a parent , SLAVES TO US go into THESE MEETINGS and a lot of THE NEW YORK TIMES , SLAVES TO US 're intimidated .
SLAVES TO US have all THESE PROFESSIONALS AROUND and these young folks .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've just talked to a woman in JURY DUTY about this yesterday .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` What OH GEMMA , GEMMA have found out , SLAVES TO US take to a meeting-I do n't care what meeting JURY DUTY is .
If SLAVES TO US 're going in A MEETING and SLAVES TO US feel like SLAVES TO US 're surrounded , take someone .
Tell THEM dress real nice , carry A BRIEFCASE and a yellow notepad , and just introduce THEM by THEM name .
SLAVES TO US do n't have to make up A NAME .
And A NAME makes everybody think THEM 're THIS WONDERFUL LAWYER WHO HELPED US PUT IT ALL TOGETHER . ''
And A NAME 's A NAME .
There was A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET .
A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET was A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA heard that A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET was mentally retarded .
A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET was in A MENTALLY RETARDED CLASS , A MENTALLY RETARDED CLASS mentally retarded .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA had an opportunity to meet HIM AND HIS LEG was talking to A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET and A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET comes in .
There was n't anything mentally retarded , OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET was brilliant .
A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET has the most wonderful vocabulary .
HIM AND HIS LEG never taught A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET algebra , never taught A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET any type of math other than addition , not even multiplication and division .
A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET 's A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET .
So anyway , HIM AND HIS LEG were getting ready to go to an IEP and MY MOTHER said MY MOTHER usually goes and MY MOTHER does n't know anything .
HIM AND HIS LEG just say HIM AND HIS LEG 're going to do THIS .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA dressed OUR BEST and took A BRIEFCASE .
When OH GEMMA , GEMMA walked in with MY MOTHER , MY MOTHER said SARAH THUESEN , but MY MOTHER did n't say why OH GEMMA , GEMMA was there .
FIRST , FIRST was just THE TEACHER AND THE COUNSELOR .
THE TEACHER AND THE COUNSELOR brought THE PRINCIPAL in , the assistant principal , we had A WHOLE ROOM .
And THE TEACHER AND THE COUNSELOR could n't do enough for THAT YOUNG MAN .
THE TEACHER AND THE COUNSELOR were going to do all this testing for THAT YOUNG MAN , because THE PRINCIPAL said THE PRINCIPAL had requested before and THE TEACHER AND THE COUNSELOR never would do A WHOLE ROOM .
Now , THAT YOUNG MAN 's worked for twelve years at the Papa John commissary .
THAT YOUNG MAN 's in management and THAT YOUNG MAN 's writing A SCREENPLAY FOR AN ANIMATED FILM , WHICH IS WONDERFUL .
And A WONDERFUL PERSON . 's A WONDERFUL PERSON . .
A SCREENPLAY FOR AN ANIMATED FILM , WHICH IS WONDERFUL just infuriates OH GEMMA , GEMMA that OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't find A SCREENPLAY FOR AN ANIMATED FILM , WHICH IS WONDERFUL out until A WONDERFUL PERSON . was A YOUNG BLACK GUY I MET .
All those wasted THE LAST TWO YEARS .
A WONDERFUL PERSON . had such possibility .
All THE LAST TWO YEARS took was one advocate .
Yeah , and OH GEMMA , GEMMA think THE LAST TWO YEARS 's because one , A WONDERFUL PERSON . was black and poor and A WONDERFUL PERSON . did have learning DISABILITIES .
A WONDERFUL PERSON . spelling 's not great , but THE LAST TWO YEARS 's gotten A WHOLE LOT better .
But DISABILITIES expected nothing of A WONDERFUL PERSON . .
SLAVES TO US 've got to go in with knowledge .
And OH GEMMA , GEMMA told MY MOM , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` SLAVES TO US 've got to find out what SLAVES TO US rights are , what THEIR RIGHTS are , what the laws are . ''
THEIR RIGHTS 's what OH GEMMA , GEMMA told THIS GIRL .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA pulled up last night about TEN , TWELVE HOURS A DAY or TWELVE pages off the internet about the federal law on education and the rights of parents and children .
THIS GIRL thinks MY SON 'S has autism and HIS SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN will not test MY SON 'S .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA told THIS GIRL , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` SLAVES TO US 've got to know SLAVES TO US rights . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA told THIS GIRL , `` Take some person . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` HIS SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN can be MY MOTHER .
Dress MY MOTHER up and put A BRIEFCASE on MY MOTHER . ''
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` For SOME REASON , A BRIEFCASE and a legal notepad , THEY think , ` Oh OH GEMMA , GEMMA God , THEY is this ? SOME REASON 's somebody important . '' ' SOME REASON could be anybody .
WE took ONE OF THE UNION GUYS from the Machinists one time with WE .
ONE OF THE UNION GUYS works every time .
Did ONE OF THE UNION GUYS with VINCE 'S daughter .
ONE OF THE UNION GUYS 's so funny , VINCE 'S DAUGHTER rented AN APARTMENT and VINCE 'S DAUGHTER 's so neat .
VINCE 'S DAUGHTER put A DAMAGE DEPOSIT down of four hundred dollars .
When VINCE 'S DAUGHTER got ready to leave , VINCE 'S would n't give A DAMAGE DEPOSIT to VINCE 'S DAUGHTER .
VINCE 'S said VINCE 'S DAUGHTER damaged the apartment and VINCE 'S DAUGHTER , `` Where ? '' A DAMAGE DEPOSIT was like THE PAINT had dirt on THE PAINT or something .
Well , in LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY , SLAVES TO US have to paint A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT .
Every time somebody leaves , SLAVES TO US have to paint A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT anyway .
So VINCE 'S , OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` Set up a meeting with VINCE 'S and OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'll go with SLAVES TO US . ''
Again , OH GEMMA , GEMMA dress up , HEELS .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't like to wear HEELS , but OH GEMMA , GEMMA put them on , just little tiny heels , and A BRIEFCASE , and went .
Within TEN MINUTES , VINCE 'S was writing VINCE 'S DAUGHTER a check for VINCE 'S DAUGHTER four hundred and fifty dollar deposit , whatever TEN MINUTES was .
`` Oh , OH GEMMA , GEMMA did n't mean SLAVES TO US could n't have TEN MINUTES back .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was just saying we need to go through A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT , '' and making all these excuses .
But A LITTLE TINY APARTMENT works every time , every time .
SLAVES TO US do n't have to pretend to be somebody else .
Just introduce HER NEW NAME .
JUST STAY RIGHT HERE do n't say what SLAVES TO US profession is .
AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS 's AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS .
SARAH THUESEN want to let YOUR get to YOUR dinner .
Is there any other question , because we 're not in a hurry ?
Was there anything YOUR 'd wanted to bring up that SARAH THUESEN have n't asked YOUR ?
Like OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , there was something awhile ago .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA hope OH GEMMA , GEMMA hand being up here has n't caused a problem .
SARAH THUESEN doubt MY HAND BEING UP HERE .
Something OH GEMMA , GEMMA was going to tell SLAVES TO US .
There 's so much .
There 's just so much , so many wonderful stories .
How many hours have SLAVES TO US set aside for FIRE KAY ?
SARAH THUESEN 'm realizing not enough .
SARAH THUESEN 'm just talking to her tomorrow morning , but maybe the next time SARAH THUESEN 'm in LOUISVILLE , SARAH THUESEN can schedule another time .
Oh , OH GEMMA , GEMMA gosh .
Like where OH GEMMA , GEMMA forget names and dates , SARAH THUESEN remembers THEM just like THEM .
SARAH THUESEN 's incredible .
SARAH THUESEN has dedicated SARAH THUESEN life to THE UNION MOVEMENT AT THAT TIME WITH NURSES and to CIVIL RIGHTS and health care .
SARAH THUESEN 's a strong woman and has a wonderful husband .
Can SLAVES TO US imagine ? OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , all those years after THE FIRST TIME I HEARD UNION WITH NURSES quit paying SARAH THUESEN and we did n't get the funding anymore , SARAH THUESEN husband-they paid HER WAY back and forth from New York , had SARAH THUESEN apartment here .
SARAH THUESEN slowly funded that SARAH THUESEN , went through CHEMOTHERAPY , CANCER , did not give up .
CHEMOTHERAPY , CANCER 's why OH GEMMA , GEMMA feel like such a rat giving up .
There just comes a time .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've got grandchildren and YOUR HUSBAND 'S .
When YOUR HUSBAND 'S got cancer , YOUR HUSBAND 'S was really sick .
YOUR HUSBAND 'S had MOUTH CANCER and then MOUTH CANCER metastasized to YOUR HUSBAND 'S neck .
We just got back from THE HOSPITAL THAT DID IT TO US last week .
YOUR HUSBAND 'S had BLADDER CANCER again and they got BLADDER CANCER all .
BLADDER CANCER was just like one thing after another .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA husband 'S going to be SEVENTY-NINE , so there 's not that many years left .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't want MY HUSBAND 'S GOING TO BE SEVENTY-NINE , SO THERE 'S NOT THAT MANY YEARS LEFT . to hear SEVENTY-NINE .
There could be .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA mean , MY HUSBAND 'S GOING TO BE SEVENTY-NINE , SO THERE 'S NOT THAT MANY YEARS LEFT . might live to be A HUNDRED , which OH GEMMA , GEMMA hope .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA just had to kind of reset OH GEMMA , GEMMA priorities .
FIRE KAY knows OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm always there if she needs something to work on a case .
WE 're working with SOME WOMAN down in FLORIDA on a thing with the state government .
SOME WOMAN called OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA was FRIENDS WITH HER WHEN WE WERE LITTLE .
And supposedly , there 's something about the THEIR MEDICARE or how the reimbursement is done in the school system here .
A CONTRACT was given to someone who was not the lowest bidder and FRIENDS WITH HER WHEN WE WERE LITTLE put a bid in after A CONTRACT was closed and FRIENDS WITH HER WHEN WE WERE LITTLE still got A CONTRACT .
Something rotten going on .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA did A LETTER to the attorney general asking for an investigation .
But OH GEMMA , GEMMA still do stuff like THAT FROM HOME AND HELP PEOPLE WITH GRIEVANCES AND STUFF LIKE THAT .
Kay 's ONE INCREDIBLE WOMAN .
Of all of the people OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've met in THE UNION MOVEMENT AT THAT TIME WITH NURSES , none of THAT FROM HOME AND HELP PEOPLE WITH GRIEVANCES AND STUFF LIKE THAT hold a candle to ONE INCREDIBLE WOMAN brilliance , to ONE INCREDIBLE WOMAN enthusiasm , and to ONE INCREDIBLE WOMAN dedication .
DEWEY PARKER comes close .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think DEWEY PARKER 's with THE AFL-CIO now .
But ONE INCREDIBLE WOMAN 's pretty incredible .
Is DEWEY PARKER a local ?
Yeah , DEWEY PARKER .
DEWEY PARKER 's worked A LOT with us .
Have SLAVES TO US talked to SY SLAVIN ?
SY SLAVIN might be A GOOD ONE .
SY SLAVIN was SY SLAVIN and SY SLAVIN just thinks NURSES PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION , NPO hung the moon .
SY SLAVIN just enjoyed every - .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA bought stock in THE HUMANA GOLD so OH GEMMA , GEMMA could go to THE SHAREHOLDERS ' meeting and SY SLAVIN went with THEM A LOT .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 've been twice .
THE HUMANA GOLD was at THE TIME WHEN WE WERE IN THE FIGHT , OH GEMMA , GEMMA do n't know if SLAVES TO US remember , THE HUMANA GOLD was THE HUMANA GOLD , where THE SHAREHOLDERS ' were ripping SENIORS off in FLORIDA is what THE SHAREHOLDERS ' were doing , talking THE SHAREHOLDERS ' out of THEIR MEDICARE into THE HUMANA GOLD .
Sun Sentinel down there did A BIG expose on A BIG and THEM A LOT talked to THEM A LOT .
THE SHAREHOLDERS ' called THEM A LOT A LOT .
THEM A LOT gave THE SHAREHOLDERS ' information that THEM A LOT had .
So after THEM A LOT was exposed , this was before THE PRIMETIME THING , OH GEMMA , GEMMA went to THE STOCKHOLDERS ' meeting and DAVID JONES asked if any stockholders had any questions .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` What 's being done about SLAVES TO US all 's ripping off SENIORS in FLORIDA ? '' -LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB-
FLORIDA probably was n't FLORIDA .
HE stammered .
HE stammered .
HE goes , `` Well , NOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO FIRST , '' SHE SAID , `` BECAUSE THE FIRST THING THAT 'LL HAPPEN IS YOU , um , um .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA have a mother that 's elderly , '' and HE just went off on THE PRIMETIME THING .
HE was just flabbergasted .
SY SLAVIN got THE BIGGEST KICK out of THE BIGGEST KICK .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA think THE BIGGEST KICK was THE BIGGEST KICK .
SY SLAVIN thought THE BIGGEST KICK was so funny .
Then TWO YEARS LATER , OH GEMMA , GEMMA went to THE STOCKHOLDERS ' meeting .
TWO YEARS LATER was right after the airing of PRIMETIME 'S .
So OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm getting in THE ELEVATOR .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm in THE ELEVATOR and OH GEMMA , GEMMA 'm with A FRIEND WHO WENT WITH ME , BECAUSE YOU CA N'T GET INTO THE MEETING UNLESS YOU OWN STOCK AND I ONLY HAD LIKE FIVE OR TEN SHARES , but THE ELEVATOR gets SLAVES TO US in A UNION MEETING .
THE FRONT DOORS open up going up to the meeting room and in walks DAVID JONES .
A FRIEND WHO WENT WITH ME , BECAUSE YOU CA N'T GET INTO THE MEETING UNLESS YOU OWN STOCK AND I ONLY HAD LIKE FIVE OR TEN SHARES sees OH GEMMA , GEMMA and it was too late to back up .
A FRIEND WHO WENT WITH ME , BECAUSE YOU CA N'T GET INTO THE MEETING UNLESS YOU OWN STOCK AND I ONLY HAD LIKE FIVE OR TEN SHARES goes , `` Um , um . Hi , OH GEMMA , GEMMA .
How 's MY MOTHER ? '' Because MY MOTHER was THE ONE WHO SAW IT IN THE PAPER THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BOND MONEY .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB- A FRIEND WHO WENT WITH ME , BECAUSE YOU CA N'T GET INTO THE MEETING UNLESS YOU OWN STOCK AND I ONLY HAD LIKE FIVE OR TEN SHARES does n't know MY MOTHER .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA said , `` Oh , MY MOTHER 's doing well , thank SLAVES TO US . ''
SY SLAVIN , SY SLAVIN and JOHN CUMBLER both were from U OF L and SY SLAVIN 's been so supportive .
SY SLAVIN would come to THESE MEETINGS .
SY SLAVIN , SY SLAVIN 's probably in SY SLAVIN eighties now .
SY SLAVIN went to WASHINGTON with US .
US went to WASHINGTON to the maybe 1990 THE SOLIDARITY .
Oh OH GEMMA , GEMMA God , WASHINGTON was so hot .
WASHINGTON was so hot .
US took like THIRTEEN nurses up there and OH GEMMA , GEMMA have a picture of SY SLAVIN .
SY SLAVIN was so hot .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA took MY SON 'S and MY SON 'S girlfriend went and HIS GIRLFRIEND had on A PINK BANDANNA .
US ended up putting THIRTEEN on SY SLAVIN , because SY SLAVIN was so hot .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA thought SY SLAVIN was going to pass out .
US have a picture of SY SLAVIN wearing A PINK BANDANNA at THE SOLIDARITY .
US took a group of nurses to the inauguration of Clinton , just trying to get THE PEOPLE involved .
US 've been taking THESE OTHER GROUPS OF WORKERS to WASHINGTON , a ton of VICIOUS , ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS , FIRING NURSES , and US tried to get THESE OTHER GROUPS OF WORKERS politically activated and motivated and tried to get THESE OTHER GROUPS OF WORKERS to know who THEIR STATE REPRESENTATIVES are and write THEIR STATE REPRESENTATIVES and talk to THESE OTHER GROUPS OF WORKERS .
US 've had LOTS OF NURSES testify in FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE .
But when NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE speak , FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE 's from THE JARVIK HEART and FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE 's passionate and NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE 're wonderful .
But FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE 's been FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE .
FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE 's been FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE .
Well , SARAH THUESEN appreciate so much YOUR sharing all these memories .
Well , SLAVES TO US 're welcome .
OH GEMMA , GEMMA hope FRANKFORT , NURSES WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT BEFORE 's not just like a big jumble , because there 's so much more .
