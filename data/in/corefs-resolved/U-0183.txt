THE CITY , ALL THIS just felt that way whether THE BLACKS HERE did THE CITY , ALL THIS or not .
THE CITY , ALL THIS felt like-it made AN OLD PERSON feel real small because AN OLD PERSON go somewhere and AN OLD PERSON see NEGRO bathroom , white bathroom .
WE 're all in the same wash room .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like what 's the difference in NEGRO BATHROOMS , really .
If WE can stand HERE SIDE by side and wash WE hands why ca n't WE utilize the same bath-which OK MRS. ENGLISH used to do .

OK MRS. ENGLISH 'd just go right on and use A DIME TO USE THE BATHROOM , LIKE A DIME ? .
A DIME TO USE THE BATHROOM , LIKE A DIME ? used to be real funny because THEY ALL had a lot of RELATIVES THAT USED TO WORK AT BELK 'S AT THAT TIME IN THE CAFETERIA PART .
THEY ALL used to go up there and RELATIVES THAT USED TO WORK AT BELK 'S AT THAT TIME IN THE CAFETERIA PART would have THEY ALL saying do n't go in THE SAME OLD DIRTY BATHROOM .
As soon as THEY ALL got a chance THEY ALL would go in THE SAME OLD DIRTY BATHROOM .
THE GREYHOUND BUS STATION USED TO HAVE THE SAME THING
THEY ALL used to go in there and play around and go in THE SAME OLD DIRTY BATHROOM just to be seeing what was in there .
THE SAME OLD DIRTY BATHROOM was THE SAME OLD DIRTY BATHROOM .
THE SAME OLD DIRTY BATHROOM was no big different .
THEY ALL could never figure out why THE SAME OLD DIRTY BATHROOM was such a big issue to have separate bathrooms .
What 's the problem ? THEY ALL used in THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT .
What can OK MRS. ENGLISH say ? OK MRS. ENGLISH remember THE BUSSES .
OK MRS. ENGLISH never got on A BUS because OK MRS. ENGLISH parents would n't let OK MRS. ENGLISH ride A BUS .
THEY ALL walked and THEY ALL had a car .

THE LATE '60S , EARLY '70S was mostly gone .
Mostly gone .

WE could walk to THE WHITE HOUSE , to THE BIG ZOO , ALL OF IT ON COLUMBIA CIRCLE , THE BIG ZOO , ALL OF IT ON COLUMBIA CIRCLE , right near THE WHITE HOUSE .
In fact , WE could stand out on ONLY ONE STREET and look down on THE WHITE HOUSE .
THE WHITE HOUSE was real pretty .
THE WHITE HOUSE just was n't safe .
THE WHITE HOUSE was n't safe at all .
Even though the violence scared YOUR were YOUR sympathetic with why THE FOLKS were rioting ? Did YOUR understand why THE FOLKS were frustrated ?
Yes , OK MRS. ENGLISH did understand that part because MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY was MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY to have a change .
THE FOLKS should n't have to work in somebody 's house .
AN OLD PERSON should n't have to get the lowest education because AN OLD PERSON are black .
THE FOLKS should have equal rights .
THE FOLKS were born .
THE FOLKS all got blood .
THE FOLKS all think alike .
THE FOLKS all got BRAINS .
THE FOLKS 's what OK MRS. ENGLISH could say .
THE FOLKS all got BRAINS but why is ONE SMARTER than THE OTHER .
OK MRS. ENGLISH could never figure ONE SMARTER out .
OK MRS. ENGLISH worked real hard in THE HIGH SCHOOL purpose and became AN A STUDENT .
OK MRS. ENGLISH friends over HERE , MY FRIENDS OVER HERE were all white .
OK MRS. ENGLISH was the only black .
MY FRIENDS OVER HERE would have to sit with OK MRS. ENGLISH because OK MRS. ENGLISH was AN A STUDENT .
MY FRIENDS OVER HERE would sit US in THE FRONT OF THE CLASS LIKE SHOW US OFF or whatever .
MY FRIENDS OVER HERE did n't want to show OK MRS. ENGLISH off because OK MRS. ENGLISH was black .
YOUR felt like MY FRIENDS OVER HERE resented YOUR presence ?
MY FRIENDS OVER HERE resented YOUR PRESENCE but there was nothing MY FRIENDS OVER HERE could do because OK MRS. ENGLISH was AN A STUDENT .
YOUR PRESENCE was like why is AN A STUDENT here .
AN A STUDENT 's AN A STUDENT .
OK MRS. ENGLISH did have SOME REAL NICE TEACHERS THAT BELIEVED IN SOME OF THE THINGS WE BELIEVED IN .
WE should be treated equally .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think THE BEST THAT COULD 'VE HAPPENED TO ME IN SCHOOL was THE BEST THAT COULD 'VE HAPPENED TO ME IN SCHOOL .

YOUR felt like THE VIOLENCE IN DC was partly THE VIOLENCE IN DC much like YOUR had experienced YOUR ?
It was worse that what OK MRS. ENGLISH had experienced as a child .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had never experienced THE VIOLENCE IN DC .
WE were so far out in WOODS THE VIOLENCE IN DC was not like WE had OUR NEIGHBORS .
WE neighbors were TWENTY-FIVE MILES away .
THE ONLY TIME WE REALLY SAW ANYBODY was when WE went into town .
THE ONLY TIME WE REALLY SAW ANYBODY was to sell THE VEGETABLES and WE very seldom got to go into town unless THE ONLY TIME WE REALLY SAW ANYBODY was like a special occasion .
WE never got to leave THE FARM .
Everything WE had been on THE FARM .
WE loved WOODS .
WE did fishing .
WE did THE FARM all .
HORSEBACK RIDING , sticks .
It was n't REAL HORSES .
WE had sticks that WE rode REAL HORSES on .
WE had a horse but HORSEBACK RIDING was for OK MRS. ENGLISH brother to deliver newspapers with .
WE used to ride the hogs and the cows and THE STUFF .
THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS are the things WE called REAL HORSES at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY was fun .
MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY was MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
OK MRS. ENGLISH really missed MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY when OK MRS. ENGLISH moved to THE CITY , ALL THIS , THE OUTSIDE , the quietness , just the space and the air is different .
It was a big difference when we moved to THE CITY , ALL THIS .
Up until the early '90s YOUR had never lived in THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE , right ? Is that true ?
OK MRS. ENGLISH used to come over here when OK MRS. ENGLISH used to go out .
But , no , OK MRS. ENGLISH never lived in THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE .
When YOUR were a young kid in YOUR DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE do YOUR have any memories of THIS AREA BELMONT ?
Yeah , YOUR DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE was rough .
YOUR DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE was real bad .
OK MRS. ENGLISH and OK MRS. ENGLISH girlfriend used to go out and WE used to come through HERE .
AN OLD PERSON could hear the gun fire and YOUR PEOPLE .
Oh god , WE would always have to run .
Now , WE hung out in VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT .
WE hung out in VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT was just as bad but VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT just seemed like VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT was worse .
THIS used to be called NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE .
THIS 's still NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know why THEY call us THIS AREA BELMONT .
THIS AREA BELMONT was NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE then and THIS AREA BELMONT 's still NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE .
Now AN OLD PERSON have OLD NORTH CHARLOTTE WHICH IS STILL NORTH CHARLOTTE .
THEY broke OLD NORTH CHARLOTTE WHICH IS STILL NORTH CHARLOTTE down into these specific neighborhoods after AN OLD PERSON got YOUR PEOPLE with MONEY AND YOUR DEVELOPERS and THE CITY , ALL THIS .
OLD NORTH CHARLOTTE WHICH IS STILL NORTH CHARLOTTE 's still NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE .
So YOUR and YOUR friends did n't really call THIS AREA BELMONT ?
THIS AREA BELMONT was n't THIS AREA BELMONT .
THIS AREA BELMONT was called NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE .
Nobody ever knew .
OK MRS. ENGLISH sisters lived in VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT for these some odd years and SHE never knew of anything called VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT .
SHE knew of THE SCHOOL VILLA HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT NOBODY TOLD HER HER NEIGHBORHOOD WAS VILLA HEIGHTS .
THE SCHOOL VILLA HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT NOBODY TOLD HER HER NEIGHBORHOOD WAS VILLA HEIGHTS was like MY SISTERS AND BROTHERS saying VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like , `` Where are these places located ? '' We never heard .
THE SCHOOL VILLA HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT NOBODY TOLD HER HER NEIGHBORHOOD WAS VILLA HEIGHTS was all NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE .
THE SCHOOL VILLA HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT NOBODY TOLD HER HER NEIGHBORHOOD WAS VILLA HEIGHTS was n't VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT .
THE SCHOOL VILLA HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT NOBODY TOLD HER HER NEIGHBORHOOD WAS VILLA HEIGHTS was just NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE .
THE SCHOOL VILLA HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT NOBODY TOLD HER HER NEIGHBORHOOD WAS VILLA HEIGHTS 's interesting .
THE SCHOOL VILLA HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT NOBODY TOLD HER HER NEIGHBORHOOD WAS VILLA HEIGHTS sounds like NO NAMES ON THEM were attached to THAT PLACE later .
THEY may have been THERE BUT NOBODY distinguished THEY .
We just called THERE BUT NOBODY NORTH CAROLINA IN THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE , NO NAMES ON THEM .
YOUR say THIS AREA BELMONT was violent by the mid to THE LATE '60S , EARLY '70S .
Was THIS AREA BELMONT predominantly AFRICAN-AMERICAN or - ?
THIS AREA BELMONT was white .
THIS AREA BELMONT was still white .
It was all white up until-I think THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE said THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE moved here in THE '60S , LATE '60S SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE said THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE was THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE .
MS. CELESTE was the SECOND one OK MRS. ENGLISH believe .

HERE sits on HERE porch A LOT .
HER PORCH A LOT was right in this block , HER PORCH A LOT sounds like , were the OUR FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN homes in THIS AREA BELMONT .
Yeah , there were .
Have YOUR heard any of YOUR neighbors tell stories about what HER PORCH A LOT was like when OUR NEIGHBORS OUR FIRST moved here ?
MS. CELESTE , MS. CELESTE said HER PORCH A LOT was all white .
OUR NEIGHBORS had NO ISSUES BECAUSE EVERYBODY STAYED TO THEMSELVES , NO ISSUES BECAUSE EVERYBODY STAYED TO THEMSELVES .
MS. CELESTE only had ONE CHILD .
ONE CHILD did n't live here at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLAH was A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLAH or THE KIDS or a bunch of commotion , none of THE KIDS .
ONE CHILD said A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLAH was nice .
A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLAH was called SUNNYSIDE I BELIEVE .
KENNON STREET , 1401 KENNON STREET used to be called SUNNYSIDE I BELIEVE .
SUNNYSIDE I BELIEVE 's what SUNNYSIDE I BELIEVE says on OK MRS. ENGLISH deed .
SUNNYSIDE I BELIEVE 's called SUNNYSIDE I BELIEVE .
What made YOUR decide to move to THIS AREA BELMONT in ' 93 ? SARAH THUESEN should back up and say where were THIS AREA BELMONT ?
OK MRS. ENGLISH lived over in HONDURAS OFF OF SUGAR CREEK .
HONDURAS APARTMENTS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH was living over there .
OK MRS. ENGLISH knew THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE here because OK MRS. ENGLISH daughter had a son by HER SON .
HER SON used to get in a lot of trouble .
ONE PARTICULAR NIGHT THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE called , THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE called and THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE had a lot of homes in THAT AREA .
THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE had bought up-her father had purchased , OK MRS. ENGLISH think THEY had SEVERAL HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
During the time that THE CITY , ALL THIS came through and THEY coded THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE homes really bad .
THEY took A FEW OF THEM I BELIEVE .
A FEW OF THEM I BELIEVE only had TWO O'CLOCK left when OK MRS. ENGLISH came into the picture in 1993 .
THE ONE WHO YOU THINK was THE ONE WHO YOU THINK and A FEW OF THEM I BELIEVE had another one up on Parson Street .
At MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY , A FEW OF THEM I BELIEVE had to either fix MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY or THE CITY , ALL THIS was going to demolish THE CITY , ALL THIS , THIS PARTICULAR HOME and THE ONE WHO YOU THINK up on Parson .
THIS PARTICULAR HOME was paid for .
THIS PARTICULAR HOME was vacant .
THE DRUG DEALERS used to hang out here .
Then SHE had this lady that was homeless that had asked SHE to live here because SHE did n't have anywhere to stay .
SHE told the lady SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE had n't been remodeled .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was n't safe for a family .
THIS PARTICULAR LADY had THE KIDS .
THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE agreed to pay THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE 250 a month just to live here temporarily .
THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE let THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE move in but THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE never paid THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE HER 250 A MONTH JUST TO LIVE HERE TEMPORARILY .
THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE paid THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE whenever THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE could .
HER 250 A MONTH JUST TO LIVE HERE TEMPORARILY went on for THESE YEARS WHEN , OK MRS. ENGLISH think .
Then in '93 is when THE CITY , ALL THIS came out and started coding , THE CODE ENFORCEMENT .
THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY coded THE CITY , ALL THIS , THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY had to move .
THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY did n't want to move .
THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY went down and filed papers against Blanch Perry as a bad landlord or whatever .
THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY took THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY to court .
Then THE CITY , ALL THIS , well AN OLD PERSON got NINETY DAYS to either fix AN OLD PERSON house or we 're going to demolish THE CITY , ALL THIS .
During THIS MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY is when THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY had a bad illness .
THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY was real bad off sick .
OK MRS. ENGLISH told THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY if OK MRS. ENGLISH could help THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY let OK MRS. ENGLISH know .
THE LADY THAT WAS STAYING HERE TEMPORARILY , AFTER THE CITY called and said , `` Can AN OLD PERSON help OK MRS. ENGLISH ? THIS are going to take OK MRS. ENGLISH house . ''
THIS 's when OK MRS. ENGLISH really became deeply involved with this particular neighborhood because OK MRS. ENGLISH found - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH really went through THE PHONE BOOKS and CALLED PEOPLE that OK MRS. ENGLISH knew to ask CALLED PEOPLE questions about what could be done to save SOME LADY 'S HOUSE .
CALLED PEOPLE told OK MRS. ENGLISH get AN OLD PERSON code enforcement sheets .
Tell CALLED PEOPLE to get AN OLD PERSON A COPY OF ALL OF YOUR CODE VIOLATIONS .
CALLED PEOPLE 's when OK MRS. ENGLISH went , OK MRS. ENGLISH and OK MRS. ENGLISH girlfriends , then WE got an attorney .
OK MRS. ENGLISH ca n't remember .
A COPY OF ALL OF YOUR CODE VIOLATIONS was A LEGAL AID PERSON .
WE did n't go to see A LEGAL AID PERSON .
WE just spoke to A LEGAL AID PERSON by phone .
THEY said well AN OLD PERSON can look at AN OLD PERSON paper work .
AN OLD PERSON can actually tell whether or not YOUR PAPER WORK 's YOUR PAPER WORK .
A LEGAL AID PERSON said , `` Do AN OLD PERSON see anything like a dirty wall or a dirty floor ? '' OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like yeah .
THEY got dirty wall .
THEY got dirty floor .
THEY got dirty THIS .
He said , `` Well , all AN OLD PERSON do is go in there and either wash THIS or either paint THIS .
THIS will take THIS out of code . ''
OK MRS. ENGLISH learned A LOT from OK MRS. ENGLISH friends and AN ATTORNEY FRIEND that WE were talking to by phone .
WE did n't have money to pay AN ATTORNEY FRIEND for A NEIGHBORHOOD YOUTH SERVICES .
Was that MR. FILLETTE 'S by any chance ?
Yeah .
MR. FILLETTE 'S been around for A WHILE .
WE got the list .
WE had to go out - .
WE had to get a mortgage on SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE because WE did n't have enough funds to fix SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER , THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER would not move .
THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER stayed here .
THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER took THE FIRST BLACK COUPLE to court , back and forth to court .
THE JUDGE kept telling THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER NO , NO .
THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER do n't have to move .
Then THAT 's when THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER decided well , maybe if - .
AN OLD PERSON know , THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER could n't handle THAT anymore .
THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER said well let OK MRS. ENGLISH just give AN OLD PERSON SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE , then see what AN OLD PERSON can do with SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE to save SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE 's when OK MRS. ENGLISH told THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER , `` Fine with OK MRS. ENGLISH . ''
OK MRS. ENGLISH have no problem with putting this broad out .
OK MRS. ENGLISH used to send the Sheriff over in the middle of the night to have THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER all , THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER put out in THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT .
Then we 'd go to court and THE JUDGE would just be going on and on , `` Make THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER AN OLD PERSON tenant . ''
`` No , OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't want THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER as A TENANT .
OK MRS. ENGLISH want THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY THAT WAS LIVING HER out of SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE so OK MRS. ENGLISH can fix SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE so OK MRS. ENGLISH can live there . ''
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE took THAT PARTICULAR YEAR to get that woman out of SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE through THE LEGAL PROCESS .
THE LEGAL PROCESS is bad for HOMEOWNERS .
THE PEOPLE THAT OWN YOUR PROPERTY , A TENANT can make YOUR PROPERTY rough for AN OLD PERSON .
THE PEOPLE THAT OWN YOUR PROPERTY can actually take AN OLD PERSON property away from AN OLD PERSON by the laws .
THE JUDGE wo n't put THE PEOPLE THAT OWN YOUR PROPERTY out , `` Oh , let THE PEOPLE THAT OWN YOUR PROPERTY stay there and let THE PEOPLE THAT OWN YOUR PROPERTY pay AN OLD PERSON $ 175 A WEEK . ''
If AN OLD PERSON ca n't pay HER 250 A MONTH JUST TO LIVE HERE TEMPORARILY A MONTH how THE JUDGE Come on , A WEEK 's enough .
OK MRS. ENGLISH said , `` Naw . ''
THE JUDGE really got frustrated with OK MRS. ENGLISH each time we went to court .
THE JUDGE would tell OK MRS. ENGLISH let THEM live .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would say , `` No , THEM ca n't live here . ''
Finally , in the end-I think about SEVEN or EIGHT months-the city stepped in because THE CODE ENFORCEMENT .
THEM were coming in and out and coding everything .
THE CITY , ALL THIS actually relocated MS. CELESTE .
MS. CELESTE was an old crack head , drug sellers , everything .
THE KIDS used to sell drugs and stuff .
THE CITY , ALL THIS went on like that for six months .
After OK MRS. ENGLISH got MS. CELESTE out , SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was basically SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was demolished in THE INSIDE .
NO WATER was NO WATER .
The ceiling was rotted out .
There was no heat system in SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
There was NO WATER , NO WATER .
NO WATER was roaches swimming in the kitchen sink , stuck on THE WALLS with rats EVERYWHERE .
NO WATER was terrible .
NO WATER was horrible .
Then NO WATER was just like why would THE PEOPLE THAT OWN YOUR PROPERTY stay in such filth and then OK MRS. ENGLISH looked and OK MRS. ENGLISH could understand why .
THIS was all THIS knew .
THIS was all THIS knew about .
It was pitiful because THIS had A YOUNGER DAUGHTER and A YOUNGER SON at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY and a boyfriend that A YOUNGER DAUGHTER beat , and A YOUNGER SON beat A YOUNGER DAUGHTER .
MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY was just awful for THE KIDS .
Sounds like AN AWFUL SITUATION .
Yeah , AN AWFUL SITUATION was .
It was better when SHE got out .
Then SHE went to - .
SHE moved from HERE to Dundeen which was ever worse .
DUNDEEN OVER THERE OFF OF BEATTIES FORD ROAD .
Is that A NEIGHBORHOOD ?
THAT 's THAT .
DUNDEEN OVER THERE OFF OF BEATTIES FORD ROAD . just - .
THIS PARTICULAR LADY is just ghetto , is what OK MRS. ENGLISH call THEM .
THIS PARTICULAR LADY 's just bang , bang , shoot THEM up , fight , fight , drink , drink .
THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS are the kind of people OK MRS. ENGLISH call ghetto .
THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS do n't know any other life other than JUST GHETTOISM is what OK MRS. ENGLISH call JUST GHETTOISM .
THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS do n't know how to survive with a-doing other things outside of beating and cursing and ranting and raving .
THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS do n't know any other way .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't if JUST GHETTOISM 's how THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS was brought up or if THIS is just what AN OLD PERSON do when AN OLD PERSON live in a neighborhood like THIS .
GOD THAT 'S AN OLD TREE , JUST GHETTOISM was awful .
When OK MRS. ENGLISH got SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was terrible .
Did YOUR have moments where YOUR SECOND guessed YOUR decision to take SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE ?
OK MRS. ENGLISH still have moments that OK MRS. ENGLISH feel like OK MRS. ENGLISH could have had this if OK MRS. ENGLISH had n't of been here .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 've put all OK MRS. ENGLISH life savings , every dime of OK MRS. ENGLISH money , every dime that OK MRS. ENGLISH 've had saved or would have had into SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
When MS. CELESTE moved out THE ROOF WE , OK MRS. ENGLISH had to have a new roof .
THE ROOF WE was five roofs up on top of SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
THE CITY , ALL THIS made OK MRS. ENGLISH take all that down .
THE WALLS had to be - .
THE WALLS had THE HOLES .
Of course AN OLD PERSON had to fix THE WALLS .
Then THEM made - .
Then what topped it off , what really got OK MRS. ENGLISH , THE BACK DOOR sits - .
THEM made OK MRS. ENGLISH move THE BACK DOOR from ONE CORNER OF MY HOUSE TO THE OTHER CORNER OF MY HOUSE .
Why was that ?
THEM never said .
THEM just said THE BACK DOOR was in the wrong place .
THEM made OK MRS. ENGLISH move THE WHOLE BACK DOOR .
Then THEM means THE WOOD THAT-IT 'S A WOOD HOUSE .
THE WOOD THAT-IT 'S A WOOD HOUSE 's made out of THE WOOD .
All of the houses in HERE is made out of wood .
In fact , when THE WOOD was taken off THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN could n't put THE WOOD THAT-IT 'S A WOOD HOUSE back together .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had to go out and buy new wood to fix THE WALL TO LOOK LIKE THE OTHER WALL .
How much of all this work did YOUR do YOUR ?
OK MRS. ENGLISH ended up doing THE MAJORITY OF IT .
OK MRS. ENGLISH and OK MRS. ENGLISH sisters and kids ended up doing THE MAJORITY OF IT , what WE could in THE INSIDE .
Now , THE ROOF WE did n't touch .
WE had somebody that made A MESS , but anyway .
WE had that person .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had to get a plumber .
During the time that MS. CELESTE got out of SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE , SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was vacant .
The floors in HERE were like down hill , uphill .
THEY had like run down , rotted out .
THEY were just - .
AN OLD PERSON would walk in HERE and IT was like walking downhill .
AN OLD PERSON walk over HERE IT 's like walking uphill , all the way through SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
All the floors had to be leveled .
IT was like THE GUY THAT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME .
THE GUY THAT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME tore out - .
THE GUY THAT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME was doing YOUR PAPER WORK and we gave THE GUY THAT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME money .
In fact , THE GUY THAT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME got about $ 26,000 .
Basically THE GUY THAT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME did n't do anything .
THE GUY THAT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME would tell OK MRS. ENGLISH that code person say , `` Yes YOUR PAPER WORK passed . ''
Then OK MRS. ENGLISH would see another code person and they said , `` No , OK MRS. ENGLISH did n't say this . ''
By THE LATE '60S , EARLY '70S , all the monies was gone .
THE GUY THAT WAS THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME got fired from THE CITY , ALL THIS .
THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME was THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME .
THE CONTRACTOR WHICH WAS A CITY , WORKING FOR THE CITY AT THAT TIME got fired .
THE CITY , ALL THIS still left OK MRS. ENGLISH holding the gun with work to be done .
OK MRS. ENGLISH just got in HERE , OK MRS. ENGLISH and A SISTER .
During MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY OK MRS. ENGLISH was at CHARLOTTE AREA TRANSIT SYSTEM -RSB- .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would come home from YOUR PAPER WORK on SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE , go back to MY OTHER HOUSE that OK MRS. ENGLISH was living in .
This was vacant and OK MRS. ENGLISH lived over on HONDURAS OFF OF SUGAR CREEK .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would come over here on NINETY DAYS off and work all day to THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT until finally NINETY DAYS was just SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
NINETY DAYS did n't have any - .
THE HEAT was good because OK MRS. ENGLISH had to have a heating system put in which was too small .
THE HEAT 's sitting out on OK MRS. ENGLISH front porch , on HER SIDE OF THE STREET OVER THERE , AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SHE JUST SWEEPING . .
OK MRS. ENGLISH paid $ 2500 for a unit that was too small .
THE CODE ENFORCEMENT said THE CODE ENFORCEMENT was too small .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had to end up going back to get another unit .
THE LATE '60S , EARLY '70S THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN said let 'S just get central air while AN OLD PERSON at 'S .
OK MRS. ENGLISH said A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE .
A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE 's how OK MRS. ENGLISH ended up with central air .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would n't have had central air either .
A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE 's just been one thing after another .
OK MRS. ENGLISH fix THIS , something else breaks down .
THIS 's just like SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE is so old .
THIS 's settling .
Every time THIS settles THIS 's something going wrong , always something to fix .
Then when OK MRS. ENGLISH was remodeling THIS THE OLD DRUNKS or the drinkers in THIS AREA BELMONT , THE OLD DRUNKS came over and THE OLD DRUNKS stole all of the copper piping .
OK MRS. ENGLISH did n't know that THE OLD DRUNKS had taken THE PIPING .
Then THE PIPING had aluminum siding on the outside of SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE , THE OLD DRUNKS stripped all of the siding off the house one night .
OK MRS. ENGLISH came back and THE PIPING was just like who put THE HOLES in SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
There was just THE HOLES everywhere because THE WOOD was decayed .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like who did this .
Nobody knew anything but all of the siding was gone .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had to go out and get somebody to put siding on SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE must 've been incredibly frustrating .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was .
The more OK MRS. ENGLISH did , the more they stole while OK MRS. ENGLISH was in THE LEGAL PROCESS .
THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME , THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME were stealing OK MRS. ENGLISH tools at O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT .
THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME would come over and steal THE STUFF from US at O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT , THE WOOD , THE SAWS , THE STUFF .
US 'd buy .
THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME 'd steal THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME when US 'd leave and stuff .
THE STUFF was awful .
THE STUFF was terrible .
Was there a good bit of violence in THIS AREA BELMONT at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY ?
THEY were shooting .
It was nothing to see A BUNCH OF DRUG DEALERS STANDING AROUND SELLING DRUGS ALL DAY .
During the times that OK MRS. ENGLISH would be over here working A BUNCH OF DRUG DEALERS STANDING AROUND SELLING DRUGS ALL DAY was awful .
THEY would just be standing .
This used to be , this house used to be A HOT SPOT .
In fact , THE POLICE raided OK MRS. ENGLISH house .
Really ?
In 1998 .
THEY tried to knock THE BACK DOOR down but OK MRS. ENGLISH have three-ply steel .
WE had to open THE BACK DOOR .
THEY still - .
WE opened THE BACK DOOR but THEY raided OK MRS. ENGLISH house .
Because the drug dealers that live in THAT AREA happened to be one of my daughter 's friends .
OK MRS. ENGLISH daughters know all of them because MY TWO DAUGHTERS all went to school .
THIS PARTICULAR GUY comes to SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
THIS PARTICULAR GUY sits around .
In fact , THIS PARTICULAR GUY has a baby by OK MRS. ENGLISH daughter .
THIS PARTICULAR GUY used to come by .
THE POLICE was after THE POLICE back and forth .
THE DRUG DEALERS used to live here , basically , before OK MRS. ENGLISH moved into SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH was in THE DRUG DEALERS territory .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would be in SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE after OK MRS. ENGLISH moved in HERE .
THE DRUG DEALERS would be outside SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH did n't have to worry about nobody breaking in .
THE DRUG DEALERS did n't destroy - .
THE DRUG DEALERS would destroy AN OLD PERSON property by trashing YOUR PROPERTY , but THE DRUG DEALERS would n't steal and THE DRUG DEALERS did n't break in .
Basically , THE DRUG DEALERS were A GOOD SOURCE FOR ME at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY because A GOOD SOURCE FOR ME was A GOOD SOURCE FOR ME .
What do YOUR mean THE DRUG DEALERS were A GOOD SOURCE FOR ME ?
THE DRUG DEALERS were , as far as making THE TRANSITION from where OK MRS. ENGLISH lived , peace and quiet , NO NOISE AT ALL , to an area where everybody walked the streets all night .
It was nothing to hear gunfire .
OK MRS. ENGLISH could open this front door and THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME would be shooting at each other right here .
OK MRS. ENGLISH could hear THE GUN PELLETS HITTING MY FENCE hitting MY FENCE out HERE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH could hear THE GUN PELLETS HITTING MY FENCE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH could n't stand in HERE , lay in HERE really , and these windows would be lit up with blue fire where THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME would just be shooting right outside .
OK MRS. ENGLISH did n't have MY FENCE that OK MRS. ENGLISH have now .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had to remodel because THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME walked that down .
MY FENCE was just flat .
THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME were running up in the yard behind OK MRS. ENGLISH - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had A TREE here and THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME would be shooting from behind A TREE .
A TREE would be caught in OK MRS. ENGLISH cars that would be parked out here .
THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME would be dodging behind THE CAR SHOOTING AT EACH OTHER .
THE CAR SHOOTING AT EACH OTHER was nothing .
THE POLICE , when THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME showed up THE CAR SHOOTING AT EACH OTHER was all over .
THIS went on not only in this-and THIS was one of your worst streets .
KENNON STREET , 1401 KENNON STREET was off the chain .
How effective was the police in trying to rein in some of THE VIOLENCE ?
At OUR FIRST , OK MRS. ENGLISH did n't have no faith in THE POLICE DEPARTMENT .
First of all when OK MRS. ENGLISH did decided to move here , which OK MRS. ENGLISH had to come in by OK MRS. ENGLISH because OK MRS. ENGLISH daughters would n't come with OK MRS. ENGLISH .
MY TWO DAUGHTERS said MY TWO DAUGHTERS were too afraid to stay here .
Basically , OK MRS. ENGLISH was living here by OK MRS. ENGLISH .
At MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY OK MRS. ENGLISH did n't have any faith in THE POLICE DEPARTMENT or anybody really because to ride through THIS AREA BELMONT and see THE broke down THE HOUSES , the people walking ONLY ONE STREET , THE DRUG DEALERS just standing out broad open daylight , shooting at each other , broad open daylight , stabbings , hair fight , AN OLD PERSON know fighting .
FIVE MINUTES FROM YOUR DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE AND FIVE MINUTES is basically FIVE MINUTES FROM YOUR DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE AND FIVE MINUTES away from THE POLICE DEPARTMENT .
OK MRS. ENGLISH could not believe .
How is FIVE MINUTES FROM YOUR DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE AND FIVE MINUTES possible that THIS AREA BELMONT got like THIS WITH YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENT within FIVE MINUTES FROM YOUR DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE AND FIVE MINUTES ? OK MRS. ENGLISH 've always felt like it was A PURPOSE FOR THEM TO LET THIS NEIGHBORHOOD GO DOWN LIKE THIS FOR THE SIMPLE REASON , THE SAME THING THAT THEY ARE DOING NOW-REVITALIZATION AND TAKE OVER .
FIVE MINUTES FROM YOUR DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE AND FIVE MINUTES 's all OK MRS. ENGLISH could ever see .
Every police officer here has to go through HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET to get to the office downtown , right .
AN OLD PERSON telling OK MRS. ENGLISH all this is going on and HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET did n't know .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't think HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET like me very well either .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET 's one reason why HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET raided OK MRS. ENGLISH house .
OK MRS. ENGLISH used to be THE INSIDE and THE DRUG DEALERS , THE DRUG DEALERS were THE DRUG DEALERS .
THE DRUG DEALERS would come here and THE DRUG DEALERS would say , `` OK MRS. ENGLISH , OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm hungry . ''
DUH .
A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLAH do AN OLD PERSON want OK MRS. ENGLISH to do ? `` If OK MRS. ENGLISH go buy SOME FOOD will AN OLD PERSON cook SOME FOOD for OK MRS. ENGLISH ? '' Sure .
LOVE TO .
LOVE TO . 's going to cost AN OLD PERSON .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would charge THEM like twenty dollars just to cook THEM MY GAS MONEY .
THEM 'd say , `` Well we 'll give MY GAS MONEY to AN OLD PERSON . ''
Oh , okay then .
MY GAS MONEY 's MY GAS MONEY .
Okay .
During THE LATE '60S , EARLY '70S OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm calling THE POLICE 24/7 A DAY .
Finally THEY would say , `` Well OK MRS. ENGLISH think AN OLD PERSON in with THE LATE '60S , EARLY '70S because THEY still there .
THEY 's AN OLD PERSON property .
AN OLD PERSON 've got to get THEY off AN OLD PERSON property . ''
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like , `` WELL if AN OLD PERSON ca n't do `` WELL , what makes AN OLD PERSON think OK MRS. ENGLISH can do `` WELL ? '' `` WELL got so bad to where as THEY would come out here and THEY would jump THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME .
THEY would brutal - .
`` WELL would be something brutal where THEY would slam THEY heads on the sidewalk and bust THEY face and smash `` WELL in the rocks .
`` WELL got awful .
YOUR saw THESE POLICE ?
Yeah .
Then OK MRS. ENGLISH started taping THESE POLICE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH started taping THESE POLICE with THE CAMCORDER .
THESE POLICE really got THESE POLICE mad .
OK MRS. ENGLISH started making complaints into the police department-What is THE CAMCORDER called ? - internal affairs .
Then THE CAMCORDER really got nasty at THE CAMCORDER MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
OK MRS. ENGLISH was real vicious at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
Then OK MRS. ENGLISH would be in HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET because OK MRS. ENGLISH would let OK MRS. ENGLISH daughter drive OK MRS. ENGLISH car and HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET would drop OK MRS. ENGLISH off early .
OK MRS. ENGLISH always got off at ONE or TWO O'CLOCK in THE AFTERNOON .
Nobody would ever be out here in midday because ONE would be real , real hot in THE SUMMER .
HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET would always come in THE AFTERNOON .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would always be inside SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE already .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was like nothing moving except for OK MRS. ENGLISH and the TV at a hush because OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm scared to death .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 've got to listen for the gunfire .
ME AND THE TV AT A HUSH would be out here .
Then all of sudden THESE POLICE officers would show up .
THESE POLICE would be walking around messing with THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME , harassing THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME .
THESE POLICE would be sitting actually up in OK MRS. ENGLISH back yard up against OK MRS. ENGLISH house or all the way around SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE , wherever .
Then one particular incident OK MRS. ENGLISH found that THE OFFICERS were actually sticking DRUGS ALL DAY into THE GUYS THAT WAS HELPING ME possessions .
Did YOUR see THIS happen ?
Yeah , OK MRS. ENGLISH saw that happen .
Then THIS 's when OK MRS. ENGLISH really had to speak out .
AN OLD PERSON ca n't do THIS .
If AN OLD PERSON 're going to get THEM AN OLD PERSON have to do THIS legally .
OK MRS. ENGLISH felt like A LOT OF STUFF THEY WERE DOING was not doing A LOT OF STUFF THEY WERE DOING right .
NO , NO , OK MRS. ENGLISH ca n't help AN OLD PERSON if AN OLD PERSON not going to do A LOT OF STUFF THEY WERE DOING right .
OK MRS. ENGLISH guess THE OFFICERS was frustrated because there were so many of THE OFFICERS .
To OK MRS. ENGLISH , OK MRS. ENGLISH was a newcomer and OK MRS. ENGLISH was just looking in .
OK MRS. ENGLISH could n't see A LOT OF STUFF THEY WERE DOING .
AN OLD PERSON had REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE get robbed in OK MRS. ENGLISH back yard , stripped naked .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE get robbed in OK MRS. ENGLISH back yard .
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT would get here but REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE would be later .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE would always show up much later than what REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE need to .
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT made OK MRS. ENGLISH feel like something is not right .
Then all of sudden nobody showing up at any time .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had A GUY THAT SHOT THROUGH MY CAR OUT THERE ONE DAY , SHOOTING AT SOMEBODY ELSE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH called and nobody showed up until like SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT .
THEY said it was JUST A .
THEY did n't get THE BEST THING .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like yeah right .
AN OLD PERSON were hoping that OK MRS. ENGLISH had been behind that shot , right ? OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know .
PRETTY GOOD OFFICERS are PRETTY GOOD OFFICERS , but OK MRS. ENGLISH still say THIS AREA BELMONT should have never gotten-no neighborhood deserves to be like THE ONE WHO YOU THINK and VILLA HEIGHTS , BELMONT and OPTIMIST PARK .
THIS AREA BELMONT , not especially with a large police force like WE have here .
No neighborhood this close to AN OLD PERSON downtown area should have ever gotten this bad .
THE CITY , ALL THIS should have stepped in .
The homes that are dilapidated or whatever , THE CITY , ALL THIS should 've done something years ago .
What 's A PURPOSE FOR THEM TO LET THIS NEIGHBORHOOD GO DOWN LIKE THIS FOR THE SIMPLE REASON , THE SAME THING THAT THEY ARE DOING NOW-REVITALIZATION AND TAKE OVER ? All of sudden THEY got all these relocation CERTAIN PROGRAMS .
THEY got this .
THEY got that .
THE SAME THING THEY HAD YEARS AGO , RIGHT ? Probably had more because THE SAME THING THEY HAD YEARS AGO , RIGHT ? was cheaper then .
Now all of sudden , THE CITY , ALL THIS and THIS HOPE VI THING .
Everybody 'S up on Hope VI la la la .
RIGHT ? AI n't nothing but a total rip off as far as OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm concerned .
RIGHT ? AI 's just RIGHT ? AI .
YOUR 're describing a lot of really frustrating things YOUR experienced when YOUR OUR FIRST moved here and scary things .
Was there something that YOUR liked about THIS AREA BELMONT that convinced YOUR , YOUR wanted to stay here despite all the problems ?
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE
THE FIRST HOUSE was THE FIRST HOUSE that OK MRS. ENGLISH have ever owned with HER LAST NAME .
OK MRS. ENGLISH never owned A HOME .
OK MRS. ENGLISH lived in HONDURAS APARTMENTS . .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had A HOME but A HOME was out in PINE VALLEY , way out .
At MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY AN OLD PERSON did n't have bus transportation there .
After OK MRS. ENGLISH lost OK MRS. ENGLISH car OK MRS. ENGLISH had to move .
OK MRS. ENGLISH lived in EARLE VILLAGE twice in A LIFETIME .
Was that when YOUR were pretty young ?
OK MRS. ENGLISH was twenty-three , twenty-four .
OK MRS. ENGLISH moved into EARLE VILLAGE from GRIER HEIGHTS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH stayed there for A YEAR .
Then OK MRS. ENGLISH got A JOB .
A JOB 's when OK MRS. ENGLISH was working at DUKE POWER AT THE CATAWBA NUCLEAR PLANT IN CONSTRUCTION .
Then THE RENT went sky high over there .
They gave me-a program name Upward Bound gave OK MRS. ENGLISH the house out in PINE VALLEY .
OK MRS. ENGLISH stayed out there for three or four years .
Then OK MRS. ENGLISH car was n't any good to get back and forth .
OK MRS. ENGLISH was at ORTHOPEDIC HOSPITAL at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had to give that up .
OK MRS. ENGLISH moved back to EARLE VILLAGE .
What was EARLE VILLAGE like at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY ?
EARLE VILLAGE was basically one of your-I thought it was THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH could n't see nothing but EARLE VILLAGE every time OK MRS. ENGLISH opened THE BACK DOOR .
They say THE PIEDMONT COURTS was THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
It was the oldest .
THE PIEDMONT COURTS was basically like OK MRS. ENGLISH neighborhood now .
We had a lot people , THE KIDS everywhere .
AN OLD PERSON never heard a lot of gunfire but AN OLD PERSON had a lot of fights .
AN OLD PERSON know , OUR NEIGHBORS fighting OUR NEIGHBORS .
Children fighting THE YOUNGER CHILDREN , simply because nobody worked .
Everybody was on welfare .
Everybody sat at home all day .
As far as some of YOUR SAME THINGS that OK MRS. ENGLISH have endured since OK MRS. ENGLISH have been here-living in EARLE VILLAGE was A PIECE OF CAKE .
Really .
Based on from A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLAH OK MRS. ENGLISH 've had to live through HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET since OK MRS. ENGLISH 've been in SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
YOUR felt safer at EARLE VILLAGE than YOUR do here ?
Yes , much safer in EARLE VILLAGE .
Even with EARLE VILLAGE being THE PROJECTS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH felt more comfortable .
OK MRS. ENGLISH felt like it was safer than EARLE VILLAGE was when OK MRS. ENGLISH OUR FIRST moved here .
THIS was like A HORROR MOVIE , to THIS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had never been around a bunch of gunfire and REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE is what really scared OK MRS. ENGLISH because everybody carried A GUN .
A GUN 's like who do AN OLD PERSON not know A GUN do n't have A GUN .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE would pull A GUN out at any time and just go firing at somebody .
A GUN 's like hey - .
WE actually stood here , OK MRS. ENGLISH and MY GRANDKIDS were out here one day playing basketball right here at WE front gate .
Where AN OLD PERSON parked at but on EIGHT WEEKS OF VACATION .
A GUY THAT SHOT THROUGH MY CAR OUT THERE ONE DAY , SHOOTING AT SOMEBODY ELSE was coming down the side street-where AN OLD PERSON saw OK MRS. ENGLISH at first-on the back of this pick up truck .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know WHAT HAPPENED BUT IT WAS A COUPLE THAT USED TO LIVE IN THIS HOUSE NEXT DOOR , THE LITTLE GREY HOUSE NEXT DOOR .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know what happened but when A GUY THAT SHOT THROUGH MY CAR OUT THERE ONE DAY , SHOOTING AT SOMEBODY ELSE came down on THE BACK OF THE TRUCK and got right in THE FRONT OF THE CLASS LIKE SHOW US OFF A GUY THAT SHOT THROUGH MY CAR OUT THERE ONE DAY , SHOOTING AT SOMEBODY ELSE opened fire and just shot A GUY THAT SHOT THROUGH MY CAR OUT THERE ONE DAY , SHOOTING AT SOMEBODY ELSE up on THE BACK OF THE TRUCK .

THE BACK OF THE TRUCK was like THIS RAGGEDY OLD CAR was going THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT and A TRUCK - .
THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN was going THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT and THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN was going THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT .
THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT 's THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT .
THE GUY ON THE TRUCK did n't know THE GUY ON THE TRUCK was going to get shot .
THE GUY ON THE TRUCK had A GUN too .
THE GUY ON THE TRUCK shot HIS INTESTINES out .
GOODNESS .
GOODNESS . must 've been really traumatizing for YOUR grandchildren .
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN could n't stay here for A MONTH or TWO O'CLOCK .
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN knew THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN .
They guy used to come here and take MY GRANDKIDS to THE STORE and take MY GRANDKIDS to OPTIMIST PARK .
THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN did n't know THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN .
Anyway , THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN lived .

THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN 's living .
THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN made it .
But HIS INTESTINES-AND THAT WAS MY GRANDKIDS .
MY GRANDKIDS could n't believe HIS INTESTINES-AND THAT WAS MY GRANDKIDS .
When THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN fell of THE BACK OF THE TRUCK across Hawthorne-it was like MY MOTHER got there .
MY MOTHER used to live right down ONLY ONE STREET .
By MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MY MOTHER got there and MY GRANDKIDS pulled THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN off the pavement .
THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN rolled off THE BACK OF THE TRUCK .

THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN lived .
THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN still living .
YOUR desire for home ownership is what kept YOUR here during all this .
THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT 's THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT that OK MRS. ENGLISH stayed is THE HOME OWNERSHIP .
THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT OK MRS. ENGLISH can do what OK MRS. ENGLISH want to do to THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't have to worry about OK MRS. ENGLISH neighbor 's car being nowhere to park because in apartments and condos-that was A CONDO , HONDURAS OFF OF SUGAR CREEK were condos at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
If AN OLD PERSON do n't get home at A CERTAIN TIME AN OLD PERSON got to OPTIMIST PARK because AN OLD PERSON do n't have a specific parking space .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm telling AN OLD PERSON A CERTAIN TIME 's really murder .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't see how REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE live in CONDOS AND APARTMENTS .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE irks OK MRS. ENGLISH .
OK MRS. ENGLISH daughters , MY TWO DAUGHTERS live in HONDURAS APARTMENTS . .
When OK MRS. ENGLISH go down to MY TWO DAUGHTERS house , oh I be so mad because REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE just park REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE want to park .
MY TWO DAUGHTERS park in front of y our door like MY TWO DAUGHTERS live here and AN OLD PERSON live FOUR DOORS down .
Why would AN OLD PERSON park in FRONT OF SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE ? Give OK MRS. ENGLISH A BREAK .
Just to own something .
FRONT OF SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE is basically why OK MRS. ENGLISH stayed , to own FRONT OF SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
To just see what OK MRS. ENGLISH could do with FRONT OF SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
THE LADY THAT I GOT IT FROM , BASICALLY TO KEEP IT FOR HER .
THE ONLY ONE THAT SHE COULD SAVE OUT OF-I THINK SHE SAID SHE HAD SEVEN is THE ONLY ONE THAT SHE COULD SAVE OUT OF-I THINK SHE SAID SHE HAD SEVEN .
And THE ONLY ONE THAT SHE COULD SAVE OUT OF-I THINK SHE SAID SHE HAD SEVEN was BLANCH PERRY WHO OWNED IT ORIGINALLY ?
Yeah .
And YOUR said BLANCH PERRY WHO OWNED IT ORIGINALLY was the OUR FIRST African-American in THIS AREA BELMONT .
Yes .
Was there a particular moment or event that really influenced YOUR in becoming sort of A NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVIST .
YOUR had been working very hard on YOUR own house-when did YOUR begin really working on neighborhood issues ?
After THE POLICE department raided OK MRS. ENGLISH house .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE really pissed me-excuse the language .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE irritated THE POLICE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH did n't know there was SUCH THINGS AS AN ASSOCIATION .
Nobody informed OK MRS. ENGLISH .
Nobody went to THE MEETINGS that OK MRS. ENGLISH knew of .
THEY would always ride PAST here and THEY would see OK MRS. ENGLISH in MY BACK YARD UP AGAINST MY HOUSE OR ALL THE WAY .
OK MRS. ENGLISH asked THEY one day .
When do AN OLD PERSON all have THE MEETINGS and whatever ? We have THEY blah , blah , blah but anybody ca n't come at THAT PARTICULAR TIME .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like okay , A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE .
THEY did n't know OK MRS. ENGLISH .
THEY used to think A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE was A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE .
A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE was OK MRS. ENGLISH and OK MRS. ENGLISH TWO O'CLOCK daughters .
ME AND MY TWO DAUGHTERS would always see OK MRS. ENGLISH in OK MRS. ENGLISH yard .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would always be in the yard messing with FLOWERS OR SOMETHING in MY BACK YARD UP AGAINST MY HOUSE OR ALL THE WAY .
THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT irritated me when THE POLICE raided OK MRS. ENGLISH house for THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT .
Then on top of that ME AND MY TWO DAUGHTERS did n't raid OK MRS. ENGLISH house .
ME AND MY TWO DAUGHTERS had THIS GUY 'S NAME on a warrant .
ME AND MY TWO DAUGHTERS were calling A GUY THAT SHOT THROUGH MY CAR OUT THERE ONE DAY , SHOOTING AT SOMEBODY ELSE OK MRS. ENGLISH sons which ME AND MY TWO DAUGHTERS know OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't have sons .
OK MRS. ENGLISH have TWO O'CLOCK daughters .
MY TWO DAUGHTERS kept saying WE want AN OLD PERSON sons .
WE want AN OLD PERSON sons .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't have any sons .
THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT irritated OK MRS. ENGLISH .
OK MRS. ENGLISH started going to these community meetings with MY UNIFORM on .
MY UNIFORM
MY UNIFORM threw a wrench in THEIR mouths or whatever .
When OK MRS. ENGLISH would walk in THEIR would go - .
THEIR used to talk about OK MRS. ENGLISH house all the time in the meeting , so OK MRS. ENGLISH heard .
THIS was all THIS talked about was KENNON STREET , 1401 KENNON STREET .
When OK MRS. ENGLISH would walk in THE POLICE OFFICERS ' mouth would be .
THEN THE LADIES - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH used to get a kick out of there just to see what THEN THE LADIES - . talking about .
Then everybody stopped talking .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like , okay AN OLD PERSON all have a nice day .
Then from there OK MRS. ENGLISH went to - .
If AN OLD PERSON 're not going to do anything about THE CRIME , THE LEAST WE CAN DO - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH formed a crime watch program .
On KENNON STREET , 1401 KENNON STREET or THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN GENERAL ?
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN GENERAL
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN GENERAL was in 2000 .
How did YOUR go about THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN GENERAL ? Did YOUR knock on FOUR DOORS ?
WE had to go through THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS PROGRAM THEY HAVE where AN OLD PERSON can get the training to start THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS PROGRAM THEY HAVE .
THEY come out and show AN OLD PERSON how to set up THE COMMUNITY WATCH , tell AN OLD PERSON what AN OLD PERSON have to do .
WE had to go street to street .
WE had to get eighty percent of signatures .
Then WE had to have THE POLICE OFFICERS GO WITH US to knock on THESE PEOPLES ' DOORS because THE COMMUNITY WATCH was THE COMMUNITY WATCH .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think THE COMMUNITY WATCH was to irritate REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE .
THE COMMUNITY WATCH really made WE stick out like sore thumbs , AN OLD PERSON know , with THE POLICE OFFICER , walking with THE POLICE OFFICER .
WE got 433 signatures .
433 took WE - .
WE started in NOVEMBER of ' 99 , OK MRS. ENGLISH believe , during the holidays and stuff but WE finished NOVEMBER up .
WE started NOVEMBER .
WE used to have monthly meetings .
WE association at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY was running on TWO O'CLOCK people which they never involved nobody .
OK MRS. ENGLISH wanted to know what was going on .
OK MRS. ENGLISH wanted to know how OUR ASSOCIATION AT THAT TIME functioned .
OK MRS. ENGLISH wanted to know how everything about THIS AREA BELMONT became how THIS AREA BELMONT is .
OK MRS. ENGLISH was really irritated because THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE and A NEIGHBORHOOD so run down .
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE 's THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE .
Why do n't y' all do something ? Why do n't THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE Why ca n't AN OLD PERSON find something to do ? Why ca n't AN OLD PERSON make somebody come in and help AN OLD PERSON clean THIS AREA BELMONT up ? Why do WE have to hide behind WE doors for gunfire ? Why ca n't WE sit on WE porches when THIS get dark ? WE should be able to do SUCH THINGS AS AN ASSOCIATION .
WE kids should be able to play without seeing people getting shot to death and stuff of that nature .
THE CRIME WATCH was THE CRIME WATCH .
In the process of doing THE CRIME WATCH YOUR must have talked with a lot of THE RESIDENTS .
A lot of REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE .
Did YOUR get A BETTER SENSE than YOUR had before of what some of REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE concerns and needs were ?
Yeah .
A BETTER SENSE was - .
Well , OK MRS. ENGLISH still do .
THEY are afraid .
A LOT OF THEM were afraid because AN OLD PERSON call THE POLICE OFFICER and THEY do n't come .
AN OLD PERSON call THE POLICE OFFICER and then THEY come to AN OLD PERSON house .
THIS was mainly what OK MRS. ENGLISH was hearing .
THE POLICE OFFICER would come and knock on THE BACK DOOR and let the drug house right next door - .
AN OLD PERSON call THE POLICE OFFICERS GO WITH US and A LOT OF CONCERNS and then THE POLICE OFFICERS GO WITH US come over and talk to THE POLICE OFFICERS GO WITH US .
A LOT OF CONCERNS was A LOT OF CONCERNS .
A LOT OF PEOPLE really want-had A LOT - .
WE had a lot going on back then .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE was coming to the crime watch meeting .
WE association was n't really functioning at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
Basically WE would have THE CRIME WATCH with all these people every month .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would have to come up - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH would have to learn how to actually do THE CRIME WATCH .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had never done THE CRIME WATCH before .
We had a person at neighborhood development named JENNIFER PRICE .
JENNIFER PRICE 's not there anymore .
JENNIFER PRICE left .
JENNIFER PRICE basically taught OK MRS. ENGLISH everything OK MRS. ENGLISH needed to know as far as doing active work in A NEIGHBORHOOD ; how to perform certain duties , how to set up AN OLD PERSON by-laws .
JENNIFER PRICE did n't actually do A NEIGHBORHOOD .
JENNIFER PRICE would refer OK MRS. ENGLISH to THE PHONE BOOKS to read and place where OK MRS. ENGLISH could go and meet REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE and talk to REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH started going to community meetings in other neighborhoods and downtown city -LSB- unclear -RSB- , city council .
After OK MRS. ENGLISH had to go to MY FIRST BIG SPEECH - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had to go to MY FIRST BIG SPEECH to get OK MRS. ENGLISH house off the demolishing order .
MY FIRST BIG SPEECH was OK MRS. ENGLISH OUR FIRST time ever hearing about MY FIRST BIG SPEECH , well being at MY FIRST BIG SPEECH .
OK MRS. ENGLISH and BLANCH PERRY WHO OWNED IT ORIGINALLY had to go before MY FIRST BIG SPEECH and actually ask for MYSELF AND MRS. PERRY not to tear SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE down .
MY FIRST BIG SPEECH was OK MRS. ENGLISH OUR FIRST big speech .
How did YOUR feel about going before MYSELF AND MRS. PERRY ?
OK MRS. ENGLISH felt like-well , OK MRS. ENGLISH guess because OK MRS. ENGLISH work with REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH was still at CHARLOTTE AREA TRANSIT .
Talking to PEOPLE EVERYDAY , CHARLOTTE AREA TRANSIT 's just become a natural .
BLANCH PERRY WHO OWNED IT ORIGINALLY had butterflies in BLANCH PERRY WHO OWNED IT ORIGINALLY stomach and BLANCH PERRY WHO OWNED IT ORIGINALLY was just shaking .
Well , PEOPLE EVERYDAY ca n't do nothing but say YES or NO , NO , RIGHT ? AI BASICALLY NOTHING but a group of people and OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm looking at PEOPLE EVERYDAY .
During the times that OK MRS. ENGLISH took SOME TRAININGS in college OK MRS. ENGLISH took oral speaking .
YES teaches AN OLD PERSON , AN OLD PERSON always have to make eye contact when AN OLD PERSON talk to REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know why .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm good at YES because REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE say , `` Oh , AN OLD PERSON stare at REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE so hard . ''
YES 's not that OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm staring .
Basically , OK MRS. ENGLISH can tell what AN OLD PERSON are about by talking to AN OLD PERSON .
AN OLD PERSON expressions on YOUR FACE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH guess that 's being old or whatever .
YOUR FACE was A PIECE OF CAKE for OK MRS. ENGLISH to talk to THEM MY THREE MINUTES .
-LSB- Phone ringing -RSB-
Do YOUR need to get that ?
Nah , THEM 'll call on THE OTHER ONE .
THE OTHER ONE 's probably OK MRS. ENGLISH daughters anyway .
THEM could pause THE OTHER ONE for JUST A - .
-LSB- Recorder is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
SARAH THUESEN 'll continue then .
YOUR FIRST MAJOR PUBLIC SPEAKING was YOUR OUR FIRST major public speaking event ? Is that right ?
Yeah .
OUR FIRST was one of the biggest one OK MRS. ENGLISH ever had .
OK MRS. ENGLISH thought OUR FIRST was fun OK MRS. ENGLISH .
OUR FIRST took OK MRS. ENGLISH TWO DAYS to write this speech about SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE and why OK MRS. ENGLISH did n't think AN OLD PERSON should take MS. CELESTE house .
OUR FIRST was just not right .
OK MRS. ENGLISH went on for MY THREE MINUTES .
Then OK MRS. ENGLISH three minutes was up .
Then SHE got SHE three minutes .
Then all of sudden they made a decision in a couple of TWO DAYS .
`` WELL , MRS. ENGLISH WE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXTENSION . ''
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like , `` Thank AN OLD PERSON . ''
`` WELL , MRS. ENGLISH WE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXTENSION . '' went from there .
Then , before OK MRS. ENGLISH could actually-before OK MRS. ENGLISH could move into SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE or complete the code section of SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE , MY FIRST BIG SPEECH came to OK MRS. ENGLISH house .
OK MRS. ENGLISH gave THEM so much trouble .
OK MRS. ENGLISH called THEM .
OK MRS. ENGLISH really went all out with THEM .
Any and everything OK MRS. ENGLISH had A QUESTION ABOUT I called THEM .
If AN OLD PERSON got a problem with THIS THEN HOW CAN I FIX IT ? Where can OK MRS. ENGLISH go ? OK MRS. ENGLISH think OK MRS. ENGLISH sort of got on THIS THEN HOW CAN I FIX IT ? nerve .
Finally , THIS THEN HOW CAN I FIX IT ? said , `` OK MRS. ENGLISH WE going to come and see SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
WE got to see SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE . ''
THIS THEN HOW CAN I FIX IT ? all came with THE CODE ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE .
MY FIRST BIG SPEECH ?
Some of the members of MY FIRST BIG SPEECH .
Pat Cannon .
PATRICK CANNON came CHRISTMAS DAY .
PATRICK CANNON was here at THAT PARTICULAR TIME .
OK MRS. ENGLISH forgot THIS GUY 'S NAME , THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN died .
Stan - .
What 's THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN , THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN died at work .
SARAH THUESEN 'm not sure who THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN would be .
THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN 's A BLACK GUY .
A BLACK GUY used to be on MY FIRST BIG SPEECH .
A BLACK GUY died at work .
A BLACK GUY was in THE SAME OLD DIRTY BATHROOM .
OK MRS. ENGLISH ca n't think of A BLACK GUY name .
A BLACK GUY brother was on city council at MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE was just A BUNCH OF GIRLS LIVE HERE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know the rest of THEM .
THEM came .
THEM said , `` Well , we 'll be there at 2:00 . ''
OK MRS. ENGLISH said , `` Fine OK MRS. ENGLISH 'll be here . ''
2:00 was on a Friday and OK MRS. ENGLISH was getting the braids put in OK MRS. ENGLISH hair .
OK MRS. ENGLISH had to leave .
THEY came in HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET and THEY walked through SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
THEY said , `` OK MRS. ENGLISH , AN OLD PERSON really did a good job .
We still need AN OLD COUNTRY MAN . ''
THEY sent AN OLD COUNTRY MAN out HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET .
This engineer to make - .
THEY kept saying SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE - .
THE CODE ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE kept saying SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was not steady .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was not sturdy .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was unsafe .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think THE BIG GUY OVER CODE ENFORCEMENT 's still there now .
THE BIG GUY OVER CODE ENFORCEMENT 's THE BIG GUY OVER CODE ENFORCEMENT .
What 's THIS GUY 'S NAME ? MR. JENKINS .
Last name is MR. JENKINS .
MR. JENKINS 's got this big beard .
MR. JENKINS rode A BUS too .
MR. JENKINS used to come by HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET and MR. JENKINS would say , `` OK MRS. ENGLISH ca n't keep SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE is going to be demolished .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know why AN OLD PERSON wasting AN OLD PERSON money on MONEY AND YOUR DEVELOPERS . ''
OK MRS. ENGLISH said , `` Just because AN OLD PERSON telling OK MRS. ENGLISH that MONEY AND YOUR DEVELOPERS 's never going down .
AN OLD PERSON do n't ever take anything that OK MRS. ENGLISH has .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't give away stuff .
AN OLD PERSON ca n't take MY STUFF . ''
It was just A HABIT I HAD .
If A HABIT I HAD 's mine AN OLD PERSON not going to take A HABIT I HAD unless OK MRS. ENGLISH give A HABIT I HAD to AN OLD PERSON .
Anyway , this went back and forth and finally AN OLD COUNTRY MAN came out one CHRISTMAS DAY .
AN OLD COUNTRY MAN had to go up in THE ATTIC .
This old man - .
OUR FIRST looked at this old tree OK MRS. ENGLISH had out here that was over a hundred years old .
AN OLD COUNTRY MAN said , `` GOD THAT 'S AN OLD TREE . ''
OK MRS. ENGLISH guess AN OLD COUNTRY MAN was AN OLD COUNTRY MAN because AN OLD COUNTRY MAN was - .
AN OLD COUNTRY MAN knew A LOT OF STUFF about A LOT OF STUFF from THE COUNTRY , far as OK MRS. ENGLISH knew .
Country about THE TREES and FLOWERS OR SOMETHING , because OK MRS. ENGLISH had FLOWERS OR SOMETHING .
AN OLD COUNTRY MAN was naming FLOWERS OR SOMETHING .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like god AN OLD COUNTRY MAN 's been somewhere right .
Then AN OLD COUNTRY MAN went up in THE ATTIC and AN OLD COUNTRY MAN came down .
OK MRS. ENGLISH said , `` Well what 's THE VERDICT ? Do I SAID , `` WELL WHAT 'S THE VERDICT ? tear OK MRS. ENGLISH house down or A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLAH ? '' AN OLD COUNTRY MAN said , `` No , SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE is in good shape .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know why I SAID , `` WELL WHAT 'S THE VERDICT ? keep telling AN OLD PERSON THE VERDICT . ''
THE VERDICT 's when AN OLD COUNTRY MAN told OK MRS. ENGLISH SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE was about SIXTY-FIVE YEARS PLUS old at THAT PARTICULAR TIME .
AN OLD COUNTRY MAN said SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE has been here SIXTY-FIVE YEARS PLUS .
Because of THE STRUCTURE , THE GUY THAT LIVED HERE , PERRY 'S FATHER THAT LIVED HERE , THE WAY HE STRUCTURED THE HOUSE AFTER HE got SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE and redone THE STRUCTURE .
THE GUY THAT LIVED HERE , PERRY 'S FATHER THAT LIVED HERE , THE WAY HE STRUCTURED THE HOUSE AFTER HE did YOUR PAPER WORK on YOUR PAPER WORK .
YOUR PAPER WORK 's like double braced in every corner .
Every part of SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE is double braced .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE withstood Hugo with no damages .
Really .
Wow , SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE 's something .
THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN said THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN had n't never seen nothing like SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE before .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE 's SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE , OK MRS. ENGLISH guess is what SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE is .
THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN braced SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
Every corner has double braces in SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE .
THE GUY , THE PLAZA BUILDING UP TOWN THEY GAVE THIS GUY ? THE BUILDING UPTOWN said AN OLD PERSON do n't find that in AN OLD PERSON new homes .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE 's safe as far as OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm concerned .
THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT upset the code enforcement person .
YOUR think THEY were wanting to find A SORE SPOT to - .
THEY wanted A SORE SPOT demolished .
THEY wanted A SORE SPOT gone because THE POLICE DEPARTMENT had said THE POLICE DEPARTMENT was A HOT SPOT .
SARAH THUESEN see .
A SORE SPOT was A SORE SPOT .
THE DRUG DEALERS GOING TO HANG OUT HERE LONG AS THE HOUSE IS HERE is what THE DRUG DEALERS GOING TO HANG OUT HERE LONG AS THE HOUSE IS HERE said .
Did n't OK MRS. ENGLISH show THE DRUG DEALERS GOING TO HANG OUT HERE LONG AS THE HOUSE IS HERE something ? SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE 's still on ONE CORNER OF MY HOUSE TO THE OTHER CORNER OF MY HOUSE .
Every time OK MRS. ENGLISH see MR. JENKINS uptown , MR. JENKINS 'll say , `` AN OLD PERSON still in THAT OLD HOUSE , OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm still in THAT OLD HOUSE . ''
Talking about god girl .
AN OLD PERSON should have just gave up THESE YEARS WHEN ago .
OK MRS. ENGLISH probably should have .
Financially , OK MRS. ENGLISH should have given up , THESE YEARS WHEN ago .
THESE YEARS WHEN 's so expensive to do repair work now .
THESE YEARS WHEN 's very expensive .
Then THESE YEARS WHEN 's like fast as AN OLD PERSON fix one thing something else is gone .
THIS is wrong with THIS .
THIS 's wrong with THIS .
THIS 's A MESS .
THIS 's still worth THIS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know .
THIS 's still worth THE HOME OWNERSHIP .
During THESE YEARS WHEN YOUR were getting more involved in THIS AREA BELMONT , do YOUR start to see YOUR as an activist ?
NO , NO .
OK MRS. ENGLISH saw OK MRS. ENGLISH as somebody that would speak THEIR MIND .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't call THEIR MIND an activist because if OK MRS. ENGLISH see and OK MRS. ENGLISH dislike THEIR MIND OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm going to say something , especially about OK MRS. ENGLISH neighborhood .
THEIR MIND 's like people used to - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH friends used to would n't come and see OK MRS. ENGLISH because of OK MRS. ENGLISH neighborhood .
MY FRIENDS USED TO said , `` Oh , god , OK MRS. ENGLISH ca n't come there . ''
People at OK MRS. ENGLISH work would say , `` How do AN OLD PERSON live in that old gunshot alley neighborhood ? '' OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like we going to do something about YOUR PAPER WORK .
YOUR PAPER WORK just takes MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY .
OK MRS. ENGLISH guess AN OLD PERSON could say OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm A NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVIST .
OK MRS. ENGLISH just say OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm concerned because THIS , BUT NOTHING 'S EVER BEEN DONE is where OK MRS. ENGLISH want to be for NOW , maybe not forever but for this particular minute THIS , BUT NOTHING 'S EVER BEEN DONE is mine .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't feel like OK MRS. ENGLISH should have to be run off ONLY ONE STREET by A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD or a bunch of people who want to walk downtown that should 've been already here and help keep THIS AREA BELMONT up to par .
A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD was A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD back in THE '60S , LATE '60S SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD was real nice .
Then AN OLD PERSON white people move out .
Then A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD goes to the dogs .
Then all of sudden , oh , OK MRS. ENGLISH want to live up there and OK MRS. ENGLISH want to walk downtown .
Come on NOW .
Give OK MRS. ENGLISH A BREAK .
A BREAK 's not fair .
They moved THE BLACKS HERE out of THE CITY , ALL THIS at one time .
Moved US out to the suburbs .
US was back in THE EARLY '70S OK MRS. ENGLISH believe .
Are YOUR talking about the Urban Renewal ?
Yeah .
THEY moved everybody out THE WAY HE STRUCTURED THE HOUSE AFTER HE .
THEY 's when OK MRS. ENGLISH went out to PINE VALLEY .
Then all of a sudden THEY let US come back into THE CITY , ALL THIS .
Now THEY 're telling US , `` Oh US want THE HOUSES . ''
THE CITY , ALL THIS 's like every neighborhood surrounding YOUR DOWNTOWN AREA has been either targeted or revitalizing .
What do THEY call THE CITY , ALL THIS ? Gentrification .
THE CITY , ALL THIS 's exactly what THE CITY , ALL THIS is .
GENTRIFICATION .
WE know GENTRIFICATION . .
WE been knowing GENTRIFICATION . for THESE YEARS WHEN .
GENTRIFICATION . has n't been that obvious .
Now , GENTRIFICATION . 's very obvious .
What do YOUR fear is going to be lost if THE GENTRIFICATION PROCESS continues here in THIS AREA BELMONT ?
The neighborhood THE GENTRIFICATION PROCESS .
The houses because everything is going to CONDOMINIUMS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't think SO MANY PEOPLE care about YOUR NEW HOMES anymore .
Everybody wants to be where SO MANY PEOPLE do n't have to do anything , just pay THE RENT , pay AN OLD PERSON bills .
Let somebody else do YOUR PAPER WORK .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think A LOT OF PEOPLE are lazy .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE do n't want FLOWERS OR SOMETHING .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE do n't want to have a space of YOUR OWN .
Then AN OLD PERSON have a lot of SINGLE PEOPLE that live by SINGLE PEOPLE .
Maybe SINGLE PEOPLE are afraid to live in a house .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't know .
OK MRS. ENGLISH feel like eventually SINGLE PEOPLE will lose - .
A LOT OF THESE HOMES will be destroyed simply because SINGLE PEOPLE want CONDOS AND APARTMENTS .
SINGLE PEOPLE have THE FUNDS , the means to do THE FUNDS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH feel like SINGLE PEOPLE are very sneaky with A LOT OF THESE HOMES .
We went through A YEAR or ALMOST TWO YEARS to get A BELMONT PLAN in place .
Now AN OLD PERSON virtually do n't hear anything about A YEAR .
A YEAR 's always the Hope VI Plan and like what happened to A BELMONT PLAN ? Everything was altered .
When YOUR refer to A BELMONT PLAN are YOUR referring to that 2003 report that came out ? The Belmont Revitalization plan THE CITY , ALL THIS had for THIS AREA BELMONT ?
Yes .
May 12 , 2003 .
YOUR were THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
Yeah , WE were the-what do THEY call it-the stake holders .
THE SIX STAKE HOLDERS THAT NEVER MISSED A MEETING FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS TO GET THE PLAN TOGETHER AS THEY said .
Then all of a sudden there was A LOT OF CHANGES that WE were n't aware of .
A LOT OF CHANGES took WE about A YEAR to get the new , original books .
The new-what do THE SIX STAKE HOLDERS THAT NEVER MISSED A MEETING FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS TO GET THE PLAN TOGETHER AS THEY call them-books .
WE had THE ORIGINAL PLAN BOOK .
Then THE SIX STAKE HOLDERS THAT NEVER MISSED A MEETING FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS TO GET THE PLAN TOGETHER AS THEY edit THE ORIGINAL PLAN BOOK , some of the material .
WE never got that one .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think WE got that ONE LAST YEAR , THAT PARTICULAR YEAR before , ONE LAST YEAR .
YOUR felt like THE CITY , ALL THIS was making changes THE RESIDENTS did n't want .
THE RESIDENTS made THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT CHANGES that WE were n't aware of .
THE RESIDENTS excuse for THE RESIDENTS was WE had to do THEIR EXCUSE FOR THAT and WE had to do THEIR EXCUSE FOR THAT in X amount of time .
WE did n't have MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY to come back to AN OLD PERSON all .
Give SARAH THUESEN an example of a change that YOUR were n't in favor of .
The Hope VI . Everything about THE HOPE VI was - .
In fact WE were doing A BELMONT PLAN when they were trying to do a Hope VI plan at THAT PARTICULAR TIME .
A BELMONT PLAN was like A BELMONT PLAN was A BELMONT PLAN .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IT was working on THE PIEDMONT COURT PEOPLE .
WE used to go there and try to get THE PIEDMONT COURT PEOPLE into the neighborhood to be a part of the neighborhood meetings .
THE PIEDMONT COURT PEOPLE would always say THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IT is starting WE up a community organization .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IT doing THIS , BUT NOTHING 'S EVER BEEN DONE and blah , blah , blah .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IT was like THIS , BUT NOTHING 'S EVER BEEN DONE would be going to THE HOPE VI .
WE would be going to the THIS AREA BELMONT plant .
A GOOD MOMENT FOR ME TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT PIEDMONT COURTS was going on simultaneously at THE LATE '60S , EARLY '70S .
A GOOD MOMENT FOR ME TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT PIEDMONT COURTS will be A GOOD MOMENT FOR ME TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT PIEDMONT COURTS .
When YOUR OUR FIRST moved here how much contact did YOUR have with THE RESIDENTS over in THE PIEDMONT COURTS ?
WE used to give THE RESIDENTS THE FLYERS IN THERE every month .
WE used to give flyers and crime watch .
When OK MRS. ENGLISH started the crime watch WE used to take THE FLYERS IN THERE because a lot of REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE - .
Oh , THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE loved THE CRIME WATCH NEWSLETTER because WE 'd put in THERE WHO GOT CAUGHT FOR WHAT .
The OUR FIRST thing THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE would say , `` Oh , OK MRS. ENGLISH told AN OLD PERSON OK MRS. ENGLISH know THERE WHO GOT CAUGHT FOR WHAT .
THERE WHO GOT CAUGHT FOR WHAT 's been doing DRUGS ALL DAY . ''
This went on .
WE were actually get THE BEST THING from THE POLICE DEPARTMENT and put THE BEST THING in THE CRIME WATCH NEWSLETTER .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE loved THE BEST THING .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE thought THE BEST THING was THE BEST THING .
`` When AN OLD PERSON all going to do ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE NEWSLETTERS ? '' WE used to go down there and talk to REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE and try to see if WE could get REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE to combine .
WE felt like REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE felt like REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE were separate .
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE NEWSLETTERS 's always been like THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like , is Piedmont Courts not in THIS AREA BELMONT ? THIS AREA BELMONT always made AN OLD PERSON feel like it was just THE PIEDMONT COURTS and then AN OLD PERSON got THIS AREA BELMONT .
THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE got THIS HOPE VI THING now .
THE ONLY REASON WE DID N'T GET SHOT feels like there is THIS AREA BELMONT .
THE HOPE VI 's just THE HOPE VI and THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
THE HOPE VI 's all AN OLD PERSON hear .
THE HOPE VI and THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
THE PIEDMONT COURTS is THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
THE PIEDMONT COURTS 's simple .
Get over THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
Why do n't THIS AREA BELMONT THEY CHANGING THE NAMES OF EVERYTHING .
THIS AREA BELMONT 's like THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IT has taken over THIS AREA BELMONT .
Basically , to do whatever THEY CHANGING THE NAMES OF EVERYTHING see fit and whenever THEY CHANGING THE NAMES OF EVERYTHING decide .
In working with THE FOLKS and getting to know some of the folks who lived over in THE PIEDMONT COURTS and were THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS different from THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS YOUR heard from people in THIS AREA BELMONT outside of THE PIEDMONT COURTS ?
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE , REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE were - .
A LOT OF THEM did n't have HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS and REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE was just trying to go back to school to get HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE were trying to get SOME TRAININGS , JOB TRAINING .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE were told that REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE could get SOME TRAININGS , JOB TRAINING and high school diploma and SOME TRAININGS , JOB TRAINING would make REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE ready to relocate back into some of HONDURAS APARTMENTS . once HONDURAS APARTMENTS . are ready .
For the Hope VI YOUR mean ?
For something .
At MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY was n't nothing .
MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY was just - .
Even before THE HOPE SIX .
THEY tried THE HOPE SIX ALMOST TWO YEARS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think THEY failed at the grant that THEY did ALMOST TWO YEARS before .
The grant that THEY had previously applied for THEY did n't get .
Then THEY retired again in 2003 .
THE ONE WHO YOU THINK , ONE took THEY THAT PARTICULAR YEAR to get right .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think THEY had a lot of help from THE CITY , ALL THIS .
What was THE PIEDMONT COURTS ? Just describe to GENERAL .
GUNSHOT ALLEY .
THE PIEDMONT COURTS was terrible .
People shooting , killing .
DRUGS ALL DAY
Kids running wild .
THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD was awful , almost like - .
THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD was THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD but THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD was like it was condensed because it was HONDURAS APARTMENTS . .
THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD was just like this big old neighborhood .
GUNSHOT ALLEY .
THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD was just condensed .
It was more condensed because everybody lived within THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
So , what would YOUR say to someone A POOR EXCUSE FOR THE CITY AND CHARLOTTE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO TEAR DOWN TO REMODEL FOR CONDOS , if there is so much violence then A POOR EXCUSE FOR THE CITY AND CHARLOTTE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO TEAR DOWN TO REMODEL FOR CONDOS should be torn down . ''
To OK MRS. ENGLISH , A POOR EXCUSE FOR THE CITY AND CHARLOTTE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO TEAR DOWN TO REMODEL FOR CONDOS 's not A POOR EXCUSE FOR THE CITY AND CHARLOTTE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO TEAR DOWN TO REMODEL FOR CONDOS .
To OK MRS. ENGLISH , A POOR EXCUSE FOR THE CITY AND CHARLOTTE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO TEAR DOWN TO REMODEL FOR CONDOS was A POOR EXCUSE FOR THE CITY AND CHARLOTTE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO TEAR DOWN TO REMODEL FOR CONDOS .
A POOR EXCUSE FOR THE CITY AND CHARLOTTE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO TEAR DOWN TO REMODEL FOR CONDOS 's what OK MRS. ENGLISH feel .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't think A POOR EXCUSE FOR THE CITY AND CHARLOTTE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO TEAR DOWN TO REMODEL FOR CONDOS 's got anything to do with THE CRIME , THE LEAST WE CAN DO .
Then THE PIEDMONT COURTS had been remodeled THIS JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS .
They started remodeling THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
OH REALLY ?
OK MRS. ENGLISH had A FRIEND THAT LIVED IN ONE OF THEM THAT HAD BEEN REMODELED .
What do YOUR think of ONE OF THEM THAT HAD BEEN REMODELED ?
It was nice because ONE OF THEM THAT HAD BEEN REMODELED went in , OH REALLY insulated ONE OF THEM THAT HAD BEEN REMODELED .
A FRIEND THAT LIVED IN ONE OF THEM THAT HAD BEEN REMODELED had the sheet rock walls not the brick walls .
A FRIEND THAT LIVED IN ONE OF THEM THAT HAD BEEN REMODELED had new walls .
OH REALLY redone THE BANISTERS , THE BANISTERS .
It was really nice .
OH REALLY are doing THIS JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS before THIS JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS 's going to be torn down ?
Well , yeah , before OK MRS. ENGLISH even heard anything about a Hope SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SHE JUST SWEEPING .
She was living in one of them .
Then all of a sudden AN OLD PERSON start saying , well OH REALLY .
OH REALLY just did n't take CARE OF THE FARM .
What do YOUR wish THE CITY , ALL THIS had done with THE PIEDMONT COURTS ?
To OK MRS. ENGLISH , OH REALLY should have gutted OH REALLY and remodeled OH REALLY and left OH REALLY as is .
THE CITY , ALL THIS does n't own OH REALLY .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IT owns OH REALLY so OH REALLY say .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IT OH REALLY are doing THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IT all over THE CITY , ALL THIS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think OH REALLY want to get away from public housing which OH REALLY say OH REALLY got new ones that OH REALLY 've already put up like Oaklawn on the OPTIMIST PARK and Arbor Glen .
OH REALLY are real pretty .
OH REALLY are real pretty , pretty , pretty .
There are still project REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE .
IT 's not obvious .
IT just makes IT - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think what REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE do IT REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE single out A LOT OF PEOPLE .
There 's no way A LOT OF PEOPLE can make the income to go back into HONDURAS APARTMENTS . .
We question what is A SLIDING SCALE , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH , WHICH IT IS .
Well , A SLIDING SCALE , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH , WHICH IT IS 's A SLIDING SCALE , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH , WHICH IT IS .
If REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE got to compete with just ordinary people REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE do n't have-some of the did n't have HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE did n't have MUCH JOB EXPERIENCES .
What make AN OLD PERSON think REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE are going to come back and qualify ? If REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE had THE POLICE OFFICERS GO WITH US , THE POLICE OFFICER mainly visited every apartment there once upon a time .
If AN OLD PERSON got a police record what makes AN OLD PERSON think REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE going to qualify to come back .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE targeted THE PIEDMONT COURTS because AN OLD PERSON got AN OLD FOURTH WARD UP HERE .
OK MRS. ENGLISH mean , god , AN OLD PERSON got REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE old big fancy condos stuck out back there and AN OLD PERSON look back there and AN OLD PERSON see old raggedy , gun down , THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
Then AN OLD PERSON come on up and see the old raggedy , dilapidated houses in THIS AREA BELMONT .
Naturally , THE PIEDMONT COURTS had to be OUR FIRST .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE had to go .
REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE had talked about putting A BUFFER there when WE was doing WE plan .
Put a buffer between-what is THAT ? - PIEDMONT COURTS .
Well 277 THEY WANTED TO PUT A BUFFER THERE , 277 THEY WANTED TO PUT A BUFFER THERE , 277 THEY WANTED TO PUT A BUFFER THERE .
Like a barrier of some sort ?
THAT ? - PIEDMONT COURTS said THE TREES , a line of trees for A BUFFER .
A BUFFER FOR THE NOISE .
We knew A BUFFER FOR THE NOISE . was to hide THE PIEDMONT COURTS really is what THE PIEDMONT COURTS was for .
THAT ? - PIEDMONT COURTS did n't want people riding PAST and see THE PROJECTS .
To hide PAST from view .
Yeah .
Because THESE PEOPLE DOWN HERE IN FOURTH WARD , THESE PEOPLE DOWN HERE IN FOURTH WARD looking out THE WHOLE BACK DOOR .
What are THESE PEOPLE DOWN HERE IN FOURTH WARD looking AT-PIEDMONT COURTS , right ? OK MRS. ENGLISH think AT-PIEDMONT COURTS 's what THE WHOLE BACK DOOR mainly amounted to which is sad .
What do YOUR think SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE and the building of this new Hope VI project is ultimately going to mean for THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE ?
SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE 's going to mean AN OLD PERSON got HIGH PRICE CONDOS .
SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE 's about SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE .
Really , SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE 's like SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE always has been .
SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE 's going to be THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE 's singled out .
SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE 's not like they are doing SUCH THINGS AS AN ASSOCIATION to the whole neighborhood .
SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE 's mainly SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE .
THE HOPE VI THINGS are THE HOPE VI THINGS .
THE HOPE VI THINGS 's on SIEGLE AVENUE , PIEDMONT COURTS , SIEGLE AVENUE .
Everything else has been dropped .
WE are working on WE .
WE are doing a wet contract .
WE are doing a dry contract .
WE going to do THIS , BUT NOTHING 'S EVER BEEN DONE .
YOUR think all the attention 's going to be - ?
SARAH THUESEN see .
THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD will get kind of NEGLECTED .
Yeah , until - .
OK MRS. ENGLISH think what is happening is everything is on hold until NEGLECTED see how many of us NEGLECTED can get rid of .
THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD 'll make THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD much easier for NEGLECTED to move in for the kill as OK MRS. ENGLISH say , to take over .
THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD 's not as easy when AN OLD PERSON are messing with HOMEOWNERS and as THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD is when AN OLD PERSON got renters .
Like the apartment people , like THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
THE PIEDMONT COURTS 's different when AN OLD PERSON come out here and AN OLD PERSON got home owners , especially when AN OLD PERSON got a mouth like OK MRS. ENGLISH running SUCH THINGS AS AN ASSOCIATION around THIS AREA BELMONT .
THE PIEDMONT COURTS 's very hard to just come in HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET and do anything AN OLD PERSON want to do .
OK MRS. ENGLISH hate the thought that HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET are putting HIGH PRICE CONDOS down there .
Then WE heard last night at A MEETING , HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET are wanting to put CONDOS AND APARTMENTS on DAVIDSON STREET WHICH IS OVER IN OPTIMIST PARK .
WE got a person just interested in putting in condos on Van Every which is right up ONLY ONE STREET from THE PIEDMONT COURTS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm like , come on .
Why would THE want to put CONDOS AND APARTMENTS in THE MIDST OF A MOVE WHERE WE-ONE FARM - .
Then THE said no , THE look more like row houses .
Why would AN OLD PERSON want to put THAT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD ? OK MRS. ENGLISH said god after a while we going to have THAT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD coming from everywhere talking about these little needle in a haystack condominiums sites .
THAT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD just popping up everywhere .
Everybody wants to put A CONDO now .
A CONDO 's been said that this whole area would be CONDOMINIUMS .
OK MRS. ENGLISH call A CONDO stacking , warehousing people is what A CONDO is .
A CONDO 's stacking MORE PEOPLE on top of REAL-SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE to get MORE PEOPLE closer to downtown .
MORE PEOPLE 'll do anything to be near downtown for some reason .
OK MRS. ENGLISH do n't even like downtown .
OK MRS. ENGLISH be downtown .
OK MRS. ENGLISH never go down there when OK MRS. ENGLISH 'm off .
OK MRS. ENGLISH ca n't stand downtown .
Then A BIG CHANGE THAN WHAT IT USED TO BE 's nicer than what A BIG CHANGE THAN WHAT IT USED TO BE used to be downtown .
A BIG CHANGE THAN WHAT IT USED TO BE 's A BIG CHANGE THAN WHAT IT USED TO BE .
A BIG CHANGE THAN WHAT IT USED TO BE 's alive downtown .
Basically , if SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE had been set fifty miles from HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE probably would have been THE SAME FOR ME .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE 's not THIS AREA BELMONT per se being THIS AREA BELMONT .
SOMEBODY 'S HOUSE 's just THE HOME OWNERSHIP .
SARAH THUESEN realize HERE OR DOWN DAVIDSON STREET are getting a little close on MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY so SARAH THUESEN 'm going to pause this for a minute .
