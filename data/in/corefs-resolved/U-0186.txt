This is a second interview with TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT -
NO , NO 's Legal Aid of NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES .
Legal Aid of NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES .
Today is April eleventh , 2006 .
SARAH THUESEN name is SARAH THUESEN .
SARAH THUESEN am conducting this interview for the Southern Oral History Program .
PART OF OUR LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT is PART OF OUR LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT .
In OUR last interview , OUR were talking about YOUR work with THE CHERRY NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHARLOTTE and how THE RESIDENTS there were fighting to prevent the demolition of THE RESIDENTS neighborhood as part of a community block grant initiative .
YOUR had discussed how YOUR had had SOME SUCCESS WITH THAT EFFORT , partly because of changes in CHARLOTTE politics , CHARLOTTE POLITICS .
SARAH THUESEN wanted to maybe pick up with THAT STORY and extend THAT STORY A LITTLE BIT , and ask YOUR to describe the similar work YOUR did with THE BIDDLEVILLE NEIGHBORHOOD in CHARLOTTE .
Could YOUR tell SARAH THUESEN A LITTLE BIT about what was going on in Biddleville in THE MID-70S and what brought YOUR into work with BIDDLEVILLE ?
Sure , BIDDLEVILLE is BIDDLEVILLE .
THE CATALYST FOR AN ATTEMPT BY AN INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER NAMED LOUISE SELLERS , WHO REACTED TO THAT BY DECIDING TO DO HER OWN DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE AND STARTED HAVING MEETINGS OF RESIDENTS IN CHURCHES was built back in the late 1800s and early 1900s and had mostly fallen into A STATE OF DISREPAIR on most of THE STREETS .
Some of THE STREETS were dominated totally by very low-income rental housing .
There were a few homeowner streets that were very close to JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY , but for THE MOST PART , JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY was JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY and THE MOST PART was THAT ONE .
The main plan as JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY had been adopted in 1975 was to demolish virtually all of the housing , again similar to what had happened in the First Ward urban renewal area in Brooklyn and THE CHERRY COMMUNITY .
What happened in THE CATALYST FOR AN ATTEMPT BY AN INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER NAMED LOUISE SELLERS , WHO REACTED TO THAT BY DECIDING TO DO HER OWN DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE AND STARTED HAVING MEETINGS OF RESIDENTS IN CHURCHES was that a VISTA volunteer project , that had been organized by a part-time professor out at UNC-CHARLOTTE , had sent young VISTA volunteers through THE NEIGHBORHOODS to do surveys of THE RESIDENTS about how THE RESIDENTS felt about the prospect of THE RESIDENTS neighborhood being torn down .
THE CATALYST FOR AN ATTEMPT BY AN INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER NAMED LOUISE SELLERS , WHO REACTED TO THAT BY DECIDING TO DO HER OWN DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE AND STARTED HAVING MEETINGS OF RESIDENTS IN CHURCHES was really THE CATALYST FOR AN ATTEMPT BY AN INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER NAMED LOUISE SELLERS , WHO REACTED TO THAT BY DECIDING TO DO HER OWN DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE AND STARTED HAVING MEETINGS OF RESIDENTS IN CHURCHES .
The essence of JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS meeting was that JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS did not want to be displaced wholesale .
Most of JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS did not want to go into what JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS perceived as dangerous and bad public housing in other parts of THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED would happen to JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS if JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were forced to move .
MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER contacted OUR office for assistance in trying to stop this demolition plan .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT .
THIS was about the end of 1979 and , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , the beginning of 1980 .
At THAT TIME , PEOPLE , OUR had pretty much finished THE LITIGATION IN THE -LSB- MARGARET -RSB- HARRIS - -LSB- MITCHELL -RSB- KANNON SUIT and OUR did n't really see any necessary relationship of THE LITIGATION IN THE -LSB- MARGARET -RSB- HARRIS - -LSB- MITCHELL -RSB- KANNON SUIT to THIS NEW COMMUNITY FIGHT .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT ca n't remember the details about that analysis , but regardless , OUR thought that OUR were probably going to have to have a political solution rather than a legal solution .
So what was interesting about THIS NEW COMMUNITY FIGHT was that THE DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE FOR THAT NEIGHBORHOOD was someone who befriended the administration at JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY and it became clear from dialogue that OUR had , that THE DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE FOR THAT NEIGHBORHOOD thought that THE CITY 'S PLAN FOR DEMOLITION would inure to the benefit of JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY , because THIS would probably be able to get very inexpensive or free land from THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED once THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED had been cleared .
And who was that city representative ?
THIS NEW COMMUNITY FIGHT was CHARLIE DANNELLY , WHO SERVES IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY NOW AS A STATE SENATOR .
So when THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION approached CHARLIE DANNELLY , WHO SERVES IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY NOW AS A STATE SENATOR to try to modify THE CITY 'S PLAN FOR DEMOLITION , CHARLIE DANNELLY , WHO SERVES IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY NOW AS A STATE SENATOR pretty much rebuffed THIS and said there was n't anything wrong with THE CITY 'S PLAN FOR DEMOLITION and THE CITY 'S PLAN FOR DEMOLITION needed to proceed .
Although THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION was somewhat disappointing , what THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION did was make the neighborhood organization even more motivated and angry about the initial lack of sympathy for THIS position .
THIS started taking CARLOADS AND BUSLOADS OF RESIDENTS to THE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS and completely filling the audience to express CARLOADS AND BUSLOADS OF RESIDENTS displeasure with THE CITY 'S PLAN FOR DEMOLITION .
Was LOUISE SELLERS AN INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER NAMED LOUISE SELLERS , WHO REACTED TO THAT BY DECIDING TO DO HER OWN DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE AND STARTED HAVING MEETINGS OF RESIDENTS IN CHURCHES of THIS ?
Oh yes , LOUISE SELLERS was .
LOUISE SELLERS would go door to door and tell PEOPLE THEY NEEDED TO COME OUT .
PEOPLE THEY NEEDED TO COME OUT needed to find babysitters or PEOPLE THEY NEEDED TO COME OUT would bring THE CHILDREN with PEOPLE THEY NEEDED TO COME OUT .
Sometimes there were children of all ages who were coming down to THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED THE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS and packing the room .
After having that done once or twice , THE DECISION BY THE CITY COUNCIL , WHICH WAS NOT MADE IN PUBLIC , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think out of deference to CHARLIE DANNELLY , WHO SERVES IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY NOW AS A STATE SENATOR , was to tell the staff to go negotiate with the community organization about A NEW PLAN so that nobody would lose face .
The upshot of THE DECISION BY THE CITY COUNCIL , WHICH WAS NOT MADE IN PUBLIC was that A NEW PLAN was devised and what A NEW PLAN did was save all of the structurally-feasible housing that was in THE CHERRY COMMUNITY .
So instead of demolishing everything , A MORE SELECTIVE ANALYSIS was done to determine the buildings that could be reasonably rehabilitated and saved .
A MORE SELECTIVE ANALYSIS was fairly successful with most of the single-family homes .
The one section that had very small and severely dilapidated housing WE conceded needed to be replaced and what WE were able to do there was negotiate for a brand-new apartment complex to be owned and operated by THE HOUSING AUTHORITY , where RESIDENTS IN CHURCHES would have the FIRST right to apply and live there .
What that ended up doing was providing housing that was actually more affordable than SOME OF THE PREVIOUSLY-OWNED SUBSTANDARD HOUSING , WHERE SOME OF THOSE LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WERE PAYING MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR NET INCOME FOR REALLY BAD HOUSES and having to pay THEIR OWN UTILITIES .
By getting public housing , THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY limited THE TENANTS ' contribution to only thirty percent of THE TENANTS ' net income for RENT AND UTILITIES and THE TENANTS ' got much better housing .
THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY was a lot better than having JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS go to some of THE OLDER PUBLIC HOUSING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY .
So TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think generally speaking , people in THE CHERRY COMMUNITY thought THE CHERRY COMMUNITY was THE CHERRY COMMUNITY and overall preserved BIDDLEVILLE as being a low-income neighborhood , but with better quality housing and with some options .
How do YOUR think CHARLIE DANNELLY , WHO SERVES IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY NOW AS A STATE SENATOR ultimately felt about THE CHERRY COMMUNITY ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that CHARLIE DANNELLY , WHO SERVES IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY NOW AS A STATE SENATOR ended up believing that THE CHERRY COMMUNITY was alright , was fair .
JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY did get SOME PROPERTY THAT WAS ADJACENT TO ITS ATHLETIC FIELD .
As far as TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT can tell , THEY still have n't been able to build anything new on that vacant land THEY got TWENTY-FIVE YEARS ago .
THEY got more land than THEY were able to utilize , but not at a great expense to the neighbors .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that ended up being A PRETTY DECENT OUTCOME ALSO .
A PRETTY DECENT OUTCOME ALSO took ABOUT A YEAR and a half to do THAT IN THE WHOLE PROCESS .
A PRETTY DECENT OUTCOME ALSO also gave BIDDLEVILLE A SENSE that THAT IN THE WHOLE PROCESS could have some power .
At ONE POINT , the director of the city neighborhood development department tried to hire MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER .
At ONE POINT , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT took MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER to see the movie Norma Rae so that MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER could try to get some perspective on what kind of role MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER was playing in this environment .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER appreciated seeing that and could see how THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED would like to get rid of MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER because MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER had A WHOLE LOT more power than MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER imagined .
SARAH THUESEN take THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER refused THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED offer ?
SARAH THUESEN did refuse THE JOB and SARAH THUESEN remained AN INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER NAMED LOUISE SELLERS , WHO REACTED TO THAT BY DECIDING TO DO HER OWN DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE AND STARTED HAVING MEETINGS OF RESIDENTS IN CHURCHES and ended up becoming an entrepreneur in THIS DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION THAT CAME UP WITH SOME FOUNDATION MONEY IN THE 1980S AFTER THAT .
But anyway , THE JOB 's pretty much how THAT ONE turned out .
What was HER BACKGROUND PRIOR TO HER COMMUNITY ACTIVISM ?
MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER was MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER and a single mother who had raised quite A FEW KIDS .
By THE TIME THIS WAS GOING ON , most of A FEW KIDS were teenagers .
So MS. SELLERS , WHICH WE INTERPRETED AS SOMEWHAT OF A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CO-OPT HER had a busy life .
Do YOUR know A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't .
A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT 's okay .
A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT had something to do with `` incubator '' in A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT , but TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT can remember , something about the ` northwest corridor incubator ' something , but TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 'm not sure .
A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT was A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT ?
Yeah , A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT was A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT .
THIS is skipping ahead A LITTLE BIT in chronology , but just to wrap up the CHERRY and BIDDLEVILLE stories , how have those neighborhoods fared over the past twenty-five years since YOUR main work with THIS ?
Well , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't have A VERY DETAILED WORKING KNOWLEDGE of A VERY DETAILED WORKING KNOWLEDGE .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT have watched what happened in CHERRY somewhat from a distance and from reading THINGS THAT ARE IN THE NEWSPAPER .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that CHERRY survived pretty well for about TWENTY-FIVE YEARS , with the neighborhood remaining pretty much intact with a lot of the lower-income and elderly residents still there .
But there have been more commercial encroachments in CHERRY , with SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT OWN LAND , INDIVIDUALS , WERE EVENTUALLY PERSUADED TO SELL OUT TO DEVELOPERS THAT HAVE STARTED TO DEVELOP SOME OTHER PROPERTY ON THE BORDERS .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that the Cherry community organization has not had any great increase in financial support that has enabled SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT OWN LAND , INDIVIDUALS , WERE EVENTUALLY PERSUADED TO SELL OUT TO DEVELOPERS THAT HAVE STARTED TO DEVELOP SOME OTHER PROPERTY ON THE BORDERS to maintain some of that older housing that was rehabilitated in THE LATE 1970S .
So some of THOSE PROPERTIES have kind of worn out , and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 'm afraid that some of THOSE PROPERTIES are going to be lost .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE , has survived quite well .
A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE seems like A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE 's in good shape and is occupied all the time .
A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE was A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE ?
Yeah , A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE was sort of mixed .
A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE had duplexes and fourplexes that were sort of scattered around several streets .
A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE was not A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE .
It was designed to fit in SOMEWHAT WITH THE PRIOR BUILDING STRUCTURES AND STYLES .
YOUR sense is that THE BIDDLEVILLE NEIGHBORHOOD has had a similar trajectory ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think so .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT drive through A SENSE from THE TIME THIS WAS GOING ON and A SENSE looks like to TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT , most of THE HOUSING THAT WAS THERE WHEN THE NEW PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 1980 is still there .
There has not been as much pressure from outside development on BIDDLEVILLE as there has been in CHERRY .
But one of the contiguous neighborhoods has experienced SOME GENTRIFICATION and A SENSE is that if SOME GENTRIFICATION continues , eventually A SENSE may arrive in BIDDLEVILLE too .
But A VERY INTRUSIVE-LOOKING DEVELOPMENT , NO BRICKS , NO HIGH RISE is still in quite good shape and it seems to be completely occupied .
THE MOST PART continues , so THE MOST PART 's another scattered-site success of sorts .
By having only fifty units in ANOTHER FIFTY-UNIT COMPLEX , ANOTHER FIFTY-UNIT COMPLEX makes ANOTHER FIFTY-UNIT COMPLEX more manageable .
In a moment , SARAH THUESEN want to return to the issues of public housing as well as recent gentrification in SEVERAL AREAS OF CHARLOTTE , but SARAH THUESEN thought we might step back A LITTLE BIT right now and talk about some of YOUR more general work in the area of THE TENANTS ' rights and welfare rights .
It might be helpful if YOUR could sketch for SARAH THUESEN sort of the general landscape in THE MID-70S that YOUR encountered that led to YOUR work in SEVERAL AREAS OF CHARLOTTE .
Alright , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 'll try to ME SORT OF THE GENERAL LANDSCAPE IN THE MID-70S describe the landscape in 1974 , THAT TENANT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN NO MONEY , which was the FIRST full calendar ABOUT A YEAR after TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT came to CHARLOTTE .
The low-income housing in CHARLOTTE was in generally extremely bad shape in the private market .
Most of THE LOW-INCOME TENANTS had WEEK-TO-WEEK LEASES and many of THOSE PROPERTIES were oral and not written .
A TYPICAL LEASE would be for THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK and there would be no provision for any kind of THE REPAIRS .
If there were written WEEK-TO-WEEK LEASES at all , THE LOW-INCOME TENANTS would usually be ONE PAGE and ONE PAGE would be very perfunctor .
ONE PAGE would say what the address was , the amount of the rent , and what time RENT AND UTILITIES was due , and RENT AND UTILITIES 's all RENT AND UTILITIES said .
The law in North Carolina at ONE POINT was based upon THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND in the seventeenth century , which has been described in legal jurisprudence as under the doctrine of caveat emptor , or `` the buyer beware , '' which means that THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK was not entitled in common law to have THE LANDLORD make any repairs at all .
What that meant was that THE LOW-INCOME TENANTS could not force THE LANDLORDS ' to do any repairs at all , no matter how serious .
The only potential relief that TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY had at THAT TIME , PEOPLE was to ask for an inspection from a housing inspection department of THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE that enforced THE HOUSING CODE .
But what that meant in practical terms was that if A TENANT requested A HOUSING INSPECTION from THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED , the inspector would come out and might find twenty or TWENTY-FIVE violations of THE HOUSING CODE that would include THE THINGS .
There was actually no requirement that THE LANDLORD provide any heating equipment at that time even in THE HOUSING CODE .
What that would do is cause THE CITY INSPECTOR to send THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY a written complaint and offering THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY the opportunity for a hearing to dispute whether or not those conditions existed .
What would happen in about ninety-eight percent of THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES is the owner would get in touch with THE CITY INSPECTOR property manager and HIS PROPERTY MANAGER would then send a notice for terminating A TYPICAL LEASE to THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK .
Under NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES law at THAT TIME , PEOPLE , the week-to-week tenancy could be terminated on TWO DAYS ' NOTICE .
So if A TYPICAL LEASE began on THE FOLLOWING MONDAY , THE LANDLORD could give TWO DAYS ' NOTICE on FRIDAY to be effective Sunday night , and then on THE FOLLOWING MONDAY , they would be considered a holdover tenant .
It was very common at that time for THE LANDLORDS ' to retaliate by evicting TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY .
So in the same scenario TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 've described , if TWO DAYS ' NOTICE was sent out on FRIDAY , THE LANDLORD would file an action for THE SUMMARY EJECTMENT in the small claims court on THE FOLLOWING MONDAY and that might be scheduled for A TRIAL ON FRIDAY OF THAT SAME WEEK .
Then when THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK would go to A TRIAL ON FRIDAY OF THAT SAME WEEK and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT went to many of these in small claims court , THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK was not entitled to raise as A DEFENSE TO THE SUMMARY EJECTMENT that A DEFENSE TO THE SUMMARY EJECTMENT was in retaliation for having called for A HOUSING INSPECTION .
A TRIAL ON FRIDAY OF THAT SAME WEEK was not A TRIAL ON FRIDAY OF THAT SAME WEEK and there was no statutory right to be protected from RETALIATORY EVICTIONS , WHICH CREATED SUCH A CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT MOST OF THE TENANTS WOULD N'T LET THE INSPECTORS INTO THEIR HOUSES .
So it was very well-known in THE CHERRY COMMUNITY that if a housing inspector came into YOUR home and reported the defects to THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY , that inside of A WEEK , YOUR were likely to be faced with an eviction trial .
So let TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT tell YOUR what happened when JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS had EVICTION TRIALS .
When there was no right to get THE REPAIRS , there was no claim for the tenant to make about having paid rent for dangerous and unhealthy houses and there was no defense for retaliatory eviction .
So when WE had EVICTION TRIALS , THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK would always lose .
When THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET lost , THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET had a theoretical right to appeal for A NEW TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT , but there was a procedural requirement in the NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES statutes that said if A TENANT wanted to appeal A JUDGMENT OF A MAGISTRATE to THE DISTRICT COURT to have a trial in FRONT OF A JURY OR A REAL JUDGE , that THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK would have to pay THREE MONTHS ' rent in advance to stop A JUDGMENT OF A MAGISTRATE from being carried out or executed by THE SHERIFF .
Well , in A PRETTY STRONG CASE , WE had never had any client who had enough money to pay THREE MONTHS ' rent in advance .
WE had plenty of CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE , but none of CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE had enough money saved .
CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE were living pretty much from check to check , so CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE could not afford to pay the rent appeal bond to stop THE LANDLORD from putting CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE out while CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE sought AN APPEAL .
Of course , since CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE did n't have MANY SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS , there was very little reason to need AN APPEAL , but if CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE had any sort of good claim , CLIENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE would surely be displaced before any new trial occurred .
What happened then is , and THIS is going back to the original scenario , if A NEW TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT was scheduled on FRIDAY and THIS lost and THIS could not pay THREE MONTHS ' rent in advance , THE FOLLOWING MONDAY , THE SHERIFF and THE LANDLORD would be at THE HOUSE and THIS would physically remove all of the belongings of THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK and THIS would put THIS out on THE STREET .
Usually every Monday and sometimes every day of THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S , YOUR would drive through the low-income neighborhoods of THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED and YOUR would see all the furniture , THE APPLIANCES , THE TELEVISIONS , EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO THESE FAMILIES , the food , THE APPLIANCES , THE TELEVISIONS , EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO THESE FAMILIES , was put out on THE STREET .
YOUR had PEOPLE WITH PICKUP TRUCKS WHO WERE SCAVENGERS THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND PICK THROUGH THE ITEMS OF THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET AND TAKE THE THINGS THAT THEY WANTED AND JUST CARRY THEM OFF WITH IMPUNITY , WHILE THE TENANTS USUALLY WERE N'T HOME TO PROTECT THEM ; THEY WERE AT WORK AND THEY WERE N'T THERE TO PROTECT THEM .
And PEOPLE WITH PICKUP TRUCKS WHO WERE SCAVENGERS THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND PICK THROUGH THE ITEMS OF THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET AND TAKE THE THINGS THAT THEY WANTED AND JUST CARRY THEM OFF WITH IMPUNITY , WHILE THE TENANTS USUALLY WERE N'T HOME TO PROTECT THEM ; THEY WERE AT WORK AND THEY WERE N'T THERE TO PROTECT THEM did n't necessarily know when RETALIATORY EVICTIONS , WHICH CREATED SUCH A CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT MOST OF THE TENANTS WOULD N'T LET THE INSPECTORS INTO THEIR HOUSES were going to occur , but usually PEOPLE WITH PICKUP TRUCKS WHO WERE SCAVENGERS THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND PICK THROUGH THE ITEMS OF THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET AND TAKE THE THINGS THAT THEY WANTED AND JUST CARRY THEM OFF WITH IMPUNITY , WHILE THE TENANTS USUALLY WERE N'T HOME TO PROTECT THEM ; THEY WERE AT WORK AND THEY WERE N'T THERE TO PROTECT THEM would occur within one or two days after PEOPLE WITH PICKUP TRUCKS WHO WERE SCAVENGERS THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND PICK THROUGH THE ITEMS OF THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET AND TAKE THE THINGS THAT THEY WANTED AND JUST CARRY THEM OFF WITH IMPUNITY , WHILE THE TENANTS USUALLY WERE N'T HOME TO PROTECT THEM ; THEY WERE AT WORK AND THEY WERE N'T THERE TO PROTECT THEM lost in court .
In talking with OTHER FOLKS IN LEGAL AID WORK ACROSS THE REGION , did YOUR find A SIMILAR PATTERN to be A SIMILAR PATTERN ? NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES , how would THE REGION rank or compare to OTHER SOUTHERN STATES or nationally ?
Well , there were n't very many Legal Aid people in THE SOUTH AT THAT TIME .
There were only three counties in NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES and all of us could talk , OTHER FOLKS IN LEGAL AID WORK ACROSS THE REGION could all meet in this same room .
When OTHER FOLKS IN LEGAL AID WORK ACROSS THE REGION would talk , OTHER FOLKS IN LEGAL AID WORK ACROSS THE REGION would realize OTHER FOLKS IN LEGAL AID WORK ACROSS THE REGION all had THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE LANDLORD-TENANT LAW or the complete lack of THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE LANDLORD-TENANT LAW .
So OTHER FOLKS IN LEGAL AID WORK ACROSS THE REGION was very well-known among OTHER FOLKS IN LEGAL AID WORK ACROSS THE REGION three offices .
THE SOUTH AT THAT TIME , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT knew , had similar laws that were mostly THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND from ENGLAND .
Alabama and Mississippi , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , were similar .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did n't know much about GEORGIA and Tennessee .
But GEORGIA was pretty typical in THE SOUTH AT THAT TIME .
It was certainly very different from the law in MASSACHUSETTS that TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had studied under and had practiced with as a law student working with Legal Aid there .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was quite aware that in MASSACHUSETTS , they had a statute that created a right of TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY to get THE REPAIRS and that when THE LANDLORDS ' failed to make REPAIRS , TENANTS HAVING INSPECTIONS DONE BY THE CITY OR HEALTH DEPARTMENT , THE CITY DOING AN INSPECTION ON ITS OWN , TENANTS ATTEMPTING TO ORGANIZE THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS , OR TENANTS EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE STATE STATUTE OR FEDERAL LAW , THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET had A RIGHT TO ESCROW SOME OF THEIR RENT TO HELP PRESSURE THE LANDLORD TO DO THE REPAIRS .
But MASSACHUSETTS was done by statute in MASSACHUSETTS .
Now what compounded JULY OF 1974 was what went on with THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES at THAT TIME , PEOPLE .
The THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES , of course , received money from THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT through THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT , which set up THE AID to Families with Dependent Children , which was THE MAIN CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , AND MEDICAID , WHICH WAS THE RELATIVELY NEW MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , TO COVER FAMILIES THAT QUALIFIED FOR AFDC .
When JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS lost JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS jobs or lost the breadwinner in YOUR HOME , JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS would need to apply for money if JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS had CHILDREN THAT COULD APPLY FOR AFDC .
If YOUR did n't have CHILDREN THAT COULD APPLY FOR AFDC and YOUR were unemployed and YOUR were not disabled , YOUR were n't eligible for anything .
So YOUR HOME 's only the families with CHILDREN THAT COULD APPLY FOR AFDC .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT believe THE GRANT AT THAT TIME IN 1974 FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR , THE GRANT AT THAT TIME IN 1974 FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR , was two hundred dollars per ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE .
AND ONE , was how many FAMILIES THAT CAME TO US WITH THAT PROBLEM came to YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED with what was viewed as A HOUSING OR UTILITIES CRISIS-THAT is A HOUSING OR UTILITIES CRISIS-THAT were behind in A HOUSING OR UTILITIES CRISIS-THAT rent or A HOUSING OR UTILITIES CRISIS-THAT utilities were unpaid and THEIR OWN UTILITIES were either threatened to be terminated or had already been terminated , and THE LANDLORDS ' were threatening to terminate A TYPICAL LEASE for non-payment-was really as a result of THE LANDLORDS ' family having applied for THE AID and having gotten THE DECISION BY THE CITY COUNCIL , WHICH WAS NOT MADE IN PUBLIC from THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT 'S .
There were a couple of FAMILIES THAT CAME TO US WITH THAT PROBLEM , but then the same month , JULY OF 1974 was JULY OF 1974 , AND ONE lady had applied more than ninety days previously and still had not gotten A DECISION .
Another one had applied something like sixty or seventy days .
One of the other lawyers in THE LEGAL AID OFFICE and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT were looking at this and YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED realized , YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED did a little research and found that the federal regulation that governed THE MAIN CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , AND MEDICAID , WHICH WAS THE RELATIVELY NEW MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , TO COVER FAMILIES THAT QUALIFIED FOR AFDC required the local department to make A DECISION within THIRTY DAYS OF THE FAMILY 'S APPLYING FOR HELP .
For JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS , JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS had FORTY-FIVE DAYS to make A DECISION if FORTY-FIVE DAYS was based upon a claim for disability of THE APPLICANT .
When YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED contacted THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT 'S and asked why these applications were pending so long and creating these crises for JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS , THE ANSWER was , well YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED had different answers , but the most common one was the application worker for THIS PARTICULAR CLIENT had gone on maternity leave or had quit and JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS did n't reassign THE CASES to anybody else .
So JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were just sitting there in A FILE DRAWER and nobody was taking any responsibility for A FILE DRAWER .
YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED explained that THIS had caused some severe crises where JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were living in THEIR HOUSES and some of THIS were about to be evicted .
THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT 'S said , `` Well , YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED just ca n't do any better than THIS . ''
So what YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED decided to do was file a civil action in the federal district court in CHARLOTTE seeking injunctive relief to compel THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT 'S to comply with the federal processing standard of making A DECISION within THIRTY DAYS OF THE FAMILY 'S APPLYING FOR HELP , to get THE DECISIONS MADE SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR AT LEAST THE RENT AND THE UTILITIES , to try to not be completely destroyed by eviction .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 've just explained to YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY IS EVICTED .
THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT 'S only remedy for a family that 's been put on THE STREET was to pick up THE CHILDREN and put THE CHILDREN in foster care , which was A WHOLE LOT more expensive than paying THE GRANT AT THAT TIME IN 1974 FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR for A FAMILY OF FOUR .
THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT 'S ONLY REMEDY FOR A FAMILY THAT 'S BEEN PUT ON THE STREET would cost THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT 'S THREE times as much to put THE FAMILY IN FOSTER CARE as THE WELFARE DEPARTMENT 'S ONLY REMEDY FOR A FAMILY THAT 'S BEEN PUT ON THE STREET would be to just grant THE CHILDREN application for THE AID and try to stabilize THE FAMILY IN FOSTER CARE where THE CHILDREN were .
Was this THE ALEXANDER .
v. HILL case ?
Yes HILL CASE is .
HILL CASE was filed in 1974 , THAT TENANT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN NO MONEY .
And who was THE ALEXANDER ?
A YOUNG MOTHER was one of those families that TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT described .
A YOUNG MOTHER name was Clara Alexander and A YOUNG MOTHER was A YOUNG MOTHER .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT ca n't remember exactly how many children A YOUNG MOTHER had .
A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT was not A VERY LARGE FAMILY , but A VERY LARGE FAMILY just did n't have any other source of income at THAT TIME , PEOPLE .
Now A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE were working and then TIMES PEOPLE lose THE JOB and there was n't any other way to get income to support THE FAMILY IN FOSTER CARE .
A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE 's usually what happened .
The other problem with the department at THAT TIME , PEOPLE was that YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME would want to apply for THE AID to have some income and to be able to get MEDICAID so YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME could get prenatal care .
In other states in THE COUNTRY , the welfare departments would pay for THE UNBORN CHILDREN and consider THE APPLICANT qualified for assistance as soon as THE APPLICANT was diagnosed as pregnant .
So THE UNBORN CHILDREN would cover THE UNBORN CHILD and THE UNBORN CHILD would qualify THE UNBORN CHILDREN .
NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES refused to cover THE UNBORN CHILDREN and so WE had young first-time mothers that were trying to get income and be able to get medical care to have a healthy delivery and THE UNBORN CHILDREN could n't get any help .
So WE filed ANOTHER FEDERAL ACTION to try to establish that right to get assistance for THE UNBORN CHILDREN through THE AFDC AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS .
ANOTHER FEDERAL ACTION was again ANOTHER FEDERAL ACTION .
Was that THE TAYLOR V. HILL CASE ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT believe THE TAYLOR V. HILL CASE was TAYLOR .
Both of THE CASES were assigned to JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS and eventually , WE turned both of THE CASES into statewide class actions .
After WE had filed the THE ALEXANDER case , WE were in communication with SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE OTHER TWO LEGAL AID OFFICES and at THAT TIME , PEOPLE , SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE OTHER TWO LEGAL AID OFFICES realized that the counties SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE OTHER TWO LEGAL AID OFFICES were trying to serve had similar problems .
SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE OTHER TWO LEGAL AID OFFICES were not as severe as MECKLENBURG 'S .
In MECKLENBURG 'S , WE had JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS and MECKLENBURG 'S was creating TRULY SEVERE CRISES FOR FAMILIES , whereas in Greensboro and DURHAM , WHICH IS AN UNUSUAL PLACE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT , FAMILIES THAT CAME TO US WITH THAT PROBLEM would n't make THE DECISIONS MADE SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR AT LEAST THE RENT AND THE UTILITIES in THIRTY DAYS OF THE FAMILY 'S APPLYING FOR HELP , but FAMILIES THAT CAME TO US WITH THAT PROBLEM usually did n't take THREE or four months .
JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS would just take maybe two months instead of one ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE .
By doing discovery with SOME OF THOSE OTHER COUNTIES , WE realized that SOME OF THOSE OTHER COUNTIES was more of a statewide problem , so WE asked permission to convert the case for THE INDIVIDUALS in Mecklenburg County to cover a class of similarly - situated THE AID and MEDICAID applicants across A STATE OF DISREPAIR .
Within A YEAR OF FILING IT , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think WE got a temporary order from JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think on August thirteen , 1975 , about a year after WE filed A YEAR OF FILING IT , that authorized WE to proceed as a class and to have A STATE OF DISREPAIR make a plan to come into compliance with the federal processing regulations .
In working with WELFARE RECIPIENTS , to what extent did YOUR find race played a role in the distribution of benefits ? Or did YOUR find that both MANY SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS , BLACK CLIENTS rights were being ignored ?
Well , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that on an individual basis , WELFARE RECIPIENTS could not find in MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS any conscious decision to discriminate on the basis of race .
There was certainly a very great predominance of AFRICAN-AMERICAN recipients in CHARLOTTE .
WELFARE RECIPIENTS very rarely saw white AFDC recipients in CHARLOTTE .
Most of those folks that got help from Social Services that were white lived outside of CHARLOTTE in the mobile home parks and the other parts of MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS or in adjacent counties .
So there was no clear way for WELFARE RECIPIENTS to see discrimination on the ground .
However , in pursuing THE TAYLOR V. HILL CASE , which was the one about the failure of the state to cover THE UNBORN CHILDREN in THE UNBORN CHILDREN THE AID and MEDICAID programs , initially WELFARE RECIPIENTS had won that .
WELFARE RECIPIENTS had gotten A DECISION from JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS and JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS ordered the state to provide AFDC and MEDICAID to YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME with THE UNBORN CHILDREN .
A STATE OF DISREPAIR appealed A DECISION to THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS and while THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS was pending in front of THE FOURTH CIRCUIT 'S , THE SAME ISSUE reached THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT from A CASE THAT HAD STARTED IN IOWA .
And despite the fact that every circuit court that had decided THE SAME ISSUE was in favor of covering THE UNBORN CHILDREN , THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT decided that THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT did not cover THE UNBORN CHILDREN .
Then the FOURTH circuit vacated JUDGE MCMILLAN 'S DECISION based upon the decision of THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT .
WELFARE RECIPIENTS constitutional claim was actually based on the Fourteenth Amendment and at THAT TIME , PEOPLE , WELFARE RECIPIENTS decided to explore whether or not there had been a racial purpose in not opting to cover THE UNBORN CHILDREN .
This other lawyer named Rick Hart , who worked in OUR OFFICE in CHARLOTTE , and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT decided to research the history of the state welfare department records about THE MAIN CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , AND MEDICAID , WHICH WAS THE RELATIVELY NEW MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , TO COVER FAMILIES THAT QUALIFIED FOR AFDC .
WELFARE RECIPIENTS went to RALEIGH and started reading the minutes of the board meetings to see what considerations there had been regarding A STATE OF DISREPAIR decisions to set the benefit levels where THE UNBORN CHILDREN set THE UNBORN CHILDREN and what options to cover or not cover .
Because THE CONGRESS had given enough money to the federal agency , the health and education welfare department , to reimburse STATES THAT DID CHOOSE TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR UNBORN CHILDREN , and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think a majority of STATES THAT DID CHOOSE TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR UNBORN CHILDREN did choose that option .
What was interesting to WELFARE RECIPIENTS is that most of OTHER SOUTHERN STATES did not .
In North Carolina at THAT TIME , PEOPLE , WELFARE RECIPIENTS realized WELFARE RECIPIENTS had THE SECOND HIGHEST INFANT MORTALITY RATE in THE COUNTRY .
WELFARE RECIPIENTS had very poorly developed medical delivery systems in the rural parts of A STATE OF DISREPAIR .
And if there was anything that YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME needed to try to avoid premature births or losing CHILDREN THAT COULD APPLY FOR AFDC , A STATE OF DISREPAIR was medical care , but YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME could n't get A STATE OF DISREPAIR without having this coverage that WELFARE RECIPIENTS were seeking through THE LITIGATION IN THE -LSB- MARGARET -RSB- HARRIS - -LSB- MITCHELL -RSB- KANNON SUIT .
Well , as WELFARE RECIPIENTS started reading through these archives , WELFARE RECIPIENTS found THE MINUTES OF THE STATE .
THE BOARD MEMBERS OF THE STATE WELFARE DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THEY THOUGHT THE STATE HAD WAS NEGRO BIRTHS OUT OF WEDLOCK , IS HOW THEY DETERMINED IT did all kinds of THINGS THAT ARE IN THE NEWSPAPER to try to discourage JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS from having CHILDREN THAT COULD APPLY FOR AFDC .
WELFARE RECIPIENTS also saw references to how some counties in eastern NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES , and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT particularly remember Robeson County systematically cutting off AFDC payments to QUALIFIED MOTHERS during harvesting season to provide a source of cheap labor for the farmers to force YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME to go harvest crops in ITS ATHLETIC FIELD .
WELFARE RECIPIENTS was known to THE STATE WELFARE BOARD and QUALIFIED MOTHERS tolerated THE STATE WELFARE BOARD , because QUALIFIED MOTHERS thought THE STATE WELFARE BOARD was THE STATE WELFARE BOARD .
THE STATE WELFARE BOARD was put in THE MINUTES OF THE STATE .
With HER BACKGROUND PRIOR TO HER COMMUNITY ACTIVISM , WELFARE RECIPIENTS decided WELFARE RECIPIENTS wanted to interview SOME OF THE PEOPLE in THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAD TRIED TO FASHION POLICY and WELFARE RECIPIENTS found this guy that worked at the social work school at CHAPEL HILL , who had been THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT .
WELFARE RECIPIENTS interviewed SOME OF THE PEOPLE and found out that when SOME OF THE PEOPLE and THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT would go to THE STATE LEGISLATURE to try to get THEIR BUDGETS passed that HE AND THE DIRECTOR were commonly asked about the racial statistics of the participants in THE DISABLED PROGRAM , and THE MAIN CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , AND MEDICAID , WHICH WAS THE RELATIVELY NEW MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , TO COVER FAMILIES THAT QUALIFIED FOR AFDC was very heavily black and THE DISABLED PROGRAM .
THE STATE LEGISLATURE had authorized THEIR BUDGETS to pay a much higher per capita benefit to THE DISABLED PROGRAM than the family program .
SOME OF THE PEOPLE was convinced THE STATE LEGISLATURE was because the legislators did n't like the predominately-black AFDC program and favored , just out of pure racial politics , THE DISABLED PROGRAM .
So WELFARE RECIPIENTS decided with A VERY DETAILED WORKING KNOWLEDGE , WELFARE RECIPIENTS thought that THE DECISION OF THE DEPARTMENT TO NOT COVER UNBORN CHILDREN was viewed by THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAD TRIED TO FASHION POLICY as unpopular because it was predominately black families that needed that help .
A VERY DETAILED WORKING KNOWLEDGE was A VERY DETAILED WORKING KNOWLEDGE not to cover THE UNBORN CHILDREN at the constitutional level .
Who was THE PERSON AT CHAPEL HILL YOU SPOKE WITH , DO YOU REMEMBER ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't remember A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT .
THIS would have been MID-70S ?
THIS would have been about 1976 , probably .
So what was the ultimate outcome of the TAYLOR v. HILL and ALEXANDER V. HILL , THE PROCESSING CASE litigation ?
With TAYLOR , we had a new hearing in FRONT OF A THREE-JUDGE COURT IN CHARLOTTE .
JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS was one of the judges .
THE SECOND DISTRICT COURT JUDGE was THE SECOND DISTRICT COURT JUDGE .
Then -LSB- JAMES -RSB- BRAXTON CRAVEN FROM THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS was JAMES -RSB- BRAXTON CRAVEN FROM THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS .
THEY heard all of this evidence that WE put in FRONT OF A THREE-JUDGE COURT IN CHARLOTTE about the historical racial discrimination in THE MAIN CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , AND MEDICAID , WHICH WAS THE RELATIVELY NEW MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM , TO COVER FAMILIES THAT QUALIFIED FOR AFDC in NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES and WE argued that THE CURRENT POLICY THAT WE WERE ATTACKING was THE CURRENT POLICY THAT WE WERE ATTACKING and that THEY could infer NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES and should infer that because there was no rational justification for THE CURRENT POLICY THAT WE WERE ATTACKING .
THEY never gave any sensible explanation .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had done a deposition of THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT and asked THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT .
THE ANSWER was THE ANSWER . ''
THE ANSWER was THE ANSWER to that question .
WE argued to AN IRRATIONAL BASIS FOR MAKING A POLICY DECISION THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 'S LIVES IN THE STATE that AN IRRATIONAL BASIS FOR MAKING A POLICY DECISION THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 'S LIVES IN THE STATE was AN IRRATIONAL BASIS FOR MAKING A POLICY DECISION THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 'S LIVES IN THE STATE .
Unfortunately , THE TWO JUDGES other than JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS voted to deny WE claim and JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS dissented with A VERY STRONG OPINION .
WE appealed A DECISION to THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT and THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT chose not to hear AN APPEAL , as THE TWO JUDGES have THE TWO JUDGES power to decide which cases THE TWO JUDGES will consider important enough to hear .
THE TWO JUDGES accept about one of a hundred and WE was one of the ninety-nine THE TWO JUDGES chose not to hear .
By 1977 , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that A CASE THAT HAD STARTED IN IOWA had been declined for review by THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT .
TWO more years later , WE lobbyist in THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY , WHO WAS LESLIE WINNER , WHO 'S NOW THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR UNC , I THINK BY IT was probably 1981 , she was able to convince a couple of key legislators that it was irrational and damaging to not cover THE UNBORN CHILDREN .
So through legislative action , WE got the state to opt in to cover THE UNBORN CHILDREN .
As for ALEXANDER V. HILL , THE PROCESSING CASE , the state departments at THE COUNTY LEVEL basically just seemed to not want to have enough competent staff to make THE DECISIONS MADE SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR AT LEAST THE RENT AND THE UTILITIES in a timely manner .
So similar to what happened in THE -LSB- MARGARET -RSB- HARRIS and KANNON v. HUD , about every two years , WE would keep monitoring KANNON V. HUD progress and find that KANNON V. HUD were not complying .
WE filed A MOTION for contempt of court in front of JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS and MCMILLAN decided that after THREE YEARS OF NOT COMING INTO COMPLIANCE , and in SOME COUNTIES , like MECKLENBURG 'S particularly was doing worse than better in many instances , MCMILLAN got mad enough to enter A NEW ORDER THAT SAID FOR EVERY SINGLE APPLICATION THAT WAS PENDING OVER THE DEADLINE WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE that was documented in the file , MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS would have to pay A FINE to the applicant in THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY DOLLARS PER WEEK for every week THEIR APPLICATION was overdue without good cause .
A STATE OF DISREPAIR appealed A DECISION THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS and that appeal was heard in DURHAM , WHICH IS AN UNUSUAL PLACE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT .
A STATE OF DISREPAIR usually does n't sit in any place other than Richmond , but KANNON V. HUD had a panel in DURHAM , WHICH IS AN UNUSUAL PLACE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT .
KANNON V. HUD heard A STATE OF DISREPAIR arguments there and completely dismissed KANNON V. HUD and upheld Judge McMillan THREE to zero .
A STATE OF DISREPAIR then petitioned THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT to review A DECISION and WE wrote a brief in opposition to that petition .
The Supremes declined to review THE FOURTH CIRCUIT 'S decision that upheld JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think A DECISION was made in 1979 .
So WE had a permanent injunction that required all the decisions to be made within the federal time guide .
By THEN , the federal rule had been amended from THIRTY DAYS OF THE FAMILY 'S APPLYING FOR HELP to FORTY-FIVE DAYS , so THEN had FIFTEEN more days to make A DECISION than when WE started in 1974 , THAT TENANT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN NO MONEY and MOST OF THE COUNTIES still were not doing MOST OF THE COUNTIES .
Then WE would have a series of other motions in FRONT OF A THREE-JUDGE COURT IN CHARLOTTE .
There were so many creative ways that A STATE OF DISREPAIR and SOME OF THE COUNTIES figured to subvert SOME OF THE COUNTIES obligation .
In many counties , SOME OF THE COUNTIES just started denying every application that had not been approved on THE FORTY-FOURTH DAY so SOME OF THE COUNTIES would show no cases that were pending over FORTY-FIVE DAYS .
And WE would go into SOME COUNTIES and WE would go through file drawers to see what had happened in those files and WE would see HUNDREDS OF FILES where HUNDREDS OF FILES did n't make A DECISION based upon anybody 's being ineligible because HUNDREDS OF FILES had TOO MUCH MONEY or HUNDREDS OF FILES were n't cooperating by providing information necessary to finish THEIR APPLICATION .
HUNDREDS OF FILES would just deny every application that was still pending on THE FORTY-FOURTH DAY that HUNDREDS OF FILES could n't otherwise approve , that HUNDREDS OF FILES had n't approved for SOME REASON .
When HUNDREDS OF FILES were just overworked or had n't gotten to THE FORTY-FOURTH DAY , HUNDREDS OF FILES would just start denying JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS .
So WE had to go back in and get supplemental orders to prohibit HUNDREDS OF FILES denying people arbitrarily to avoid having the deadline come and being overdue and having to pay the fines .
This went on for TWENTY-FIVE YEARS .
After about THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT could n't stand THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS anymore .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT got out of THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS shortly after THE FOURTH CIRCUIT 'S DECISION THAT UPHELD JUDGE MCMILLAN .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was pretty much totally into HOUSING WORK and doing HOUSING WORK with these neighborhood organizations and things like HOUSING WORK , and doing legislative work .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT could not do the day-to-day guerrilla warfare , but TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do remember this one thing .
There was ONE county in the state that finally got ONE act together and consistently accepted JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS on the same day that JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS came to apply , which was ANOTHER PART OF THE ORDER .
JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS would process all the applications within the forty-five-day time limit .
JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS wanted to be exempt from THE FIFTY-DOLLAR PER WEEK FINES , because THE FIFTY-DOLLAR PER WEEK FINES just said , `` Well , WE 're the only county that 's doing well . ''
EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY was EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY .
So the attorney general made A MOTION before THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT to EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY from the class action that covered all a hundred counties for the purposes of A FINE .
WE had sort of A LUKEWARM OPPOSITION to A LUKEWARM OPPOSITION .
WE thought , YOUR know , if EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY was really doing what EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY needed , EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY would never be fined and so there was no point in exempting THEM , so WE sort of made kind of an offer to EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY .
WE composed A SONG , `` THE BALLAD OF DAVIE COUNTY , '' and WE offered to record EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY and have EXEMPT DAVIE COUNTY .
In THE PRINTED OPINION , JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS recited `` A SONG , `` THE BALLAD OF DAVIE COUNTY '' that WE had offered and printed A VERY STRONG OPINION in THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT opinion , but granted A STATE OF DISREPAIR motion and let THEM out .
So WE were able to get A VERY DIFFICULT TIME in this otherwise terrible , seemingly endless struggle .
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME was A VERY DIFFICULT TIME .
YOUR do n't remember any of the lyrics of A SONG , `` THE BALLAD OF DAVIE COUNTY , do YOUR ?
Sure TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do .
Do YOUR care to put THOSE PROPERTIES down for history ?
Well , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 'll be glad to .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 've got THE PRINTED OPINION .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 'll be glad to give THE PRINTED OPINION to YOUR if YOUR want to add that to THE TRANSCRIPT -LSB- see copy enclosed with THE TRANSCRIPT .
Sure , yeah , that 'd be great .
YOUR 're , of course , describing considerable hostility to the notion of WELFARE RIGHTS ACROSS THE TIME YOUR 're working with THE SAME ISSUE .
Thinking broadly about the years YOUR worked with THE SAME ISSUE and beyond , how would YOUR describe THE LEVEL OF POPULAR AND POLITICAL SUPPORT for the idea of WELFARE RIGHTS ACROSS THE TIME and any changes in THE LEVEL OF POPULAR AND POLITICAL SUPPORT ?
Well , within NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES , there was just virtually never any visible support for welfare recipients in any way that TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT ever saw .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT mean , welfare was just generally unpopular and POOR PEOPLE were generally unpopular .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT never quite realized THE LEVEL OF THAT HOSTILITY until TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT became an amateur lobbyist and went to THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY , WHO WAS LESLIE WINNER , WHO 'S NOW THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR UNC , I THINK BY IT to try to change all of those common law rules and NEGATIVE RULES ABOUT TENANTS that TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was describing for YOUR .
Tell SARAH THUESEN a little bit about that experience lobbying on behalf of THE LOW-INCOME TENANTS .
Well , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT still remember TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT FIRST meeting with a very progressive Democratic representative in MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS and was a political science professor out at UNC-CHARLOTTE .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT told SARAH THUESEN about NEGATIVE RULES ABOUT TENANTS , about the common law rule that entitled TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY to THE REPAIRS and THE QUICK PROCEDURE for evicting people and how impossible THE QUICK PROCEDURE was to ever have A NEW TRIAL and get A NEW TRIAL in FRONT OF A JURY OR A REAL JUDGE and so forth .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT told SARAH THUESEN we wanted to try to get a bill that would give some minimum protections for THE TENANTS ' rights and SARAH THUESEN said , `` THE TENANTS ' wo n't vote for THE TENANTS ' . ''
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT said , `` What do YOUR mean ? '' SARAH THUESEN says , `` MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY are THE LANDLORDS ' and THE PEOPLE IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 're not going to tell YOUR why THE PEOPLE IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 're going to vote against MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY , but SOME REASON 's SOME REASON .
YOUR have NO CHANCE .
YOUR should n't even bother . ''
NO CHANCE was 1975 .
Who was that ?
NO CHANCE was LOUISE BRENNAN , THAT SAME LEGISLATOR I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT .
Well , given how bad THINGS THAT ARE IN THE NEWSPAPER were in THE COURTS and WE had tried THREE different times to get FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS to change THE CAVEAT EMPTOR RULE , THE CAVEAT EMPTOR RULE is amend THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND and adopt the modern day doctrine of the implied covenant of habitability or THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY , but NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES rejected NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES THREE times .
After THE THIRD TIME , one of the judges said , `` And by THE STATE WELFARE BOARD , A MATTER FOR THE LEGISLATURE is A MATTER FOR THE LEGISLATURE . ''
So finally WE decided even though it might be difficult to deal with THE STATE LEGISLATURE , WE were n't getting anywhere with THE COURTS .
So , in 1975 , WE tried to get A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS .
WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH .
WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH .
WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH had been WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH .
WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was very popular and the very idea that WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was willing to carry this flag terrified THE LANDLORDS ' lobby for THE REALTORS ' Association .
What do YOUR think inspired WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH to take up SUCH AN UNPOPULAR ISSUE ?
WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was just WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH and NEGATIVE RULES ABOUT TENANTS were so grossly unfair that TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think SUCH AN UNPOPULAR ISSUE just-he found SUCH AN UNPOPULAR ISSUE unconscionable that TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY could be required to pay RENT AND UTILITIES and have completely unsafe and unhealthy dwellings and not be able to do anything about RENT AND UTILITIES , and the ONE ATTEMPT people could make to do something about ONE ATTEMPT , through THE CITY INSPECTORS , could be completely undercut by RETALIATORY EVICTIONS , WHICH CREATED SUCH A CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT MOST OF THE TENANTS WOULD N'T LET THE INSPECTORS INTO THEIR HOUSES .
So WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was willing to try NEGATIVE RULES ABOUT TENANTS and WE came very close in 1975 .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think WE got 1975 passed on the FIRST reading and then 1975 was defeated in the SECOND reading , but 1975 was very close .
THE FOLLOWING YEAR , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT came back again and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT decided TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was going to just work full-time on THE FOLLOWING YEAR for the whole session , if THE FOLLOWING YEAR took FOUR MONTHS .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT just moved to RALEIGH and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT worked on RALEIGH for four days A WEEK .
WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH had dropped out of THE STATE LEGISLATURE and THE THIRD TIME WE convinced HENRY FRYE 'S to be HENRY FRYE 'S .
Now WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was ONE OF ONLY THREE AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE HOUSE out of a hundred and twenty , but the good thing about HENRY FRYE 'S was that HENRY FRYE 'S was smart and WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was kind and WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH was fairly well-respected and WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH had been appointed chairman of THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE by Carl Stewart , the Speaker of THE HOUSE .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH realized that ONE OF ONLY THREE AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE HOUSE was very difficult .
WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH knew that two-thirds of the people in THE STATE LEGISLATURE were probably THE LANDLORDS ' , but WADE SMITH , A LAWYER FROM RALEIGH realized that THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES IN THE STATE was probably THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES IN THE STATE that AFRICAN-AMERICAN could deal with .
At THAT TIME , PEOPLE , there were TWO other really , really hot issues going on in THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY , WHO WAS LESLIE WINNER , WHO 'S NOW THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR UNC , I THINK BY IT .
THE ERA -LSB- EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT was THE ERA -LSB- EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT -RSB- and JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were extremely excited about EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT .
All YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME groups were working hard for THE ERA -LSB- EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT and many of those groups wanted to get THE LANDLORD-TENANT BILL passed , because most of THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET were female .
So we would end up getting a lot of support from the political caucuses at THE COUNTY LEVEL .
YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME were already sort of activated around THE ERA -LSB- EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT .
THE OTHER INTERESTING THING THAT WAS GOING ON was THE OTHER INTERESTING THING THAT WAS GOING ON .
Prior to 1977 , there had been no right for any restaurants or any retail establishments to sell alcohol .
THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD GET ALCOHOL was to bring THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD GET ALCOHOL to the restaurant and SOME OF THEM would mix YOUR a drink .
YOUR could bring YOUR own alcohol , but SOME OF THEM would n't sell YOUR a drink for a bar , because there were n't any allowed in A STATE OF DISREPAIR .
The chambers of commerce were very actively supporting THE OTHER INTERESTING THING THAT WAS GOING ON , and THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION was supporting THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION .
HENRY FRYE 'S and the TWO other black legislators finally realized that HENRY FRYE AND THE TWO OTHER BLACK LEGISLATORS and some of HENRY FRYE AND THE TWO OTHER BLACK LEGISLATORS allies could make the difference on whether or not liquor-by-the-drink would pass , because HENRY FRYE AND THE TWO OTHER BLACK LEGISLATORS 'd have to have about ten or twelve urban votes to pass liquor-by-the-drink .
Because THE RURAL LEGISLATORS were generally very much opposed to TWO and THE RURAL LEGISLATORS were also opposed to THE LANDLORD-TENANT BILL .
So the margin of difference for getting the landlord-tenant bill and liquor-by-the-drink was all in the metropolitan areas .
So TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think HENRY FRYE 'S and THE KEY TO GETTING THE BILL PASSED THAT CREATED THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1977 finally figured out that HENRY AND SOME OF HIS ALLIES could find a way to support both if JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS would agree to support both .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think THE KEY TO GETTING THE BILL PASSED THAT CREATED THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1977 was THE KEY TO GETTING THE BILL PASSED THAT CREATED THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1977 .
We got THE KEY TO GETTING THE BILL PASSED THAT CREATED THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1977 passed on THE SENATE SIDE by another just incredible quirk of THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES .
JIMMY GREEN was JIMMY GREEN and JIMMY GREEN hated THE TENANTS THAT WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET rights bills .
JIMMY GREEN had been the one that stopped THE KEY TO GETTING THE BILL PASSED THAT CREATED THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1977 in the THE HOUSE side in 1975 and now JIMMY GREEN was JIMMY GREEN and JIMMY GREEN had HENRY FRYE 'S bill bottled up in A COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE SIDE .
But TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT found a lobbyist for the AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED PERSONS -LSB- AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED PERSONS -RSB- , who was this little old , retired professor from Wake Forest who was seventy-eight years old .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT explained to HER how important THE OTHER INTERESTING THING THAT WAS GOING ON was for ELDERLY PEOPLE .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had all of the census data from 1970 and a vast majority of ELDERLY PEOPLE lived in very low-income substandard housing in A STATE OF DISREPAIR and none of ELDERLY PEOPLE had any protection .
HER went in and saw JIMMY GREEN by HER and in fifteen minutes , HER came out and said , `` JIMMY GREEN 's going to get A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS out . ''
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT said , `` How in the world is JIMMY GREEN going to get A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS out ? '' HER says , `` Well , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had to explain to JIMMY GREEN that if JIMMY GREEN did n't get A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS out , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was going to have to go on TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT TV program this Sunday and explain how JIMMY GREEN did n't care about the housing for any the elderly people in A STATE OF DISREPAIR . ''
A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS came out of A COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE SIDE the next day and A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS passed .
A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS was truly amazing .
A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS was some skillful maneuvering on HER part .
A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS was brilliant on HER part .
Do YOUR remember HER name ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think A DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF SOME SORT was Dr. ELIZABETH WELCH , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think was ELIZABETH WELCH name .
Was JIMMY GREEN A LANDLORD ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think so , yeah .
Tobacco warehouses was JIMMY GREEN main business , but TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think JIMMY GREEN was A LANDLORD too .
So THAT PASSED IN 1979 .
Then in 1977 , we came back and got a new bill to outlaw RETALIATORY EVICTIONS , WHICH CREATED SUCH A CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT MOST OF THE TENANTS WOULD N'T LET THE INSPECTORS INTO THEIR HOUSES and THE CHARLOTTE CITY COUNCIL again was THE CHARLOTTE CITY COUNCIL , because PEOPLE LIKE HARVEY GANTT AND BETTY CHAFIN knew that PEOPLE LIKE HARVEY GANTT AND BETTY CHAFIN housing inspection program was completely thwarted by the imminent threat of RETALIATORY EVICTIONS , WHICH CREATED SUCH A CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT MOST OF THE TENANTS WOULD N'T LET THE INSPECTORS INTO THEIR HOUSES .
So PEOPLE LIKE HARVEY GANTT AND BETTY CHAFIN convinced PARKS HELMS , who was one of the legislators from MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS , to sponsor THE RETALIATORY EVICTION DEFENSE BILL IN 1979 .
PARKS HELMS did A MASTERFUL JOB getting that passed .
What that did is A MASTERFUL JOB disallowed RETALIATORY EVICTIONS , WHICH CREATED SUCH A CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT MOST OF THE TENANTS WOULD N'T LET THE INSPECTORS INTO THEIR HOUSES in response to tenants asking THE LANDLORDS ' for REPAIRS , TENANTS HAVING INSPECTIONS DONE BY THE CITY OR HEALTH DEPARTMENT , THE CITY DOING AN INSPECTION ON ITS OWN , TENANTS ATTEMPTING TO ORGANIZE THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS , OR TENANTS EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE STATE STATUTE OR FEDERAL LAW .
All FIVE of those activities were protected from retaliatory eviction in THE RETALIATORY EVICTION DEFENSE BILL IN 1979 .
FIVE was one of the most far-reaching retaliatory eviction bills in THE COUNTRY .
FIVE was just wonderful .
That same year , LOUISE BRENNAN , THAT SAME LEGISLATOR I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT , was on HENRY FRYE 'S committee .
NO , this was 1977 .
LOUISE BRENNAN , THAT SAME LEGISLATOR I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT was on HENRY FRYE 'S judiciary committee and we had gotten JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS to declare THE CAVEAT EMPTOR RULE about all the procedural rules that kept TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY from doing APPEALS were unconstitutional : THE THIRD RULE , THE THIRD RULE .
Those THREE rules together were declared unconstitutional by Judge McMillan in 1976 in Usher v. Waters Insurance and Realty Company , which is on that list TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT gave YOUR .
Then THE LANDLORDS ' Association came back the next year in THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY , WHO WAS LESLIE WINNER , WHO 'S NOW THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR UNC , I THINK BY IT and tried to undo A DECISION by sponsoring a bill that would give THE MAGISTRATES complete discretion to set any amount of bond THE MAGISTRATES wanted .
So THE LANDLORDS ' ASSOCIATION could be MORE THAN THREE MONTHS ' rent if THE LANDLORDS ' wanted .
THE LANDLORDS ' ASSOCIATION was assigned to HENRY FRYE 'S committee and LOUISE BRENNAN , THAT SAME LEGISLATOR I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT created a subcommittee and basically invited TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT to rewrite A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY AND OUTLAW RETALIATORY EVICTIONS .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT sat down with THE REALTORS ' Association and WE worked out a whole new bill that enabled TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY to stay in possession by paying THEIR NEXT WEEK 'S RENT IN ADVANCE , OR PERHAPS ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE in advance one at A TIME , or if THE REALTORS ' ASSOCIATION 's THE REALTORS ' ASSOCIATION .
THE REALTORS ' ASSOCIATION became THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND .
So by 1979 , all of those fundamental problems for tenants that WE had faced in 1974 , THAT TENANT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN NO MONEY had been completely changed as a combination of JUDGE MCMILLAN 'S DECISION and THREE successful legislative bills .
How did THE PASSAGE OF THAT LEGISLATION affect the type of CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE ?
Well , THE PASSAGE OF THAT LEGISLATION mainly meant that CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE had SO MANY NEW RIGHTS to protect JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS that it became somewhat known in THE CHERRY COMMUNITY that CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE could actually do something .
Instead of just telling people JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were out of luck and that JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were going to lose and how quickly JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were going to lose and how badly JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were going to lose , CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE suddenly had all kinds of SO MANY NEW RIGHTS .
CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE had the ability to stop RETALIATORY EVICTIONS , WHICH CREATED SUCH A CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT MOST OF THE TENANTS WOULD N'T LET THE INSPECTORS INTO THEIR HOUSES , CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE had counter-claims to offset unpaid rent when JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS had lived in substandard conditions for long periods of THE TIME THIS WAS GOING ON , and CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE were winning THE PROCESSING CASE , at least in THE DISTRICT COURT .
SOME SUCCESS WITH THAT EFFORT started to become known by people in the social services community , so CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE got more clients referred to CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE , because CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE had something useful to provide .
Part of what CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE did eventually was develop pro se pleading forms that JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS could take and fill out JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS and go to court on ITS OWN .
CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE developed videos , which simulated trials , so JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS could watch that and learn how to present JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS own case .
CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE 've had plenty of TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY , won judgments against THE LANDLORD .
Then sort of the next level of what CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE did was start training volunteer lawyers to help TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY exercise SO MANY NEW RIGHTS , too .
So CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE 've had A WHOLE SERIES OF CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT WE OFFER FOR PRIVATE LAWYERS TO LEARN ABOUT TENANTS ' RIGHTS AND REMEDIES .
Now CLIENTS YOU SAW ON A DAILY BASIS HERE AT THE LEGAL AID OFFICE have a pretty good set of VOLUNTEER LAWYERS THAT HELP PEOPLE .
MORE THAN THREE MONTHS ' ago , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT gave a case to this lawyer who was a first-year lawyer , THE FIRST TRIAL SHE HAD EVER HAD is THE FIRST TRIAL SHE HAD EVER HAD .
In A CASE THAT HAD STARTED IN IOWA , SHE stopped the eviction , SHE won a counter-claim based on THIS IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY , and an unfair trade practice , which trebled the amount of the claim .
SHE won A FIFTY-FIVE-THOUSAND-DOLLAR CLAIM FOR HER TENANT AND THE JUDGE awarded THE TENANT TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK OR SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK attorney 's fees of thirteen thousand dollars on top of the award for THIS PARTICULAR CLIENT .
A FIFTY-FIVE-THOUSAND-DOLLAR CLAIM FOR HER TENANT AND THE JUDGE was a very happy first-year lawyer .
SHE had a real strong sense of accomplishment and success .
Unfortunately , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think SHE career peaked in SHE first year , but still HER FIRST YEAR 's HER FIRST YEAR .
A PRETTY STRONG CASE was A PRETTY STRONG CASE ; there were some imminently dangerous conditions in THE HOUSE .
But if that same case had come to OUR in 1974 , THAT TENANT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN NO MONEY , probably would have been out on the street in three weeks .
Were there new issues that YOUR started dealing with more in THE 1980S that YOUR had not dealt with in THE LATE 1970S , even as YOUR continued THE TENANTS ' rights work ?
Well , there were different things that came up at THREE DIFFERENT TIMES .
A lot of what happened in THE 1980S was trying to expand some of the victories that OUR had achieved in litigation or in a legislative way to other parts of A STATE OF DISREPAIR .
When OUR had these new laws for TENANTS WHO COULD BE EVICTED SO SWIFTLY AND SO SEVERELY , in MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS , MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS only took OUR maybe TWO to THREE YEARS OF NOT COMING INTO COMPLIANCE to educate THE MAGISTRATES and THE TWO JUDGES to be able to get THE MAGISTRATES to actually follow the new law .
While OUR was happening here , nothing was happening in Gaston County TWENTY-FIVE miles away and nothing was happening in Cabarrus County .
Down in THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE , THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE was even more primitive than the counties contiguous to MECKLENBURG 'S .
So a great deal of what OUR did in THE 1980S and in the 1990s , frankly , was hiring and training VOLUNTEER LAWYERS THAT HELP PEOPLE to cover these other parts of A STATE OF DISREPAIR of the THREE main metropolitan areas , and trying to get VOLUNTEER LAWYERS THAT HELP PEOPLE to be able to educate THE TWO JUDGES and get OUR CLIENTS to try to stand up for THE TWO JUDGES rights .
THIS was not just in housing and in welfare .
THIS was also in the context of employment .
The changes in THE CONSUMER LAW were equally as dramatic as in housing and welfare .
In 1974 , THAT TENANT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN NO MONEY , THE CONSUMER LAW was completely oriented towards THE CREDITORS .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT still recall that FURNITURE COMPANIES would create security agreements that would take A SECURITY INTEREST in every single thing in A CONSUMER 'S house .
So FURNITURE COMPANIES would go to the furniture company and FURNITURE COMPANIES would try to buy A COUCH and A COUCH would cost five hundred dollars , or a dining room set .
THE SECURITY INTEREST AS COLLATERAL FOR THE PURCHASE IN THAT LOAN would say that FURNITURE COMPANIES were giving A SECURITY INTEREST in the dishes , the other furniture , the TV , the pictures in FURNITURE COMPANIES house , and FURNITURE COMPANIES would waive FURNITURE COMPANIES right to FURNITURE COMPANIES constitutional exemption from JUDGMENTS THAT WOULD TAKE ALL OF THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSIONS .
Whether THE SECURITY INTEREST AS COLLATERAL FOR THE PURCHASE IN THAT LOAN was lawful or not was tested in the North Carolina Supreme Court in a case that two of our lawyers handled .
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT said that THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT was okay for the consumer to waive HER constitutional right to keep a minimum amount of her own personal property in one of these security agreements , and that security agreement enabled that creditor to take HER picture of PRESIDENT KENNEDY , MARTIN LUTHER KING , AND ROBERT KENNEDY , and PRESIDENT KENNEDY , MARTIN LUTHER KING , AND ROBERT KENNEDY took THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT out of HER house to sell to satisfy PRESIDENT KENNEDY , MARTIN LUTHER KING , AND ROBERT KENNEDY claim .
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT was that extreme .
THE MID-70S was THE MID-70S ?
THE MID-70S was in the middle 70s .
OUR response to THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT was to send TWO cracker-jack legal services lawyers to RALEIGH to create new legislation for THEIR EXEMPTIONS .
OUR RESPONSE TO THAT SUPREME COURT created the FIRST statute that defined how JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS could make claims for THEIR EXEMPTIONS and JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS would have twenty days to make a claim for exempting JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS basic household goods and a certain amount of other personal property from execution of JUDGMENTS THAT WOULD TAKE ALL OF THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSIONS .
Until THAT TIME , PEOPLE , again THAT TIME , PEOPLE was similar to THE LANDLORD-TENANT LAW , JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS could be JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS .
So TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think OUR got that , that legislation was passed in 1979 also , to protect THE CREDITORS from total , total wipeout through judgments in security interests .
YOUR 're describing a lot of victories that YOUR had in the mid - to late 70s .
Then in the late 80s , YOUR became involved in more housing advocacy work .
YOUR were ONE OF THE FOUNDING BOARD MEMBERS , am TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT ?
ONE OF THE FOUNDING BOARD MEMBERS 's right , yeah .
What led YOUR to become involved in THIS DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION THAT CAME UP WITH SOME FOUNDATION MONEY IN THE 1980S AFTER THAT and how did YOUR see at ONE POINT the various housing needs of Charlotte changing ?
Well , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think THE REASON I BECAME INVOLVED IN IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO BE THE POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE VEHICLE TO DO MORE HOUSING WORK THAN THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE COULD BE .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT need to explain THE REASON I BECAME INVOLVED IN IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO BE THE POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE VEHICLE TO DO MORE HOUSING WORK THAN THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE COULD BE .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE was just THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE , for lack of a better description .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE had a huge inventory of housing that was beginning to deteriorate .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE had leadership that was not very skillful and was not able to get any good support from THE CITY COUNCIL , WHICH WAS NOT MADE IN PUBLIC .
Political support for low-income housing in THE CONGRESS was beginning to wane .
THE BUDGET FOR HUD -LSB- DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT -RSB- TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING OPERATION OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING was beginning to decline .
THE BUDGET FOR HUD -LSB- DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT -RSB- TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING OPERATION OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING did n't matter which administration was there .
HUD was pretty much the whipping boy of every administration .
HUD was getting the worst treatment in all the budget fights and what that meant on THE LOCAL LEVEL is that as THE OLDER PUBLIC HOUSING INVENTORY began to deteriorate , nobody wanted to do anything about THE OLDER PUBLIC HOUSING INVENTORY .
The people on THE CITY COUNCIL , WHICH WAS NOT MADE IN PUBLIC were not willing to try to put A LOT OF LOCAL MONEY into public housing and so TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think A DECISION was made politically , and TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't know exactly how A DECISION was , but to create A NEW VEHICLE THAT WOULD HAVE SOME BUSINESS COMPONENTS IN IT AND SOME OTHER LEADERSHIP COMPONENT , and SOME OTHER LEADERSHIP COMPONENT would try to leverage private money to put into housing that would not have to be totally subsidized , either by the federal government or local governments .
So TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT helped BETTY CHAFIN , WHO WAS THE KEY PERSON TRYING TO DESIGN THIS NEW VEHICLE , along with the person who was THE ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER AT THAT TIME and later became THE ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER AT THAT TIME , Pam Syfert .
BETTY CHAFIN , WHO WAS THE KEY PERSON TRYING TO DESIGN THIS NEW VEHICLE was the other key player in THE DESIGN OF THE HOUSING PARTNERSHIP .
THE POLITICAL THEORY BEHIND IT was get SOME HIGH-LEVEL EXECUTIVES from the banks , from Duke Power , from Piedmont Natural Gas , and a couple of ministers , and YOUR 'll have kind of a political Noah 's Ark and SOME HIGH-LEVEL EXECUTIVES will have THE CREDIBILITY TO BORROW MONEY , DO PARTNERSHIPS WITH PRIVATE DEVELOPERS , AND DRAW DOWN WHATEVER KINDS OF FEDERAL MONEY WAS AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME .
Well , about the only federal money that was available after WE got operating was the federal low-income housing tax credit deals that were administered through THE STATE DEPARTMENT .
But MY THOUGHT was if WE had a vehicle for new housing that would be aimed mostly at first-time home buyers and then to SOME EXTENT , working-class tenants , that that still was very helpful , because SOME EXTENT was still filling a niche in THE MARKET THAT EXISTED , MY THOUGHT was pretty much vacant between the subsidized housing at THE VERY BOTTOM and the market rate middle-class rental housing was still completely out of reach for most very THE LOW-INCOME TENANTS .
PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING THE MINIMUM WAGE , were living on disability , could n't pay market-rate rent at THAT TIME , PEOPLE , because MARKET-RATE RENTS were MARKET-RATE RENTS for a three-bedroom apartment .
Most people that were WE clients had ability to pay at about two hundred and fifty dollars , and so there was this gap of two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars between what THE MARKET THAT EXISTED provided for decent housing and the ability of even the working-class lowest tenants could pay .
So WE theory was create a vehicle that can somewhat provide some housing in that gap using a variety of resources , and because THIS was politically acceptable for THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED , THIS were willing to put two million dollars a year into the budget that would then be used to leverage loans or try to match other capital , like from THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS .
Then the other aspect of this was THE POLITICAL THEORY BEHIND IT could become the development arm for attacking deteriorated neighborhoods that THE HOUSING AUTHORITY would n't be able to do , would n't have THE CREDIBILITY TO BORROW MONEY , DO PARTNERSHIPS WITH PRIVATE DEVELOPERS , AND DRAW DOWN WHATEVER KINDS OF FEDERAL MONEY WAS AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME .
So ONE OF THE FIRST PROJECTS WE TOOK ON was BIDDLEVILLE adjacent to THE FAIRVIEW HOMES public housing development , THE CATALYST FOR AN ATTEMPT BY AN INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER NAMED LOUISE SELLERS , WHO REACTED TO THAT BY DECIDING TO DO HER OWN DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE AND STARTED HAVING MEETINGS OF RESIDENTS IN CHURCHES .
ONE OF THE FIRST PROJECTS WE TOOK ON was located between Interstate 77 and THE FAIRVIEW HOMES .
ONE OF THE FIRST PROJECTS WE TOOK ON was ONE OF THE FIRST PROJECTS WE TOOK ON .
Is THIS GENESIS PARK ?
THIS became GENESIS PARK .
What WE did there essentially was go in and buy up the entire neighborhood and convert fourplexes or duplexes into single-family homes that would have FOUR bedrooms and TWO bathrooms , instead of having TWO two-bedroom apartments next to each other .
WE tore down the worst properties and evicted the drug dealers and essentially remade A HUGE BARGAIN .
A HUGE BARGAIN was A HUGE BARGAIN .
Of course , A HUGE BARGAIN had to be a huge bargain to attract JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS .
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT REALLY WERE WILLING TO DO THAT were THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT REALLY WERE WILLING TO DO THAT .
Once YOUR had a few pioneers that would do THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT REALLY WERE WILLING TO DO THAT and THE CITY ASSIGNED COMMUNITY POLICING TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD , THE CITY ASSIGNED COMMUNITY POLICING TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD was THE CITY ASSIGNED COMMUNITY POLICING TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD , made THE CITY ASSIGNED COMMUNITY POLICING TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD a successful project .
THE -LSB- CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG HOUSING -RSB- PARTNERSHIP was founded in ' 88 , ' 89 ?
Yeah , THE -LSB- CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG HOUSING -RSB- PARTNERSHIP started in 1988 , but TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't think WE hired Pat Garrett until 1989 .
She was the FIRST director and the only director WE 've had .
And THE GENESIS PARK PROJECT was in THE MID-90S that THE MID-90S was going on , is that correct ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think THE GENESIS PARK PROJECT started in the early 90s .
THE GENESIS PARK PROJECT was one of the FIRST things .
The other neighborhood THE MID-90S did was ironically , the old Greenville urban renewal neighborhood that had been pretty much left dormant .
SOME OF THAT LAND was vacant for TWENTY YEARS after the urban renewal occurred , but THE MID-90S were able to get SOME PROPERTY THAT WAS ADJACENT TO ITS ATHLETIC FIELD from the city for free and just built new houses with BANK OF AMERICA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION , was the partner with BANK OF AMERICA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION .
SOME OF THAT LAND built beautiful houses , eighteen hundred square feet , for high forties or low fifties , a good bargain , HALF A MILE from downtown .
In 1999 , when the Charlotte Observer did SOME OF THAT LAND series on the housing situation in THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED , YOUR at THAT TIME , PEOPLE warned that CHARLOTTE was becoming a `` tale of TWO cities . ''
What did YOUR mean by 1999 ?
Well , CHARLOTTE had become one of these so-called Sun Belt success cities in THE SENSE OF SECURITY of suburban development , not totally suburban , but also in sort of a renaissance of the inner city too , with some of the high-end developments that were coming into near downtown or in downtown in Fourth Ward and in Third Ward , the reinvestment in Dilworth .
YOUR had great expansion of the THREE major banks and very successful attraction of other business .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that CHARLOTTE was perceived sort of on a national scale as being a very attractive place for wealthy people .
The growth pattern was to have mostly very wealthy people coming to THE CITY , WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THEM ASSUMED and as new neighborhoods developed in the suburbs and became annexed into the city limits , it was mostly very affluent people that were coming here .
But at THE SAME TIME , THAT CREATED THE SENSE OF SECURITY THAT I THINK , ALONG WITH THE BARGAIN VALUE , the wage level for the unskilled laborers remained static .
NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES had not increased NORTH CAROLINA THAT HAD LEGAL AID OFFICES minimum wage in , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't know , FIFTEEN or twenty years .
The AFDC levels were still very low , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think to try to encourage JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS to work .
And THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT had quit building any new public housing .
There was no new public housing at all , period .
So what was going on was that we had a strata of JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS at THE VERY BOTTOM , who were THE DISABLED PEOPLE or the people that were making THE MINIMUM WAGE , WHO REALLY COULD NOT AFFORD TO LIVE HERE , but JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS were still here .
What has happened is that a lot of JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS now are the hidden homeless people .
What JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS have done , since JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS ca n't afford to rent JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS own house for six hundred dollars a month , is JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS join households .
Sometimes YOUR have one or TWO and even three families living in the same houses .
YOUR do n't have THE FAMILIES .
Instead , THE FAMILIES do n't live on THE STREET , THE FAMILIES live in OTHER PEOPLE 'S HOUSES UNKNOWN TO THE HOST FAMILY 'S LANDLORD , WHICH CREATES A PRECARIOUS SITUATION .
YOUR mentioned the declining number of public housing units , or the federal government not building new units .
YOUR 've worked with some folks who used to live in PIEDMONT COURTS , is that right , or the BELMONT neighborhood , or maybe both ?
Well , PIEDMONT COURTS is in BELMONT .
PIEDMONT COURTS 's ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS that , ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS is one of the TWO original public housing developments .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think PIEDMONT COURTS was built about 1938 .
PIEDMONT COURTS was built , ironically , for white people .
It was officially segregated when PIEDMONT COURTS was originally built .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY had tried to do EVEN THOSE RENOVATIONS on that property in THE 1980S , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , to keep THE HOUSING AUTHORITY from falling apart , but TWENTY YEARS later , EVEN THOSE RENOVATIONS had pretty much worn out and SOMEWHAT WITH THE PRIOR BUILDING STRUCTURES AND STYLES were not viable for any further rehab .
So THE HOUSING AUTHORITY applied for one of these federal grants under THE HOPE VI PROGRAM , which is the latest incarnation of urban renewal , which is focused on destroying THE OLDER PUBLIC HOUSING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY and doing some form of reuse of THAT LAND , WHICH USUALLY TAKES THE FORM OF MIXED-USE HOUSING , MOST OF WHICH IS NOT AFFORDABLE TO THE ORIGINAL RESIDENTS THAT ARE BEING DISPLACED .
THE LAST ONE is , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , the FOURTH Hope VI project for CHARLOTTE and THE LAST ONE may be THE LAST ONE , because TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think THE CONGRESS is not even interested in continuing THE HOPE VI PROGRAM , even though THE CONGRESS has the effect of demolishing a lot of unpopular public housing that 's old .
Even that does n't seem to have very much support in THE CONGRESS .
What 's been YOUR sense of what 's happened to THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS ?
Well , the real short answer is TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't know what 's happened with THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT know that THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS have been offered other places and THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS 've in fact relocated .
Most of THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT believe , have gotten these portable Section 8 vouchers that have allowed THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS to rent private dwellings .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that probably most of THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS feel like THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS 's better than what THE PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE DEMOLITION OF PIEDMONT COURTS had before , because PIEDMONT COURTS had become deteriorated and there were still some serious crime problems .
Unfortunately , a lot of JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS just thought any other place would be better than having to live there , and for THE REASON I BECAME INVOLVED IN IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO BE THE POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE VEHICLE TO DO MORE HOUSING WORK THAN THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE COULD BE , JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS have n't come to OUR OFFICE and complained .
But somewhat to the credit of THE HOUSING AUTHORITY , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that out of THE CRITICISM that JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS receive from JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS handling of the FIRST Hope VI project in Earle Village that was somewhat featured in that article in the paper , JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS have become a whole lot more sensitive to developing more feasible and likeable alternatives for THE RELOCATEES .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think SOME OF THEM ALSO DID TRANSFER TO OTHER PUBLIC HOUSING VACANCIES AND I THINK THEY HAVE PROMISED TO LET PEOPLE COME BACK to the new developments as long as SOME OF THEM ALSO DID TRANSFER TO OTHER PUBLIC HOUSING VACANCIES AND I THINK THEY HAVE PROMISED TO LET PEOPLE COME BACK can qualify to be there , which means some of SOME OF THEM ALSO DID TRANSFER TO OTHER PUBLIC HOUSING VACANCIES AND I THINK THEY HAVE PROMISED TO LET PEOPLE COME BACK will need to be able to work , and some of SOME OF THEM ALSO DID TRANSFER TO OTHER PUBLIC HOUSING VACANCIES AND I THINK THEY HAVE PROMISED TO LET PEOPLE COME BACK may be able to do SOME OF THEM ALSO DID TRANSFER TO OTHER PUBLIC HOUSING VACANCIES AND I THINK THEY HAVE PROMISED TO LET PEOPLE COME BACK .
SOME OF THEM PROBABLY already have JOBS THAT WILL PAY ENOUGH TO BE IN THE REPLACEMENT HOUSING , but whether SOME OF THEM PROBABLY 'll have JOBS THAT WILL PAY ENOUGH TO BE IN THE REPLACEMENT HOUSING , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think remains to be seen .
But THE HOUSING AUTHORITY , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , did a much better job trying to accommodate the needs of THE RELOCATEES in PIEDMONT COURTS as a result of SOME OF THE CRITICISM SOME OF THE CRITICISM got before and also from having written a better plan THE THIRD TIME , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think .
Just by way of summing up then , how would just describe the progress CHARLOTTE has made in A VERY DIFFICULT TIME YOUR 've worked here and lived here , in terms of closing the gap between rich and poor ?
Well , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that the severity of the conditions POOR PEOPLE lived in from the early 1970s and before , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think has certainly been ameliorated .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that the quality of THE HOUSING THAT WAS THERE WHEN THE NEW PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 1980 now is so much better as a result of state law changes and also some amendments to THE HOUSING CODE , including the requirement that there actually be heating equipment in OTHER PEOPLE 'S HOUSES UNKNOWN TO THE HOST FAMILY 'S LANDLORD , WHICH CREATES A PRECARIOUS SITUATION .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that the city inspection process has worked well .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think the landlord community has largely accepted the new responsibilities .
What has not happened is there is any real improvement in the economic buying power of the lower-income community .
THE MINIMUM WAGE , WHO REALLY COULD NOT AFFORD TO LIVE HERE has remained so low and the welfare payment level is so low and the disability compensations are so low , that THE PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST STRATA OF THE COMMUNITY can barely afford to live here .
If THE PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST STRATA OF THE COMMUNITY can get more income from any sources , THE PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST STRATA OF THE COMMUNITY can do much better .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT mean , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think there is A WHOLE LOT available in terms of amenities in housing and good places to live and work .
THIS is not unique to CHARLOTTE .
THIS 's true all over A STATE OF DISREPAIR over THE COUNTRY .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think the economic trends show that .
There 's not much YOUR can do tinkering with A LOCAL GOVERNMENT and a local economy that will address A LOCAL GOVERNMENT .
A LOCAL GOVERNMENT 's A LOCAL GOVERNMENT .
If A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ca n't be done on THE LOCAL LEVEL , what do YOUR think ultimately is going address this wage and income gap YOUR 're describing ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT ca n't quite get A VISION OF THAT .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think A VISION OF THAT 's going to be a crisis that will have to get to a certain proportion where JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS will speak on behalf of the lowest-income strata .
That is , enough employers will start to say , `` WE 've got to have more affordable housing because WE ca n't have THE WORKERS close enough to WE places to operate what WE have , what WE need to fill with THE WORKERS , and THE WORKERS are going to have enough skills to do what WE do .
So WE 're going to have to have enough educational training and enough competence from MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS to work .
WE 're going to have to have enough income in THE FAMILIES so that the kids who come to school are n't coming ill-clothed and hungry . ''
MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS 's really MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS .
JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS 're all sort of inextricable from one another .
PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING THE MINIMUM WAGE now can not afford decent homes , RENTAL or ownership , without some other supplement .
RENTAL just does n't work .
THE NORTH CAROLINA JUSTICE CENTER has published some great studies that demonstrate how minimum wage will not buy half of what THE NORTH CAROLINA JUSTICE CENTER takes to live and own a car and rent a home and feed and clothe JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS ; THE NORTH CAROLINA JUSTICE CENTER will not do JUST TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY CREDITORS .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think as THAT PHENOMENON grows , THAT PHENOMENON 's going to create TRULY SEVERE CRISES FOR FAMILIES in other institutions that TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think will force some change .
What role do YOUR see race playing in TRULY SEVERE CRISES FOR FAMILIES that YOUR 're describing here ?
Well , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that in THE SHORT RUN , THE SHORT RUN 's THE SHORT RUN that all poor people are PEOPLE OF COLOR and PEOPLE OF COLOR is somewhat of a hindrance , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , to conservative-dominated legislatures at the state and federal level to want to address PEOPLE OF COLOR .
THE SHORT RUN 's very unclear what impact this national crisis over immigrants and particularly Latinos will have on this .
MY THOUGHT is that how MY THOUGHT is resolved will also impact the whole issue of minimum wages , health care provision , and funding of THE SCHOOLS that we 've never seen before .
MY THOUGHT 's extremely important that MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS is now MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 'd say that MY THOUGHT 's very much up for grabs as to whether or not the upper-middle-class leadership in THE CHERRY COMMUNITY is going to continue to support and provide resources for MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS or abandon MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS , like what has happened in most of the metropolitan communities in THE COUNTRY .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT look at what happened in Mobile , where the middle-class leadership has abandoned the public school systems and YOUR 've got THREE school systems .
YOUR 've got the private school system , the parochial school system , and THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM , which is predominately black and poorly funded .
If CHARLOTTE goes to THE LEVEL OF THAT HOSTILITY where THEY ca n't pass bonds for school expansion and THEY ca n't pay enough salaries to get GOOD ENOUGH TEACHERS to maintain order and decent scores for GOOD ENOUGH TEACHERS students , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think CHARLOTTE will deteriorate into essentially a second-class system that will not be redeemed .
So in other words , THEY can sort of look to THE SCHOOLS to see where THE REST OF THE CITY 'S HEALTH is ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think THE REST OF THE CITY 'S HEALTH 's THE REST OF THE CITY 'S HEALTH .
Right now , THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN CHARLOTTE is saying , `` WE need to go ahead and support THE SCHOOLS and maintain THEY , because FURNITURE COMPANIES , FURNITURE COMPANIES , want to know about whether THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM is positive or not . ''
As long as THEY still ask THEY and THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN CHARLOTTE wants to attract more business to THE CHERRY COMMUNITY , then THEY see that as something THEY has to be addressed .
But if THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN CHARLOTTE ever gets to ONE POINT where the whispering campaign says , `` YOUR can forget the public schools .
Everybody of substance is going to go to private schools and THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN CHARLOTTE does n't matter , '' then WE will have completely institutionalized class strata in every way .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think because of what JUDGE MCMILLAN THAT FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT DID COVER UNBORN CHILDREN FOR THESE PROGRAMS did with MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS and THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT upholding MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS , WE had a truly integrated school system where the upper-middle-class and the lower-class people had a common stake to make a school system work .
MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS was probably MECKLENBURG COUNTY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE WOMEN 'S POLITICAL CAUCUS here for thirty years .
If AN ISSUE WE COULD PROBABLY SPEND ANOTHER HOUR AT LEAST TALKING ABOUT is lost , TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think WE will have an almost irreversible disconnect between the poor and the wealthy in THE CHERRY COMMUNITY .
Well , SARAH THUESEN know AN ISSUE WE COULD PROBABLY SPEND ANOTHER HOUR AT LEAST TALKING ABOUT 's AN ISSUE WE COULD PROBABLY SPEND ANOTHER HOUR AT LEAST TALKING ABOUT , but YOUR 've already been very generous with YOUR time today .
Was there anything that YOUR had wanted to bring up that SARAH THUESEN have n't asked YOUR ?
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't think so .
TED FILLETTE IN THE OFFICES OF LEGAL AID OF NORTH CAROLINA-OR LEGAL AID OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think WE 've covered all the main points pretty well .
Well , thanks so much for sharing YOUR time with WE .
Glad to do A VERY DIFFICULT TIME .
