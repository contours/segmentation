Today is Thursday , August 17 , 2006 .
MY NAME is SARAH THUESEN .
SARAH THUESEN am interviewing for THE LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT , THE LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT .
Today SARAH THUESEN 'm talking with THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS at the Pickwick Hotel .
Thanks very much for taking the time to talk with SARAH THUESEN .
Thank JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE for calling and extending THE INVITATION .
Well , THE INVITATION 's THE INVITATION .
SARAH THUESEN thought we 'd FIRST just talk a little bit about YOUR background and learn JUST A LITTLE BIT more about YOUR earlier history , then talk some about YOUR career both at THE VA HOSPITAL and in politics .
Where did YOUR grow up ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was born in DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM , Alabama .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS grew up in DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM , Alabama .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to THE SCHOOL THOSE DAYS THE SCHOOL was elementary , FIRST grade through EIGHTH and then high school .
After THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS finished high school THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS undergraduate degree at TUSKEGEE , then THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE , slash ALABAMA A&M UNIVERSITY now .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS graduated from THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE , went on to THE UAB in medical technology .
THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE was THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE .
They , every year , came to different black universities to see which ONES OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT WERE INTERESTED IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY to see if ONES OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT WERE INTERESTED IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY would apply to THE UAB .
Prior to THAT TIME BLACK STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA , if THAT TIME BLACK STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA wanted to get a degree in medical technology , THE STATE OF ALABAMA , because of THE SEGREGATED LAWS , would pay for THAT TIME BLACK STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA to go to other states to do THEIR INTERNSHIP in medical technologies .
At THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS , and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS guess maybe TWO OF US or three years prior to THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS , there was an attempt to integrate THE SCHOOL OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY FOR UAB WHICH HAD FAILED BECAUSE THE STUDENTS WOULD APPLY TO THE SCHOOL but THAT TIME BLACK STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA were harassed and ended up dropping out of THE LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT and going to THE OTHER SCHOOLS outside of the state to complete THEIR INTERNSHIP for medical technology .
After THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS started working at THE VA HOSPITAL IN BIRMINGHAM , got THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS MBA degree from ALABAMA A&M UNIVERSITY .
Growing up in DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM we had segregated THE OTHER SCHOOLS .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had a few schools for BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES .
The black community most often JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had MORE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS FIRST entered elementary school in '54 PARKER HIGH SCHOOL was PARKER HIGH SCHOOL .
Later on , WE got one high school that came into THE CITY , JACKSON , only because BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES became annexed into THE CITY , JACKSON .
WE had Ullman High School .
During THE EARLY '50S THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think there were many articles written that PARKER High School was probably PARKER HIGH SCHOOL .
THE EARLY '50S was THE EARLY '50S .
By THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS finished elementary school , because of segregated issues to desegregate , MORE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS had heightened .
Then what THE CITY , JACKSON thought BLACKS IN THIS CITY would do is build a new high school , which was CARVER HIGH SCHOOL , to relieve the overflowing of PARKER HIGH SCHOOL and at THE SAME TIME satisfy THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH .
So JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE do n't have to worry about trying to integrate WE white high schools .
WE 're going to give JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE a spanking brand new high school for JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to concentrate on .
Then after BLACKS IN THIS CITY built CARVER BLACKS IN THIS CITY came back and BLACKS IN THIS CITY built the Hayes High School .
Ultimately THE SITUATION developed that BLACKS IN THIS CITY had to integrate OUR WHITE HIGH SCHOOLS anyway .
THE SITUATION took part during MY NINTH GRADE YEAR in high school .
SOME OF MY FRIENDS and church members that were in the tenth grade , A YOUNG LADY , Patricia Patton was one of the FIRST students , outside of Reverend Shuttlesworth 's children , that was trying to integrate THE THEN PHILLIPS HIGH SCHOOL .
SOME OF MY FRIENDS all were a part of that initial effort to integrate THE OTHER SCHOOLS in THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM .
Past that THAT POINT , once THE SCHOOL was integrated , would attend PHILLIPS and some of THE OTHER SCHOOLS automatically .
Prior to that WE had a few - the Graymont Elementary school was all white school .
There was an attempt to integrate that school .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think MOST OF THE YOUNG CHILDREN , THE PARENTS OF THOSE CHILDREN eventually , so THAT PEOPLE up in THE NORTH asked WE , THE YOUNG CHILDREN had such a hard time in THE SCHOOL if THE YOUNG CHILDREN could take THE YOUNG CHILDREN out of THE STATE OF ALABAMA for protection .
MOST OF THE YOUNG CHILDREN , THE PARENTS OF THOSE CHILDREN 's what ended up happening to THE YOUNG CHILDREN .
MANY OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM , once MANY OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM finished high school , MANY OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM left THE CITY , JACKSON .
Because of the mental impact was not able to come back and settle in THE CITY , JACKSON .
During THE SAME TIME , during THE '60S , '63 was when DR. KING sent DR. KING plea out to THE YOUNG CHILDREN to become A PART OF THE MOVEMENT .
Early on we were just going to THOSE MOVEMENT MEETINGS to hear what was going on .
Were YOUR parents involved IN - ?
During THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS most of IN - parents were afraid .
The rationale was that when THEIR BOSSES learned that THEIR BOSSES were participating with THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , then THEIR BOSSES were fired .
In many cases YOUR PARENTS INVOLVED IN - ? would encourage THE CHILDREN THAT WAS IN THE MOVEMENT to go to THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had QUITE A FEW LIKE THE MINISTERS , QUITE A FEW LIKE THE MINISTERS .
In THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS was THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS because MANY OF THE MINISTERS got MANY OF THE MINISTERS basic pay from THEIR CONGREGATION .
MANY OF THE MINISTERS did n't have to experience THE THREAT OF BEING FIRED BECAUSE THEIR LIVING WAS PAID FOR BY THEIR CONGREGATION .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had a lot of ministers that was active in THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT then .
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM .
A lot of THAT PEOPLE brave THAT PEOPLE during THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM and were going to defy THE SEGREGATED STRUCTURE REGARDLESS , THE SEGREGATED STRUCTURE REGARDLESS .
There were many of US at THE NIGHT BEFORE WE , after school US walked from one side of THIS CITY , IF YOU MENTION MY NAME to the other trying to get to A MOVEMENT MEETING .
Then once THE DECISION was made by DR. KING that it would be better to use THE YOUNG CHILDREN to take THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT to the next step-and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS always remember THE NIGHT BEFORE WE .
Because after THE DECISION was made-usually when US would go to THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THE ONES TO SIT DOWN-CHILDREN were THE ONES TO SIT DOWN-CHILDREN stood up around the walls , in the balconies of THE CHURCH .
On that particular night DR. KING asked THE ONES TO SIT DOWN-CHILDREN , `` Why do n't JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE step back and let THE CHILDREN THAT WAS IN THE MOVEMENT come forth ? '' DR. KING message that THE NIGHT BEFORE WE was to THE CHILDREN THAT WAS IN THE MOVEMENT .
YOUR were present at A MOVEMENT MEETING ?
A MOVEMENT MEETING was at SIXTEENTH STREET BAPTIST CHURCH .
WE were always in THE BALCONY , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS mean , A PROUD MOMENT .
Here THE BALCONY is DR. KING TELLING THE GROWN PEOPLE STEP BACK AND LET THE CHILDREN COME FORTH BECAUSE HIS MESSAGE WAS FOR US .
DR. KING TELLING THE GROWN PEOPLE STEP BACK AND LET THE CHILDREN COME FORTH BECAUSE HIS MESSAGE WAS FOR US preached THE NIGHT BEFORE WE about WE role and how THE NIGHT BEFORE WE relates back to biblical times when THINGS were hard , in many cases , THE YOUNG CHILDREN were used in order to propel the spiritual message that got out then .
THE NIGHT BEFORE WE was , to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS , A PROUD MOMENT .
After DR. KING TELLING THE GROWN PEOPLE STEP BACK AND LET THE CHILDREN COME FORTH BECAUSE HIS MESSAGE WAS FOR US finished talking to WE THE NIGHT BEFORE WE THE YOUNG CHILDREN divided WE up according to where WE lived .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS lived in NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I so THE YOUNG CHILDREN had selected - .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS lived in NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I went to CARVER HIGH SCHOOL .
CARVER HIGH SCHOOL ON THE NORTH SIDE , PARKER HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CENTER , ULLMAN HIGH SCHOOL ON THE SOUTH SIDE was CARVER HIGH SCHOOL ON THE NORTH SIDE , PARKER HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CENTER , ULLMAN HIGH SCHOOL ON THE SOUTH SIDE .
Then THE YOUNG CHILDREN pulled from THE YOUNG CHILDREN from FAIRFIELD and surrounding cities .
MILES COLLEGE is located in FAIRFIELD .
So THAT TIME BLACK STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA came in from MILES COLLEGE .
THE NIGHT BEFORE WE he explained to US that THE NIGHT BEFORE WE were supposed to leave school that US met at one of the churches close to THE SCHOOL .
US met at St. Luke AME Methodist Church .
During THAT PARTICULAR MEETING THAT TIME BLACK STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA gave US US signal .
At THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think JULIAN BOND was JULIAN BOND .
SEVERAL OTHER ONES was out and SEVERAL OTHER ONES explained to US when THE PEOPLE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SCHOOL saw THE PEOPLE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SCHOOL out on THE CAMPUS JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE know that THE CAMPUS 's going to be the signal for JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to get JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE classmates and leave THE SCHOOL .
MANY OF YOUR TEACHERS , MANY OF YOUR TEACHERS were threatened also by the board .
In many cases YOUR TEACHERS would even open up a book and start reading-I do n't see what 's going on .
US quietly got up , left THE SCHOOL , proceeded to DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM and , mind JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE , it was already determined that some children would be arrested .
US was already decided that SOME would be arrested ; some would just keep THE MARCHES GOING .
Once US left school and got DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM , during THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS , SOME told US the students from PARKER HIGH SCHOOL were n't leaving .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have to understand what was happening with PARKER HIGH SCHOOL because PARKER HIGH SCHOOL was where most of THE ELITIST CHILDREN went to school .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think THE ELITIST CHILDREN had some with SECOND thoughts .
If THE ELITIST CHILDREN were identified as marching then YOUR FAMILY will happen to THE ELITIST CHILDREN parents who were YOUR TEACHERS and the business professional people in THE CITY , JACKSON .
THE ELITIST CHILDREN divided US up at THAT POINT and asked some children to go to PARKER HIGH SCHOOL because THE ONES TO SIT DOWN-CHILDREN knew THE ONES TO SIT DOWN-CHILDREN could n't go in .
THE CHILDREN THAT WAS IN THE MOVEMENT could go in and rally THE CHILDREN THAT WAS IN THE MOVEMENT to come on out , which US did .
Some went to PARKER .
SOME proceeded on to SIXTEENTH STREET BAPTIST CHURCH to start THE MARCHES GOING .
SOME had a list of all the children that would potentially be arrested once US got to THE PARK .
Some of US , only thing US did everyday was go and keep THE MARCHES GOING going .
People like MY BROTHER got arrested TWO OF US or THREE times .
What 's MY NAME ?
MY NAME was THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE was ANOTHER YOUNG MAN that was killed during the Vietnam and RAYFIELD name is-that was killed-I always could see HIS FACE , never can remember MY NAME .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS know RAYFIELD was one of the football players because most of SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE had committed that SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE would be arrested .
Part of THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT was that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE needed enough young men to be arrested because there was uncertainty as to what would happen to THE YOUNG LADIES .
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE were going in for a TWO OF US fold purpose because of THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and also to look out for THE YOUNG LADIES once THE YOUNG LADIES were arrested .
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE herded SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE all on buses and hurried SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE to various places in THE CITY , JACKSON .
Used to be called , THE CITY , JACKSON 's still called the Fairground where SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE housed A LOT OF THE CHILDREN .
THE CITY , JACKSON was during ' 63 .
WE got through that faze and went on eventually to integrate MORE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS .
Later on after THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS finished high school in '66 SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR FOOTBALL TEAM , MY BROTHER RAYFIELD , CLARENCE BYRD , AND THERE more or less stepped up the integration process after THE THEN .
Like MY YOUNGER BROTHERS , MY YOUNGER BROTHERS decided that even though MY YOUNGER BROTHERS had been zoned for CARVER HIGH SCHOOL FOR YEARS , but WE lived close to PHILLIPS HIGH SCHOOL , so many of THE CHILDREN THAT WAS IN THE MOVEMENT would have to go to PHILLIPS .
Then , when CARVER HIGH SCHOOL FOR YEARS got to point that SOME OF THE CHILDREN did n't want to go , SOME OF THE CHILDREN started giving THE YOUNG CHILDREN options .
THE ONES THAT DO N'T WANT TO GO YOU can .
THE ONES THAT DO N'T WANT TO GO YOU can go back to whichever high school JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE normally would have attended .
YOUR graduated from CARVER in ' ' 66 . , right ?
' 66 .
Were YOUR ever arrested ?
Never arrested , thank god .
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM always told US US could march as long as US wanted to , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and MY SISTER .
But because of A STAY-AT-HOME MOM lack of trust of the law enforcement at THAT POINT IN TIME , A STAY-AT-HOME MOM told US US could march all day .
MY BROTHER could be arrested because MY BROTHER was MY BROTHER .
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM just was never certain as to what could possibly happen to A YOUNG LADY .
US marched and marched and marched and marched EVERYDAY WHEN WE IN SESSION .
Just like US were going to work until THE MARCHES GOING were called off .
Every day US got up , went to THE CHURCH , got out there and marched , ran from THE POLICEMEN , look around the corner to see if US see BULL CONNOR and his white tank .
Once US could get past , then zoom back into the park US go .
When the police started chasing US US 'd run THE POLICEMEN and run to some place of safety to hide out .
Once THE POLICEMEN would give up US 'd come out and run right back into THE PARK again .
A LOT OF THE CHILDREN was A LOT OF THE CHILDREN .
THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT is to have lived through THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS , during THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM and to know MY FRIENDS - .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS met A YOUNG LADY while THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was campaigning ; THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS met a lady MY NINTH GRADE YEAR .
A YOUNG LADY was telling THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS , `` Yeah , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was in THE PARK . ''
A YOUNG LADY was hit by THE HOSE IN HER CHEST .
A YOUNG LADY said , `` THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS never recovered because A DANGEROUS TIME has resulted in a lot of MEDICAL PROBLEMS . ''
A DANGEROUS TIME was A DANGEROUS TIME but THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS could see where DR. KING was coming from .
A DANGEROUS TIME 's like today , THE YOUNG CHILDREN think THE YOUNG CHILDREN going to live forever , nothing can hurt US because US are THE YOUNG CHILDREN .
US 're strong .
US 've been promised life .
US are fearless .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think that if it had not happened like that SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT OCCURRED IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN AROUND THE WORLD would not have taken place , if SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT OCCURRED IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN AROUND THE WORLD had not been for THE YOUNG CHILDREN .
SARAH THUESEN 'm sure YOUR parents must have been really worried about YOUR at A DANGEROUS TIME .
What did YOUR PARENTS INVOLVED IN - ? do ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think MOST PARENTS during that time-you have to realize THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH during THOSE DAYS , highly religious .
MOST PARENTS was that GOD was going to protect US anyway .
MOST PARENTS US were doing something that was to help everybody .
MOST PARENTS felt certain at the end of THE DAY , US were going to return home and get up another day and start all over again .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't think the fear was there even with MOST PARENTS .
With MOST PARENTS and MOST PARENTS religious background , THE WAY WE 'LL HAVE TO DO IT , THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS is THE WAY WE 'LL HAVE TO DO IT , THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS .
DR. KING was DR. KING .
DR. KING said THE WAY WE 'LL HAVE TO DO IT , THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS is THE WAY WE 'LL HAVE TO DO IT , THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS , then THE WAY WE 'LL HAVE TO DO IT , THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS was THE WAY WE 'LL HAVE TO DO IT , THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS .
NO PARENT thought that MOST PARENTS child was going to go out and be hurt .
Even when MOST PARENTS brought out THE DOGS and the hose pipes , THE WAY WE 'LL HAVE TO DO IT , THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS still did n't affect MOST PARENTS that way because through MOST PARENTS MOST PARENTS believe WE 'll continue to pray .
THE WAY WE 'LL HAVE TO DO IT , THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS is what WE 've got to go through .
What did YOUR parents do here in DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM ?
MY FATHER worked at one of the plants in NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I .
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM , during THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS , A STAY-AT-HOME MOM was A STAY-AT-HOME MOM .
Most of THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM had to work , we were all poor .
Men worked .
THOSE DAYS WOMEN stayed at home and took CARE OF THE CHILDREN until THOSE DAYS WOMEN got to be a certain age .
THOSE DAYS WOMEN 's when most women would move out and go to work in different places .
Prior to THE THEN A STAY-AT-HOME MOM was A STAY-AT-HOME MOM until all of us got in school .
Once all of us got in school then THE THEN went out to work .
What plant was YOUR dad at ?
BIRMINGHAM TANK COMPANY .
BIRMINGHAM TANK COMPANY . 's located now in Pascagoula , Mississippi .
They build these huge tanks that go underground for different things .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS guess for water , oil or whatever .
Was YOUR dad ever involved in labor organizing ?
Yes .
MY DADDY was union .
MY DADDY was union and THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT is when THEY unionized MY DADDY company , when THEY said strike .
MY DADDY struck .
Which union was MY DADDY - ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't remember A PART OF AFL-CIO but A PART OF AFL-CIO was A PART OF AFL-CIO .
They unionized .
A FEW COMPANIES managed to get unionized during THOSE DAYS .
Like in NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had Sloss Industries and Sloss was unionized .
BIRMINGHAM TANK COMPANY . was unionized .
ACIPCO -LSB- American Cast IRON PIPE COMPANY -RSB- , which is still one of the major companies , never unionized .
THEIR company was thoroughly unionized .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS remember THE STRIKES when THEIR went on THE STRIKES for BETTER PAY , better conditions and THINGS .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE just go up and take HIM HIM lunch while HIM sitting on THE PICKET LINE .
THEIR make THEIR little fire and sit there THOSE DAYS and THOSE DAYS in .
Originally , when THEIR would start having to-before the food stamp era in the South-people in MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM just help JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE out .
If MY FATHER worked at ONE OF THE COMPANIES and ONE OF THE COMPANIES was a unionized company and A FEW COMPANIES went on strike , PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD made sure JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had food to eat .
WE all kind of merged together .
All of us was in basically the same economic condition which WE did n't know ONE OF THE COMPANIES was poor at THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS .
From A CHILD 'S perspective , everything was going okay .
PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD made sure that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE did n't go hungry .
Somebody always stepped in and made sure THE RENT was paid .
THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY did as much as PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD could then .
Everything from A CHILD 'S perspective was okay .
Do YOUR remember YOUR DAD TALKING ABOUT WHY UNION MEMBERSHIP WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HIM ?
During THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS , BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES had never been BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES .
BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES always had to do the hardest part of THE JOB .
THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT was THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT was THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT .
First of all , UNIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER came in and if JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are in a unionized facility JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could get BETTER PAY .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE can get BETTER PAY .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE can have THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT that THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY would eventually fight for JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to get A BETTER POSITION , even though during those segregated times A BETTER POSITION was difficult .
THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY was THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY .
What THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY did , THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY made sure that whether JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are black , white , pink or blue , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE share a similar income .
THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY was one of his things .
HE was die hard union .
HE could see the advances made as far as pay and working conditions once THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY came into HE plant .
Was HE union fairly integrated in terms of - ?
During THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS , even though THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS was fairly integrated , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE still had THE WHITE HOUSE .
All of them stood on THE PICKET LINE .
All of them built that one little fire that they all sat around because everybody was in the same situation .
When JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE go back and JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE look , that probably was the most integrated part of American life , was THOSE MEMBERS OF THE UNION .
THOSE MEMBERS OF THE UNION all were fighting together to improve THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE .
It seems as though THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE broke down color barriers .
Getting JUST A LITTLE BIT more into YOUR own experience with labor organizing , tell SARAH THUESEN JUST A LITTLE BIT about when YOUR started working at THE VA HOSPITAL .
At THE VA HOSPITAL .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went into THE VA HOSPITAL , at THAT POINT IN TIME , when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got there , THEY had A UNION OF SORTS .
What year was that ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to work in ' 71 .
THEY had A UNION OF SORTS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS mean from A CHILD 'S PERSPECTIVE that THEY had gone through THE PROCESS OF PETITION .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have to understand , OUR bosses is CONGRESS and THE PRESIDENT FOR THEM .
THEIR BOSSES had already , with the help of THE AFL-CIO , gone ahead and petitioned CONGRESS and THE PRESIDENT FOR THEM to have the ability to form A UNION .
Normally YOUR FAMILY ends up happening , if A PLACE wants to become unionized THEIR BOSSES got to get - .
THE AFL-CIO will FIRST come in and JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE contact THEIR BOSSES and say OUR 're interested in unionizing OUR work place .
Then YOUR FAMILY has to happen after YOUR FAMILY is THEIR BOSSES have to get so many signatures of the employees to say that OUR want to become unionized .
OUR are petitioning to be allowed to have THE EARLY DAYS OF THE UNION , the employees to determine if OUR was going to happen .
OUR had already taken place at THE VA HOSPITAL when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got there .
THE EARLY DAYS OF THE UNION was THE EARLY DAYS OF THE UNION .
To say that THE EARLY DAYS OF THE UNION was THE EARLY DAYS OF THE UNION , OUR were recognized as having a bargaining unit .
THE AFL-CIO was OUR bargaining unit for OUR .
Any time OUR needed to have wage discussions or better working conditions , THE ONES THAT WERE EDUCATIONALLY SEEKING MORE STUDENTS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BLACK were THE ONES THAT WERE EDUCATIONALLY SEEKING MORE STUDENTS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BLACK .
To date , probably AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES , PROBABLY STILL ONE OF THE YOUNGER UNIONS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE UNITED MINE WORKERS , THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS , AND THOSE TYPES OF UNIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER , AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES , PROBABLY STILL ONE OF THE YOUNGER UNIONS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE UNITED MINE WORKERS , THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS , AND THOSE TYPES OF UNIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER 's AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES , PROBABLY STILL ONE OF THE YOUNGER UNIONS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE UNITED MINE WORKERS , THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS , AND THOSE TYPES OF UNIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER .
As OUR matured and finally got full union status of being AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES , PROBABLY STILL ONE OF THE YOUNGER UNIONS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE UNITED MINE WORKERS , THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS , AND THOSE TYPES OF UNIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER and establishing THE VARIOUS LOCALS and the various departments of THE GOVERNMENT , even though OUR still come under THE AFL-CIO .
In many cases THE VARIOUS LOCALS are still there to guide OUR in whatever OUR are doing .
OUR still have OUR president .
OUR have OUR national president , OUR national officers , OUR local officers now .
OUR took some years of growing to get to THAT POINT .
Early on , being a union member at THE VA HOSPITAL , THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL was very difficult .
A lot of times management would harass JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE were given the toughest job and given orders to do THINGS that was just totally unreasonable .
As WE grew in strength and when EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE finally saw that through the suffering of THOSE MEMBERS OF THE UNION , THEN THE CONDITIONS got better .
To give JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE MATURED , THERE USED TO BE A TIME IN THE VA HOSPITAL-IF YOU IN NURSING , well , anything in a hospital-it could be a twenty-four hour shift .
AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE MATURED , THERE USED TO BE A TIME IN THE VA HOSPITAL-IF YOU IN NURSING 's one thing that in any hospital with the staff .
Early on WE worked under STRICT MILITARY RULES .
Everything WE did was according to military time-everything in the operation of THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL was military oriented .
As WE got more and more into being recognized as A UNION and could get to the bargaining table to say that CIVILIANS THAT ARE WORKING THERE THAT DO N'T COME UNDER THE COMPASS OF THE MILITARY are CIVILIANS THAT ARE WORKING THERE THAT DO N'T COME UNDER THE COMPASS OF THE MILITARY and WE 've got to come up with some different guidelines that 's - .
Even though MANY OF THE WORKERS STILL AT THE VA are MANY OF THE WORKERS STILL AT THE VA JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE still have CIVILIANS THAT ARE WORKING THERE THAT DO N'T COME UNDER THE COMPASS OF THE MILITARY .
Those types of THINGS-HOURS to work .
THINGS-HOURS could come in and tell JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE , well JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE put in eight hours JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got to work EIGHT more hours .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could put in that sixteen hours , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE need to work JUST A LITTLE BIT longer until JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE .
THEN THE CONDITIONS were extremely rough .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE almost had no voice .
As OUR union grew and as OUR got to A POINT that OUR were recognized as the bargaining voice of THE WORKERS STILL AT THE VA , THEN THE CONDITIONS started to change .
To give JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE AN EXAMPLE , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
For TWO YEARS THE GOVERNMENT did n't recognize MY DEGREE OR ANYTHING nor was BETTER PAY comfortable to MY DEGREE OR ANYTHING .
Through THE UNION EFFORTS eventually degreed EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE other than nurses were recognized and EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE pay status and position in the facility upgraded .
THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY changed working THEN THE CONDITIONS and THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY helped everybody .
THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY got to A POINT that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could n't work but so many hours straight unless JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE volunteered to do A POINT .
We went from THE MANDATORY OVERTIME 'til if it was overtime needed , whether THE MANDATORY OVERTIME was THE MANDATORY OVERTIME , FIRST line that management was supposed to do was to post THE MANDATORY OVERTIME and allow THAT PEOPLE to work THE MANDATORY OVERTIME .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS might have worked in a department all day where THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've been on THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS feet , death could have been on THE PICKET LINE all day , where A PATIENT 'S could have been in surgery .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS could have been in blood bank all day cross matching blood .
Then JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE come back and say THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS need JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to work EIGHT more hours in THIS and THIS .
At THAT POINT THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ability to detect a problem with A PATIENT 'S is minimized .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS could cause A PATIENT 'S some harm .
Over THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM just got to A POINT that rather than having THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE-THEN , that in a hospital setting especially-Social Security covers under the same local that WE do , THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE-THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE-THEN got to THE POINT WHEN BUSH DADDY WAS PRESIDENT that WE could demand better working hours and let the employee , when JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE needed that extra work or people did n't come in , then JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE can always allow DEFENSE-THEN to volunteer FIRST line .
If JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got no volunteers to come up , then JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE try to come up and decide on A ROTATIONAL BASIS WHO WOULD WORK .
WE did A ROTATIONAL BASIS WHO WOULD WORK according to seniority .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE come right down the seniority list and decide one person work overtime THE DAY because nobody would volunteer .
Then THE NEXT DAY JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE go and JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE keep a record of THE NEXT DAY .
Other things that happened in the work place-when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to work for THE VA HOSPITAL all management was white .
SARAH THUESEN was going to ask YOUR YOUR FAMILY - .
All management was white .
Most blacks worked midnight shifts or evening shifts so JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE did n't see US period .
Most of THE WHITES worked day shift and went home .
US took up when 3:30 came in , when THE EVENING SHIFT started then JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE saw THE FEW BLACKS THAT WORKED AT THE HOSPITAL .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to THE VA HOSPITAL in '71 JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could probably count the number of black nurses US had .
In THE LABORATORY THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think US might have had about FIVE blacks working in US laboratory counting THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think US had a staff then of maybe forty or FIFTY FIFTY people working there .
Even down to dietetic service , THE FEW BLACKS THAT WORKED AT THE HOSPITAL worked in dietetic service .
Very few blacks worked as CUSTODIANS .
In fact , THE FEW BLACKS THAT WORKED AT THE HOSPITAL were THE FEW BLACKS THAT WORKED AT THE HOSPITAL .
During THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS the majority of black veterans were sent to THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL .
The majority white came to DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM or Tuscaloosa , some of the other VA facilities .
There was a desegregating effort to take place there .
BLACK DOCTORS were unheard of .
BLACK DOCTORS were unheard of .
WE saw SOME OF OUR FIRST BLACK DOCTORS , like Dr. Rick Ranson is still working in the DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM area .
SOME OF OUR FIRST BLACK DOCTORS came through as interns and residents and just made WE proud to see BLACK DOCTORS .
A lot of integration took place .
Slowly what ended up happening , many of WE white nurses disappeared .
The white there were CUSTODIANS and building maintenance .
THE PEOPLE DOING ALL THE INSTRUMENT REPAIR disappear .
WE engineering department , when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS retired in 2000 , still had a significant number of whites still working in OUR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT .
THE PEOPLE DOING ALL THE INSTRUMENT REPAIR 're THE PEOPLE DOING ALL THE INSTRUMENT REPAIR .
THE PEOPLE DOING ALL THE INSTRUMENT REPAIR call engineering a lot of stuff nowadays .
In WE dietetic service , MOSTLY BLACK .
In the custodial services , MOSTLY BLACK .
In THE LABORATORY , maybe fifty-fifty turned out .
WE began to see MORE BLACKS in management .
MORE BLACKS would bring MORE BLACKS is as-never director of the hospital-but one of his assistant directors .
Most times MORE BLACKS going to put MORE BLACKS over something like PERSONNEL OR THEY would be assistant to the person who was over PERSONNEL OR THEY .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS left WE still , WE never saw A BLACK over THE NURSING SERVICE .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE never saw A BLACK over LABORATORY SERVICES .
So , as far as getting into upper management , LABORATORY SERVICES still did not exist in THE VA HOSPITAL .
During THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM , CLINTON was a godsend for WE because some of the things CLINTON allowed to happen in THE VA HOSPITAL helped everybody in workplaces regardless of THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING .
CLINTON put in the Family Medical Leave .
If A CHILD 'S or a close family member is sick JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE can use YOUR SICK LEAVE TIME to be off to take CARE OF THE CHILDREN .
If JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE did n't have THE SICK LEAVE TIME-YOUR ANNUAL LEAVE IS OUR VACATION LEAVE-YOU could use that to start staying at home .
It was a godsend when THE SICK LEAVE TIME-YOUR ANNUAL LEAVE IS OUR VACATION LEAVE-YOU happened because THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS knew of EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE .
MY FATHER might have had cancer .
EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE had to stay at home or come to work late .
EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE would be so intolerant that EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE would n't even allow an employee to come to work late after EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE got EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE parents situated .
EMPLOYEES THAT WAS FIRED BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD A STROKE would fire THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM because THE JOB is most important .
YOUR FAMILY do n't count .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think CLINTON added some human qualities to THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY and in THE UNION EFFORTS that THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY had been fighting for TWO YEARS .
The time-and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS always remember CLINTON making THE STATEMENT that as president if CLINTON daughter needed CLINTON to come to school for A PROGRAM CLINTON could go .
THE STATEMENT should be given to the everyday worker .
THE STATEMENT helped a lot of MOST PARENTS out .
MOST PARENTS want to go to see MOST PARENTS children perform in school .
MOST PARENTS like to have the opportunity to take AN HOUR or thirty minutes off and go and just be there for support .
MOST PARENTS not only helped in the federal sector but that helped in the civilian sector also .
When YOUR started there in '71 YOUR must have been part of a relatively small number of black employees then ?
Small .
Yeah .
What was '71 like working in A MOSTLY WHITE WORK PLACE AT THAT TIME ? '71 was n't so long after THE '60S .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS tell JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE during that time one thing that 's - .
WE were treated pretty well in A MOSTLY WHITE WORK PLACE AT THAT TIME because THE AVERAGE WHITE THAT would come and say , `` JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are not like THE OTHER BLACKS . ''
`` Why are WE not like THE OTHER BLACKS ? '' `` Because JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got employed . ''
`` Well , there are some other ones that like to be employed , too . ''
`` JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are college educated . ''
The sad thing about THE OTHER BLACKS ? , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to be college educated in order to get THE JOB in THE LABORATORY .
FOUR YEARS AT TUSKEGEE , got a BS degree in Pre-Med , math and science major .
THE AVERAGE WHITE THAT was working in THE LAB , HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA .
SOME relative knew somebody and SOME brought SOME in and trained SOME .
Once SOME got - .
Some did have DEGREES .
It turned out most of US with DEGREES would have to continue to train those that 's been there for TWO YEARS before US even got there .
Another thing that stood out at that time that THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM , as far as FEMALES was concerned , was THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM .
FEMALES would understand THE PROCESS OF PETITION better .
FEMALES was ONE OF THE PROBLEMS that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had to face , that A POSITION FOR WHITE FEMALES WHOSE HUSBANDS ARE IN MEDICAL SCHOOL OR WHITE MALES WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT BECOMING DOCTORS is A POSITION FOR WHITE FEMALES WHOSE HUSBANDS ARE IN MEDICAL SCHOOL OR WHITE MALES WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT BECOMING DOCTORS .
Prior to medical technology doing all the lab work , BLACK DOCTORS did ONE OF THE PROBLEMS .
YOUR INTERNS , YOUR RESIDENTS , YOUR INTERNS , YOUR RESIDENTS worked in THE LABORATORY .
DENTAL STUDENTS worked in THE LABORATORY .
Like when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS did THEIR INTERNSHIP , THEIR INTERNSHIP 's all THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS saw .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got to THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL and realized DENTAL STUDENTS were THE ONES THAT WERE EDUCATIONALLY SEEKING MORE STUDENTS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BLACK .
WE were treated pretty well .
WE were put on THAT MIDNIGHT SHIFT and THE EVENING SHIFT so no one would see WE .
When THE MAJORITY WHITE PATIENTS came into THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL to have HIS LAB WORK or if THE MAJORITY WHITE PATIENTS had to see a nurse , THE MAJORITY WHITE PATIENTS saw white .
Did YOUR work the night shift for how many years ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS worked THE NIGHTSHIFT for so long .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was on nightshift almost twelve years .
Little by little , during that twelve year cycle , THEY started putting more and more blacks on dayshift .
The thing THEY told THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to work there was that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE know THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT , THEY have to work all the holidays .
All THE HOLIDAYS ? THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm coming out of college , all the holidays ? THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't get any time off .
THEY philosophy lasted until THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY matured enough that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE just ca n't make THE PEOPLE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SCHOOL work all the holidays .
In some cases that meant that if on THE HOLIDAYS JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 'd have no patients coming into clinic , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS might have to come in and work midnight and not get off until four o'clock THE NEXT DAY .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS worked the dayshift because THE WHITES stay at HER HOME and JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE work .
WE might end up doing TWO OF US shifts .
THINGS changed through THE UNION EFFORTS .
THE WHITES got TWO OF US to THE POINT WHEN BUSH DADDY WAS PRESIDENT , FIRST of all more of WE was able to work dayshift then .
Little by little , the challenge through , not THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY now , but THE EEOC .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had the equal opportunity act that required THE WHITES when THE WHITES started posting MANAGERIAL POSITIONS that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE open THE DOORS up for BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES to apply for MANAGERIAL POSITIONS , too .
WE had a lot of THE EEOC complaints .
One of my major ones , because at one point in TIME , LIKE I SAID , MOST CASES WE GOT ALONG THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was a union steward and the union representative to sit on the THE EEOC committee .
During THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS WE realized that THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL was paying BLACK NURSES a different salary than BLACK NURSES were paying OUR WHITE NURSES .
About what year would that have been ?
THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS was like THE LATE '70S , the early '80s .
Then what ended up happening , WE started looking more and more at THE EEO RECORDS that THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL was sending into WASHINGTON DC .
THE QUESTION THAT I HAD TO ASK ON THOSE RECORDS then was THE QUESTION THAT I HAD TO ASK ON THOSE RECORDS had down there that WE had blacks in administration and nursing service .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS started going around asking BLACK NURSES .
Can JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE identify the black nurse that is also THE ADMINISTRATOR 'S ? Nobody could find BLACK NURSES .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think BLACK NURSES was one of the major turnovers in THE VA HOSPITAL .
Through THE EEOC and THE UNION EFFORTS BLACK NURSES had to eventually start promoting BLACK NURSES to administrative roles .
Originally started by making BLACK NURSES BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES .
THE NIGHTSHIFT eventually got to dayshift .
Whereas THE HEAD NURSE OR CHIEF OF NURSING SERVICE might have been white or some other minority other than black , THE HEAD NURSE OR CHIEF OF NURSING SERVICE would have a black assistant and numerous black nurses that would fall under .
Then THE NEXT PHASE THAT WE HAD TO FIGHT was that most of the black administrators were FEMALES .
Then WE had to fight to get THE MALE NURSES , THE MALE NURSES .
Because a lot of WE nurses , male , were nurses in THE MILITARY .
Was there SOME REASON that YOUR think management was more inclined to hire BLACK WOMEN than THE BLACK MEN ?
BLACK WOMEN had to hire A SAFETY NET TO SAY IT 'S BETTER TO PUT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IF I 'M A WHITE MALE OR WHITE FEMALE I FEEL LESS THREATENED IF I 'VE GOT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION because BLACK WOMEN were military .
Then surprisingly enough , many of WE black female nurses were military .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think A SAFETY NET TO SAY IT 'S BETTER TO PUT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IF I 'M A WHITE MALE OR WHITE FEMALE I FEEL LESS THREATENED IF I 'VE GOT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION 's always A SAFETY NET TO SAY IT 'S BETTER TO PUT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IF I 'M A WHITE MALE OR WHITE FEMALE I FEEL LESS THREATENED IF I 'VE GOT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION .
A BLACK FEMALE stands LESS OF A CHANCE TO CHALLENGE ME IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT 'S NOT QUITE RIGHT , THAT FEMALE MIGHT TAKE IT AND SAY , `` I CAN DEAL WITH IT . ''
Whereas that black male might say , `` No , LESS OF A CHANCE TO CHALLENGE ME IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT 'S NOT QUITE RIGHT , THAT FEMALE MIGHT TAKE IT AND SAY , `` I CAN DEAL WITH IT 's not LESS OF A CHANCE TO CHALLENGE ME IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT 'S NOT QUITE RIGHT , THAT FEMALE MIGHT TAKE IT AND SAY , `` I CAN DEAL WITH IT .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think A SAFETY NET TO SAY IT 'S BETTER TO PUT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IF I 'M A WHITE MALE OR WHITE FEMALE I FEEL LESS THREATENED IF I 'VE GOT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION just was A SAFETY NET TO SAY IT 'S BETTER TO PUT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IF I 'M A WHITE MALE OR WHITE FEMALE I FEEL LESS THREATENED IF I 'VE GOT A BLACK FEMALE IN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION .
Did YOUR join THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY right away when YOUR FIRST started working there ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS joined THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY MY NINTH GRADE YEAR or so after THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS started working .
SOME REASON why THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS joined THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY is one of the young men that worked in THE NURSING SERVICE , any time HE would come in THE LAB , HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA HE would say , `` Well , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS just see JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE working all the time .
Are JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE ever off ? '' THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS kept telling HE they told THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS , working EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm working , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've got to work THE HOLIDAYS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've got to work THE MANDATORY OVERTIME .
When in reality YOUR FAMILY was happening with THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was different than what was happening to some of FIVE BLACKS WORKING IN OUR LABORATORY COUNTING ME .
To go back to the educational process , when the federal government asked for RECRUITS to come and integrate THE SCHOOL OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY FOR UAB WHICH HAD FAILED BECAUSE THE STUDENTS WOULD APPLY TO THE SCHOOL there was six of us from different schools .
TWO OF US came from TUSKEGEE .
A couple came from , at THAT POINT IN TIME , ALABAMA A&M UNIVERSITY did n't have A PROGRAM .
RECRUITS would , the junior MY NINTH GRADE YEAR , RECRUITS students went to ALABAMA A&M UNIVERSITY .
Then RECRUITS would do RECRUITS internship there .
After RECRUITS finished RECRUITS senior year , RECRUITS recruited some of RECRUITS to come and be in RECRUITS program .
Out of the six that was in THE LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT , ANGELA FINLEY , ANGELA FINLEY , had started at THE UAB .
RECRUITS felt pretty comfortable with ANGELA FINLEY .
But then JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got FIVE blacks that was not a part of THE UAB to come in .
THEIR PHILOSOPHY was that if THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to a predominantly black university THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS should not be able to compete with THE WHITES .
In many cases THE WHITES harassed JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to death .
From THE POINT WHEN BUSH DADDY WAS PRESIDENT , when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS saw THE OTHER FOUR disappear , and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm saying , `` Why did THE WHITES drop out of the curriculum ? '' When THE NEXT DAY came , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would be called to THE ADMINISTRATOR 'S office and THE WHITES would make statements like , `` JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE know BLACK WOMEN are made to have THESE BABIES and not to be in a curriculum like THIS .
THIS is too difficult for JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE . ''
The quarter that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was supposed to take chemistry , THIS would call THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in everyday .
ADMINISTRATORS OF THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM were ADMINISTRATORS OF THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM ?
Right .
ADMINISTRATORS OF THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM had A WAY OF NOT EVER BEING ABLE TO SAY NEGRO .
A WAY OF NOT EVER BEING ABLE TO SAY NEGRO always came out `` Niggras '' are not mentally able to do well in science courses .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE getting ready to take JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE chemistry : `` JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE wo n't do well because JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE just do n't have the mental capacity . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS thought THAT PROCESS : THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS attended THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE .
MY CHEMISTRY INSTRUCTOR was one of the top chemists from Germany .
If THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS could pass DR. GIERACH 'S COURSE , there was nothing at THE UAB that even came close to YOU GOING TO TELL ME LITTLE OLD UAB THAT 'S GOT A SCHOOL OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY OVER THE DEW DROP CAFÉ WHERE WE LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC EVERYDAY , SMELL ALL THE GREASY FOOD , GOING TO TELL ME I .
YOU GOING TO TELL ME LITTLE OLD UAB THAT 'S GOT A SCHOOL OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY OVER THE DEW DROP CAFÉ WHERE WE LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC EVERYDAY , SMELL ALL THE GREASY FOOD , GOING TO TELL ME I was one of the top scientists there that came here on a fellowship .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS took PARASITOLOGY , YOUR BIOLOGY , PARASITOLOGY , YOUR BIOLOGY was one of the top doctors in that field that came from Mayo Clinic .
Now , YOU GOING TO TELL ME LITTLE OLD UAB THAT 'S GOT A SCHOOL OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY OVER THE DEW DROP CAFÉ WHERE WE LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC EVERYDAY , SMELL ALL THE GREASY FOOD , GOING TO TELL ME I ca n't pass YOUR CHEMISTRY COURSES .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 're PARASITOLOGY , YOUR BIOLOGY .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS told THEM that-I had to explain to THEM .
THEM thought THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was crazy .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` Look , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm far superior than anybody that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 'll ever have come through THE RECORD WHERE THE PATIENT HAD A REACTION . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` As A NINTH GRADER LEAVING EIGHTH GRADE GOING TO NINTH GRADE , do JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE not know that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was on COLLEGE CAMPUSES then ? '' During the segregated eras THEM had PROGRAMS WHERE IF YOU EXCELLED IN SCIENCE OR MATH , DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS YOU COULD SPEND IT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY , DOING ADDITIONAL STUDY IN SCIENCE .
In some cases , if JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE did well in English , THEM had PROGRAMS WHERE IF YOU EXCELLED IN SCIENCE OR MATH , DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS YOU COULD SPEND IT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY , DOING ADDITIONAL STUDY IN SCIENCE .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm saying , `` Look here .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 're just getting off the ground and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've had taken YOUR CHEMISTRY COURSES through the few quarters THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've been in and now JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE want to say that A NINTH GRADER LEAVING EIGHTH GRADE GOING TO NINTH GRADE 'm not able to do THIS WHEN EVERYTHING YOU PRESENTED TO ME WAS ON A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL COMPARED TO WHAT I HAD AT TUSKEGEE . ''
THIS WHEN EVERYTHING YOU PRESENTED TO ME WAS ON A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL COMPARED TO WHAT I HAD AT TUSKEGEE would do THINGS like THINGS .
Then what THIS WHEN EVERYTHING YOU PRESENTED TO ME WAS ON A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL COMPARED TO WHAT I HAD AT TUSKEGEE would do is if THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS made AN A or a B on A TEST THIS WHEN EVERYTHING YOU PRESENTED TO ME WAS ON A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL COMPARED TO WHAT I HAD AT TUSKEGEE would tear AN A up in front of the class .
Then all the white students would laugh .
MY CHEMISTRY INSTRUCTOR would come by and say we ca n't let this slip by that a Negro was able to do better on the same level as THE WHITES .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had to endure that TYPE OF MENTAL THING and take JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE mind to A DIFFERENT LEVEL to accept TYPE OF MENTAL THING and say , `` THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm not going to allow JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to tear THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS down . ''
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got to THE VA HOSPITAL after THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS - .
THE WHITES could n't stop THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS from making THE VA HOSPITAL through DR. GIERACH 'S COURSE and doing THEIR INTERNSHIP .
THE WHITES blackballed THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
UAB blackballed THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS to every hospital in DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM and probably in THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
Whenever I went to get A JOB , when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got close to graduation , and started putting in THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS application , THAT PEOPLE would say THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't care what JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are qualified to do , WE 've already gotten MY NAME and WE 're not going to give JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE AN APPLICATION .
THE VA HOSPITAL would give THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AN APPLICATION .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS SECOND thing to do was to call WASHINGTON DC and call Central Office .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE all recruited THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE asked THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS to come to THIS SCHOOL ALONG WITH OTHER STUDENTS to help integrate THIS SCHOOL ALONG WITH OTHER STUDENTS .
Now JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE all got to do something .
What was the agency YOUR were dealing with in WASHINGTON DC ?
The Department of VETERANS AFFAIRS .
THEY govern THE VA HOSPITAL .
THEY were THE ONES THAT WERE EDUCATIONALLY SEEKING MORE STUDENTS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BLACK .
THEY had also recruited YOUR to do the program in the FIRST place ?
THEY were THE ONES THAT WERE EDUCATIONALLY SEEKING MORE STUDENTS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BLACK .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS called and said , `` Look here THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ca n't get A JOB here .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've done what JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE asked THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS to do .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've been successful .
Now , where do THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS get a job ? '' They technically hired THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS from WASHINGTON DC .
All THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to do was report to this VA. .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have to understand that THE VA HOSPITAL and university just like THIS .
THIS did everything in THIS power to discredit THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
Even to THE POINT WHEN BUSH DADDY WAS PRESIDENT that THIS falsif - .
ONLY VACATION that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had , when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS FIRST started working , THIS would not even let THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS take vacation .
After about TWO YEARS or so THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS managed to get vacation time off .
Went on vacation , came back .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was hit with A CHARGE OF TURNING OUT A PATIENT 'S RESULT THAT WAS FALSE .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm saying , `` How did THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do that ? '' THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED IT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN WASHINGTON AND THE PEOPLE IN THESE MAJOR CORPORATIONS DESIGNED THAT LEVEL OF FEAR BECAUSE WHILE WE 'RE DOING THAT WE CA N'T FOCUS ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING . .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'll start ONLY VACATION because we had enough people to cover .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got back THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED IT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN WASHINGTON AND THE PEOPLE IN THESE MAJOR CORPORATIONS DESIGNED THAT LEVEL OF FEAR BECAUSE WHILE WE 'RE DOING THAT WE CA N'T FOCUS ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING . were saying , `` Well , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE know JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE misdiagnosed A PATIENT 'S .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE wrote down A PATIENT 'S lab work in hematology which showed that A PATIENT 'S had Leukemia because JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE misidentified the cells . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS misidentified the cell .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't think so . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to go through THAT PROCESS .
Finally showed out THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was not at WORK THAT NIGHT THE NIGHT BEFORE WE .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE need to find out who WORK THAT NIGHT was that did WORK THAT NIGHT .
WORK THAT NIGHT was one of the white supervisors .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had that to happen all the way up to maybe a few years before THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS retired .
Even to THE POINT WHEN BUSH DADDY WAS PRESIDENT THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to write BUSH DADDY on THE THINGS THAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME FROM BEING EXPELLED FROM THE LABORATORY .
YOUR wrote THE LETTERS to THE WHITE HOUSE ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS wrote THE LETTERS to THE WHITE HOUSE everyday for BUSH DADDY whole four year cycle to tell BUSH DADDY THEY put THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS out of THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL because THEY said that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS because of THE THINGS THAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME FROM BEING EXPELLED FROM THE LABORATORY THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said and did .
THEY wanted to speak up .
THEY did n't want THEY to happen but THEY could n't come up with CHARGES OF ME not doing THE JOB .
In the research wing of THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL , THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL 's where THEY set THE LAB , HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA up .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to do all of the syphilis tests and things of THAT NATURE .
No tech was allowed to come in there .
Supervisor would bring MY WORK LOAD in , in the morning , and put MY WORK LOAD there .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would do MY WORK LOAD , put everything in the computer .
In THE EVENING they would come back with the-we were going through the transition of actually still having the paper copies going to THE FLOOR plus computer copies .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS stayed in THE MANDATORY OVERTIME for about TWO YEARS .
Then when BUSH father left the THE WHITE HOUSE someone called THE VA HOSPITAL to ask-and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was writing SENATOR HEFLIN .
SENATOR HEFLIN was SENATOR HEFLIN .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS wrote both of them .
At THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS something broke about the mistreatment of federal employees .
60 Minutes was interested in doing A STORY .
SOMEHOW or another , in order to cover SOMEHOW butt , SOMEHOW say , `` Well WE 've had someone that 's been keeping on top of THIS . ''
SOMEHOW showed SOMEHOW THE LETTERS that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had written .
THAT PEOPLE started calling MY-MY BOSSES started getting upset , `` Why would THE WHITE HOUSE call WE like THIS to find out what 's happening to JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE ? WE had to tell THAT PEOPLE JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 're one of our best employees and stuff . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS told THAT PEOPLE THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've been writing THAT PEOPLE telling THAT PEOPLE of THE THINGS THAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME FROM BEING EXPELLED FROM THE LABORATORY that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE all would do to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS mean to put THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in AN AREA completely by THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
Then when THAT PEOPLE brought THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS back into THE LABORATORY THAT PEOPLE told MY COWORKERS ' , `` If JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE speak to her more than two seconds JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 'll be written up for insubordination . ''
MY COWORKERS ' friends were afraid to say anything to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
Like THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS guess THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS came through , because of THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA , was able to deal with that level of pressure .
Maybe THREE or four years before THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS retired THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to deal with this the whole time just because THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was one of the FIRST blacks to integrate that school of THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM .
For the majority of thirty years at THE VA HOSPITAL THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to endure situations that OTHER EMPLOYEES did n't have to do .
ONE OF THEIR LAST GREAT EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT ME WAS I came to work ONE MORNING and THIS SUPERVISOR say , `` Here 's A UNIT OF BLOOD that OTHER EMPLOYEES need in intensive care unit .
All JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE need to do when THE HEAD NURSE OR CHIEF OF NURSING SERVICE comes down is just give ONE OF THEIR LAST GREAT EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT ME WAS I to THIS SUPERVISOR .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE do n't have to check THE PAPER WORK .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE do n't have to do anything . ''
Common sense and the discipline in THE PROFESSION says , `` Do n't do THE PROFESSION . ''
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS pulled the paperwork out , pulled A PATIENT 'S card , TWO OF US different types of blood .
Now that supervisor knew that unit was THE WRONG TYPE OF BLOOD .
They would rather sacrifice that patient getting that THE BLOOD to discredit THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
What ended up happening , nurse came to pick up THE BLOOD .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` Give THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS a few minutes .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS detected an error .
Let THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS double check A UNIT OF BLOOD .
Then THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'll bring A UNIT OF BLOOD to THE FLOOR . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS took A UNIT OF BLOOD , put A UNIT OF BLOOD in MY LOCKER .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS cross-matched THE CORRECT UNIT , took THE CORRECT UNIT to THE FLOOR .
Nobody double checked to see what had happened .
About THREE THE NEXT DAY they said , `` We 're going to have to put JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE on leave without pay . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` Why ? '' `` Because JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE gave A PATIENT 'S A UNIT OF BLOOD THE WRONG TYPE OF BLOOD was THE WRONG TYPE OF BLOOD . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` No , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS did n't . ''
`` Yes JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE did and THE RECORD WHERE THE PATIENT HAD A REACTION 's THE RECORD WHERE THE PATIENT HAD A REACTION . ''
THEY had already done the paperwork to say that A PATIENT 'S had done had A REACTION .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` Well , THE WRONG TYPE OF BLOOD 's not true .
But whatever .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm just asking JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to go ahead and have THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS hearing as soon as possible , '' which THEY did within the same week .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to MY LOCKER .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got A UNIT OF BLOOD .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` THE RECORD WHERE THE PATIENT HAD A REACTION 's A UNIT OF BLOOD . ''
The signature is the midnight shift supervisor .
A PATIENT 'S never got A UNIT OF BLOOD , never got A UNIT OF BLOOD .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` A UNIT OF BLOOD was a set up . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS mean , the director and everybody just went haywire .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` Well , all of you have been A PART OF THIS . ''
A PART OF THIS 's just A PART OF THIS .
THIS PARTICULAR SUPERVISOR and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was in THE SAME MED TECH CLASS .
Back in the late '60s huh ?
THE LATE '70S
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to Med Tech school in ' 70 - '71 at THE UAB .
SHE was in THE SAME MED TECH CLASS .
Racist .
Would never sit next to A BLACK PERSON , even if THE SAME MED TECH CLASS meant SHE had to sit outside THE DOOR .
SHE was n't going to sit next to FIVE BLACKS THAT WAS NOT A PART OF UAB TO COME IN .
SOME OF THE WHITES IN OUR CLASS used to make jokes .
What SOME OF THE WHITES IN OUR CLASS would do is THAT EVERYBODY .
THAT EVERYBODY was just - .
Everybody would just fall .
Over TIME , LIKE I SAID , MOST CASES WE GOT ALONG , THAT TIME BLACK STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA did .
MEDICAL PROBLEMS came from THE INSTRUCTORS and THEIR LAST DITCH EFFORT TO TRY TO DISCREDIT ME AS FAR AS MY ABILITY TO WORK IN THE LAB .
THEIR LAST DITCH EFFORT TO TRY TO DISCREDIT ME AS FAR AS MY ABILITY TO WORK IN THE LAB was THE INSTRUCTORS last ditch effort to try to discredit THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS as far as THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ability to work in THE LAB , HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA .
Then at SOME POINT IN TIME , little by little , THE INSTRUCTORS saw that all of the directions for every department , be SOME POINT IN TIME CHEMISTRY , HEMATOLOGY , MICROBIOLOGY , PARASITOLOGY , WHATEVER , CHEMISTRY , HEMATOLOGY , MICROBIOLOGY , PARASITOLOGY , WHATEVER .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had rewritten the directions and procedures for all of our test procedures .
When THE INSTRUCTORS looked in there to try-they said , `` Why did she do THE INSTRUCTORS ? '' When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would be on THAT MIDNIGHT SHIFT THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was tinkering with the procedures .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got to dayshift , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS learned to call the different laboratories , RESEARCH LABS , `` What have JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE done RESEARCH LABS is different to make A TEST better ? '' In the process of THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS going to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS supervisor THE INSTRUCTORS really did n't pay THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS that much attention .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would say , `` Look here .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm contacting so and so lab .
THE INSTRUCTORS think THE INSTRUCTORS have A NEW PROCEDURE . ''
`` Well , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE go on ahead and work A NEW PROCEDURE . ''
A NEW PROCEDURE meant that that kept me occupied and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS did n't have the opportunity to have an impact on the other technologists .
After A NEW PROCEDURE , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS spent THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS last few years at the VA just basically union .
A NEW PROCEDURE had gotten to THE POINT WHEN BUSH DADDY WAS PRESIDENT then THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION , worked A WAY OF NOT EVER BEING ABLE TO SAY NEGRO up through the ranks , spent more time just handling the union cases .
Getting back to YOUR union activity JUST A LITTLE BIT .
When YOUR FIRST got involved with FIRST who were THE LEAD ORGANIZERS ? Who recruited YOUR ?
ANOTHER YOUNG MAN name was-his last name was PARKER .
ANOTHER YOUNG MAN was one of the people on THE NURSING SERVICE .
ANOTHER YOUNG MAN was THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THEY ARE MISTREATING YOU IN THIS LABORATORY .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE need to go and talk to JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE union official .
At THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION was ill .
A BLACK GUY THAT WORKED IN DIETETIC , at THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS , was A BLACK GUY THAT WORKED IN DIETETIC .
THE MAN 'S NAME WAS-HIS LAST NAME was JEROME TUCKER .
A BLACK GUY THAT WORKED IN DIETETIC was THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THEY ARE MISTREATING YOU IN THIS LABORATORY - .
Even when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to A BLACK GUY THAT WORKED IN DIETETIC , even though WE were unionized ' 72 , ' 73 , MY-MY BOSSES - .
At THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS MY-MY BOSSES still kind of had a hold on WE union people .
A LOT OF THE MEANINGFUL CASES that MY-MY BOSSES should have been addressing , MY-MY BOSSES would make A LOT OF THE MEANINGFUL CASES so hard on MY-MY BOSSES that MY-MY BOSSES could n't get THE OFFICIAL TIME .
Even though THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had made MY COMPLAINT JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have a window there of opportunity .
Once PARKER said , `` Well , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE need to make MY COMPLAINT . ''
PARKER had THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS to file A COMPLAINT to the union official as well as THE EEOC .
A COMPLAINT 's what pulled THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS into THE EEOC because of THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS own personal complaint .
Once THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got that satisfied THEN I BECAME - .
THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY said , `` JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 've had more dealings with THEN I BECAME .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE were successful so WE 'll make JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE WE representative to THE EEOC . ''
Basically , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to-because THE UNION PRESIDENT 'S SUPERVISOR limited THE OFFICIAL TIME that THE UNION PRESIDENT 'S SUPERVISOR could talk to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ended up having to learn union procedures on THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS own to fight THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS own situation .
Were THE UNION LEADERS white or black ?
At THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS THE UNION LEADERS were about FIFTY FIFTY .
In fact , THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS might have been more white than black mainly because THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL was mostly white at THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE only had A FEW BLACKS there that was brave enough - .
We were already being discriminated against , the handful that was there , by having to work the late shifts all the time .
One set of STRICT MILITARY RULES were for THE WHITES .
ONE SET OF RULES were for BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES .
The majority of THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT was white .
In fact , one of our most dedicated union workers lost HIS job , basically because HIS had won several major union complaints and was just set up by management .
In fact , THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT promoted one of our most dedicated union stewards to be over THE LABORATORY .
THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT did THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT because THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT figure LINDA knew the union rules and regulation .
LINDA knew where THE WEAK POINTS were .
LINDA learned THE WEAK POINTS from THIS GUY WHO WAS HER BEST FRIEND , ONE OF OUR UNION OFFICIALS .
THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT figured if THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT could break HIS BACK IT WOULD BREAK THE UNION .
When THE PEOPLE THAT WORK EVENING AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT fired THIS GUY WHO WAS HER BEST FRIEND , ONE OF OUR UNION OFFICIALS on drummed up CHARGES OF ME LINDA called THIS GUY WHO WAS HER BEST FRIEND , ONE OF OUR UNION OFFICIALS to LINDA office on THE NEXT DAY because a mediator-he was supposed to have an arbitration case .
THE ARBITRATOR supposedly called LINDA office to find THE ARBITRATOR .
When THE ARBITRATOR could n't find THE ARBITRATOR THE ARBITRATOR was going to return the call to LINDA office .
THE ARBITRATOR went to HER OFFICE TO FIND HIM , was standing in THE DOOR when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS saw THE ARBITRATOR on the phone .
By THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got back , went on THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS break came back ten minutes later ; they said THE ARBITRATOR attacked THE UNION PRESIDENT 'S SUPERVISOR .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` Well THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM 's not true .
THE ARBITRATOR talked on THAT TELEPHONE in the doorway . ''
THAT TELEPHONE was one of the weakness of the union was that .
Anytime THE MANAGER OVER YOU say that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE attack THEM THEM would believe THE MANAGER OVER YOU .
As far as THE MANAGER OVER YOU was concerned SHE was still our chief tech when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS retired .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS never went into AN OFFICE WITH HER , never .
SHE used to would stand and cry in front of THE LABORATORY .
`` THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS does n't trust THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
SHE refused to go and talk to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in AN OFFICE WITH HER . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would n't do AN OFFICE WITH HER .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've seen what JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 've done to HER BEST FRIEND .
If JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE want to speak to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are going to have to speak to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in the middle of THE LABORATORY , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS mean the dead center of THE LABORATORY , so THAT PEOPLE could see JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE from every department .
Every department was just separated by A GLASS WALL .
A GLASS WALL would help at THE NIGHT BEFORE WE that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could see YOUR FAMILY - .
The one or TWO OF US of you that were in THE LABORATORY could see each other .
Were race relations pretty - ? How would YOUR characterize RACE RELATIONS ?
RACE RELATIONS , when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS retired - .
SARAH THUESEN was thinking actually , FIRST of all , within THE UNION IN ITS EARLY DAYS .
Within THE UNION IN ITS EARLY DAYS RACE RELATIONS were fairly okay .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had A FEW WHITES THAT FELT THAT THE UNION WAS FOR WHITES ONLY .
To give JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE AN EXAMPLE we had AN ASBESTOS CASE THAT WENT ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS .
One of the union officials that signed on to AN ASBESTOS CASE THAT WENT ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS was white , extremely racist .
When THE GOVERNMENT finally settled AN ASBESTOS CASE THAT WENT ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS HE was THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THEY ARE MISTREATING YOU IN THIS LABORATORY that A FEW WHITES THAT FELT THAT THE UNION WAS FOR WHITES ONLY called in to negotiate the settlement for VETERANS AFFAIRS employees .
HE went in and got A SETTLEMENT only for WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING .
THE GOVERNMENT , being the way that WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING were , WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING knew that WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING was n't right .
WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING accepted that as A SETTLEMENT for OUR asbestos case .
WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING knew that a handful of THOSE WHITE MEN were not the only ones that had been exposed to asbestos .
WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING took WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING and closed AN ASBESTOS CASE THAT WENT ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS out .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS left OUR were still trying to reopen AN ASBESTOS CASE THAT WENT ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS .
For THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM , most of WHITE MALES THAT WORKED IN ENGINEERING - .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS tell JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE this .
One reason OUR had MANY WHITES THAT ACCEPTED BLACKS REAL WELL was that a lot of THOSE WHITE MEN especially were THAT PEOPLE from up THE NORTH .
Met THEIR WIVES either in THE MILITARY or while THEIR WIVES were on duty at one of the military bases in THE SOUTH and married and moved south .
Even with THE WHITE FEMALES , many of THE WHITE FEMALES were THE WHITES .
THE WHITE FEMALES were THE ONES THAT WERE EDUCATIONALLY SEEKING MORE STUDENTS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BLACK .
Alabama 's A RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE .
THE WHITE FEMALES fight tooth and nails to keep YOUR UNION ACTIVITY down in A RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE .
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM came in and as THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM migrated south THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM were THE ONES THAT WERE EDUCATIONALLY SEEKING MORE STUDENTS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BLACK - .
RICHARD JEFFERSON was RICHARD JEFFERSON that THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM fired because of RICHARD JEFFERSON union activity .
RICHARD JEFFERSON was one of first people , came from Pennsylvania or somewhere up north .
RICHARD JEFFERSON came from a union city where THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WAS A FIRST IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM had plants and things .
MOST PARENTS were THOSE MEMBERS OF THE UNION .
When RICHARD JEFFERSON came , whichever place RICHARD JEFFERSON came from up north , RICHARD JEFFERSON was just union oriented .
RICHARD JEFFERSON was one of the people that spearheaded the VA getting A UNION .
SARAH THUESEN 'm curious , when YOUR were involved with the union in THE LATE '70S , THE EARLY '80S , did YOUR see THIS as an extension as YOUR civil rights activism or by THAT TIME WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST JOBS did YOUR think THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT was over ?
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT will never be over .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS always told THIS , because THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS , that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS union involvement was because of injustice , did n't matter who THE '60S was being done to .
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT had taught us that any injustice , if THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 's happening to JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE , if THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't speak up about THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , eventually THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 's going to come to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got to realize even in the workplace JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had racial issues .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had issues with FEMALES because MANY OF THE MANAGERS were male .
There were women-oriented issues also that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had to fight .
JUST ONE OF THE CATEGORIES THAT CAME UNDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT was JUST ONE OF THE CATEGORIES THAT CAME UNDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
Even though THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY is what helped motivate the Civil Rights Movement when JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE look at A. Philip Randolph in MANY OF THE MANAGERS battle with the porters on the railroad train , the trains , and things of THAT NATURE .
THE UNION , IN ITS OWN WAY was A PART OF THE MOVEMENT together .
Even now , as AN ELECTED OFFICIAL , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS try to explain to THAT PEOPLE .
Even though MY CONCENTRATION , most times , is centered around BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES , because THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS see the hands of the clock being turned back and many of OUR BLACK ELECTED OFFICIALS have just painted BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES in this closed room where BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES ca n't see MY CONCENTRATION .
BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES just say , `` Well , oh MY CONCENTRATION 's because of this .
MY CONCENTRATION 's because of MY CONCENTRATION . ''
BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES 've adopted some of THE THEORIES THAT WERE PUT OUT DURING JIM CROW ERA .
What theories are referring to ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm referring to THE FACT that , `` MOST BLACKS are lazy . ''
When JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE look at THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING , prior to THE DEPRESSION who did all THE PAPER WORK ? THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS say THE PAPER WORK 's black and white .
When MOST BLACKS want to bring THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING out and tell THE TRUTH about what was happening in THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING ? Then after THE DEPRESSION the scope of THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING changed where more whites had to be put into the work force .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE went through hundreds of years of slavery where MOST BLACKS just sat on MOST BLACKS front porch , under the veranda or SOME PLACE WHILE WE DID THE HARD WORK .
A lot of PEOPLE HAVE BOUGHT INTO THE ONLY REASON THAT BLACK PERSON HAS N'T ACHIEVED is because PEOPLE HAVE BOUGHT INTO THE ONLY REASON THAT BLACK PERSON HAS N'T ACHIEVED do n't want to achieve .
Nobody , even when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS , it was hard to get the superintendent and other school board members to understand .
For instance , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to A SCHOOL one day .
ANGELA FINLEY came to A SCHOOL .
Automatically THE ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL sent HER HOME .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` Why are JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE sending HER HOME ? JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have n't even learned why THE ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL was late . ''
HER HOME turned out with THAT YOUNG LADY HER SISTER WAS PREGNANT , went into labor that THE NIGHT BEFORE WE , THE NIGHT BEFORE WE before .
MOST PARENTS refused to go to THE TUSKEGEE VA HOSPITAL .
So THAT YOUNG LADY HER SISTER WAS PREGNANT went .
MY SISTER delivered by THE OTHER FOUR or FIVE that ONE MORNING .
MY SISTER stayed there until everything was okay , got a cab , went home , took a bath , changed clothes , came to school .
Now JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE going to punish MY SISTER ? MY SISTER did have the will to come to school .
Right .
But JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are going to send MY SISTER back home for some unspecified number of days and say , `` Oh MY SISTER 's just being lazy and shiftless .
MY SISTER do n't want EDUCATION . ''
Never checked out A STORY .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE hear A STORY now MANY TIMES , THEY 'll say , `` The reason WE got Mexicans coming in is because THEY are doing THE JOBS THAT BLACKS DO N'T WANT . ''
Tell THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THE JOB that A BLACK PERSON do n't want .
WE got BLACK MEN RIDING AROUND HERE WITH LAWN MOWERS IN THE BACK OF THEY CAR SO THEY CAN MOW SOMEBODY 'S LAWN .
WE got BLACK MEN RIDING AROUND HERE WITH LAWN MOWERS IN THE BACK OF THEY CAR SO THEY CAN MOW SOMEBODY 'S LAWN around THE RECORD WHERE THE PATIENT HAD A REACTION with ladders strapped to car to find somebody who want BLACK MEN RIDING AROUND HERE WITH LAWN MOWERS IN THE BACK OF THEY CAR SO THEY CAN MOW SOMEBODY 'S LAWN to paint THE WHITE HOUSE .
So tell THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THE JOBS THAT BLACKS DO N'T WANT .
THE ONLY JOB THAT I SEE THAT NOBODY WOULD WANT is that if JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE take THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS into a job-and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've seen THIS happen in Birmingham-where THIS 'll tell a black person THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS can only - .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS know minimum wage is five dollars and whatever but THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS can only pay JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE four dollars .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS can get some Mexicans that 'll do THE ONLY JOB THAT I SEE THAT NOBODY WOULD WANT for three dollars .
THE ONLY JOB THAT I SEE THAT NOBODY WOULD WANT 's like THIS had A GUY ON TV YESTERDAY THE EVENING .
A GUY ON TV YESTERDAY said THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm working A JOB trying to make do , earning five dollars AN HOUR .
The apartment that ME AND MY FAMILY live in is $ 400 a month .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got to have transportation to get to THE ONLY JOB THAT I SEE THAT NOBODY WOULD WANT .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't even earn enough money in a day to buy the gas to go in MY CAR , to go to THE JOB , so how do JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE expect THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS to be able to pay high utilities , high gas for MY CAR , high gas to cook and heat in THE WHITE HOUSE , and then pay THE RENT or the house note , then buy food .
We bending to that `` Oh ME AND MY FAMILY do n't want to work . ''
THE ONLY JOB PEOPLE DO N'T WANT , if THE ONLY JOB PEOPLE DO N'T WANT 's going to take THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS more money to get to THE JOB and at the end of the day THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't have any money to take care of YOUR FAMILY , YOUR FAMILY 's THE ONLY JOB PEOPLE DO N'T WANT .
YOUR were saying YOUR 've been A LITTLE disillusioned by SOME BLACK OFFICIALS promoting THE THEORIES THAT WERE PUT OUT DURING JIM CROW ERA ?
MAYBE SOME OF US have bought into that concept .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS take MAYBE SOME OF US to be in some cases SOME BLACK OFFICIALS are out of touch with SOME BLACK OFFICIALS communities .
What happens when JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE become AN ELECTED OFFICIAL ? Same thing that happened to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to THE VA HOSPITAL and THE FIRST WHITE PERSON came up to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and say , AN ELECTED OFFICIAL different from the rest of SOME BLACK OFFICIALS . ''
How am THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS different ? JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE get into a whole new world being elected official .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE see everything different .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have the opportunity to go to places MAYBE SOME OF US have never been before and exposed to different thing .
Then somewhere along the line somebody convince JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE that maybe JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE need to move .
If JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE living in and inner city community like THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do , `` Well , maybe JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE need to move to A CONTROLLED COMMUNITY where THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH is better . ''
A CONTROLLED COMMUNITY 's A CONTROLLED COMMUNITY because the streets are a certain way .
Everybody is of a certain classification or professionalism .
Pretty soon JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE do n't go to that part of YOUR DISTRICT where JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 've been .
THE ELECTED OFFICIALS , EVEN NOW , A BLACK and white-I have to put accountability more on blacks for THE STRUGGLE that US AS CHILDREN IN THE STREETS FIGHTING 've gone through and THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT is what made THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT possible for US AS CHILDREN IN THE STREETS FIGHTING to get where US AS CHILDREN IN THE STREETS FIGHTING are-you realize that THOSE OF US AS CHILDREN IN THE STREETS FIGHTING were THOSE OF US AS CHILDREN IN THE STREETS FIGHTING .
Therefore US AS CHILDREN IN THE STREETS FIGHTING sacrifice so that someone whose child had a greater chance of getting a college degree or A BETTER JOB , THE YOUNG CHILDREN took the advantage of THE STRUGGLE .
MANY PEOPLE do n't even know US AS CHILDREN IN THE STREETS FIGHTING exist .
MANY PEOPLE 've completely forgotten about what happened to THE CHILDREN THAT WAS IN THE MOVEMENT .
If NO PARENT won THIS - .
For instance , one of my best friends , NO PARENT brother was one of Dr. DR. KING FIRST hired staffers .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS have to tell NO PARENT a lot of MANY TIMES , `` The reason YOUR PICTURE is in THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE here is because JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE brother was DR. KING 'S FIRST HIRED STAFFER .
DR. KING 'S FIRST HIRED STAFFER left DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM with DR. KING . ''
Who was that ?
MY NAME is REVEREND JAMES ORANGE .
DR. KING 'S FIRST HIRED STAFFER 's still big with SCLC .
Go to ALTANTA , do JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE know Reverend James ? Yeah , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS know REVEREND JAMES ORANGE because of REVEREND JAMES ORANGE relationship with DR. KING .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS hae to tell her all the time , `` ALTANTA 's why YOUR PICTURE - '' What happened to JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE classmates whose brother was not a part of THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ? Whose parents were not a part of the Movement ? Nobody knew about US , MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN .
US , MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN are just here .
MOST OF US , MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN never were able to take ADVANTAGE OF THE FREEDOMS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET AND THE CHANGES THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IN THIS COUNTRY .
Many of MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN were never able to take ADVANTAGE OF THE FREEDOMS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET AND THE CHANGES THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IN THIS COUNTRY .
What would have made ADVANTAGE OF THE FREEDOMS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET AND THE CHANGES THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IN THIS COUNTRY possible for MORE PEOPLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE VICTORIES OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ?
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED was , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS guess , THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT realized that MORE PEOPLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE VICTORIES OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT are going to have to make some concessions to BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES .
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED established A COMFORT ZONE .
To give JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS read THIS BOOK ONCE CALLED OR DEALT WITH CLARKSDALE , MISSISSIPPI .
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT 's where Epsy was from that was over agriculture for CLINTON .
THIS BOOK ONCE CALLED OR DEALT WITH CLARKSDALE , MISSISSIPPI starts with THE DEPRESSION and THIS BOOK ONCE CALLED OR DEALT WITH CLARKSDALE , MISSISSIPPI comes all the way up .
THIS BOOK ONCE CALLED OR DEALT WITH CLARKSDALE , MISSISSIPPI talks about conversations that was held with THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT .
THEY said , `` JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE know WE 've got to make some concessions to THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH .
In order for WE to do THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH WE just ca n't let any black take these positions that 'll come open because THE THREAT OF BEING FIRED BECAUSE THEIR LIVING WAS PAID FOR BY THEIR CONGREGATION could be THE THREAT OF BEING FIRED BECAUSE THEIR LIVING WAS PAID FOR BY THEIR CONGREGATION . ''
What normally THEY did was looked out in THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH to see which black person out there is more comfortable to WE .
WE 'll open THE DOORS for THE FIRST WHITE PERSON .
WE 'll let that person ride DR. GIERACH 'S COURSE as long as THEY can .
WE got to indoctrinate that person that THE OTHER BLACKS out there are going to challenge JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE .
THE OTHER BLACKS are going to be jealous of THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got to keep an eye on THE OTHER BLACKS for WE .
What THE OTHER BLACKS did - .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS could look in THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM and like THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS tell THAT PEOPLE , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm not THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
Even WE FIRST black representative from AN AREA now , JEROME TUCKER went to ALABAMA A&M UNIVERSITY .
OUR FIRST BLACK REPRESENTATIVE FROM THAT AREA 's not considered to be the norm .
THAT PEOPLE selected OUR FIRST BLACK REPRESENTATIVE FROM THAT AREA .
THAT PEOPLE was OUR FIRST BLACK REPRESENTATIVE FROM THAT AREA .
Then THE SECOND ONE TO COME OUT , Mr. SPRATT , worked in a pipe shop all SPRATT days , retired , and managed to make THE SECOND ONE TO COME OUT active with the Jefferson County Citizens Coalition .
THE SECOND ONE TO COME OUT was one of the largest and most active political organizations in A RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE , above some of the older political organizations , when DR. ARRINGTON was THE SECOND ONE TO COME OUT president and founder .
For THE FIRST WHITE PERSON , FIRST of all THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS grew up in NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I , participated in THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE can count THE ELECTED OFFICIALS , EVEN NOW , that participated in THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and came out of the area of THE ELECTED OFFICIALS , EVEN NOW particular cities or counties that was mostly black .
A lot of OUR elected officials came from what was termed the elitist black communities .
OUR BLACK ELECTED OFFICIALS were THE ONES THAT WERE EDUCATIONALLY SEEKING MORE STUDENTS IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BLACK .
`` OUR BLACK ELECTED OFFICIALS 's a good person right there .
OUR do n't feel so threatened with THE FIRST WHITE PERSON because being an elected official OUR BLACK ELECTED OFFICIALS 'll know OUR BLACK ELECTED OFFICIALS place is to sit , be quiet , nod OUR BLACK ELECTED OFFICIALS head .
When OUR tell JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to show up JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE show up . ''
Did YOUR foresee that SOME OF THESE PATTERNS would develop that YOUR 're describing , even in THE LATE '70S or were YOUR hopeful at THE TIME , LIKE I SAID , DURING THOSE DAYS WOMEN , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM , say , when DR. ARRINGTON was elected as THE MAYOR 'S ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
MANY OF US THAT WENT TO THOSE MOVEMENT MEETINGS , MANY OF US THAT SACRIFICE AND WENT TO MARCH IN THOSE PARKS AND TO DEMONSTRATE AND EVEN TO DO WHATEVER WE HAD TO DO FOR THE MOVEMENT , MANY OF US believe that if SOME OF THESE PATTERNS could turn THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING around and allow BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES to be in KEY POSITIONS , ELECTED OFFICIALS APPOINTED TO DIFFERENT BOARDS AND AGENCIES , because of SOME OF THESE PATTERNS existence in THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING , SOME OF THESE PATTERNS could show everybody that SOME OF THESE PATTERNS could do A BETTER JOB , that SOME OF THESE PATTERNS know how to treat THAT PEOPLE fairly .
MANY OF US THAT WENT TO THOSE MOVEMENT MEETINGS , MANY OF US THAT SACRIFICE AND WENT TO MARCH IN THOSE PARKS AND TO DEMONSTRATE AND EVEN TO DO WHATEVER WE HAD TO DO FOR THE MOVEMENT , MANY OF US 's what SOME OF THESE PATTERNS fought for .
SOME OF THESE PATTERNS knew to give A PERSON CREDIT if A PERSON CREDIT is due .
SOME OF THESE PATTERNS could treat JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE equally .
THE SPOKESPERSONS FOR PEOPLE RECEIVING THE BEST QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE QUANTITY OF LIFE , TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTH CARE , THE EDUCATION , ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE WERE DENIED would be THE SPOKESPERSONS FOR PEOPLE RECEIVING THE BEST QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE QUANTITY OF LIFE , TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTH CARE , THE EDUCATION , ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE WERE DENIED .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS always remember MY GRANDDADDY talking about PEOPLE RECEIVING THE BEST QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE QUANTITY OF LIFE , TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTH CARE , THE EDUCATION , ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE WERE DENIED were sharecropping and when A STAY-AT-HOME MOM got sick the only thing THE WHITES said was , `` JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE know SOME OF THESE PATTERNS love Sally but SOME OF THESE PATTERNS can get SOME OF THESE PATTERNS another NEGRO maid . ''
MY GRANDDADDY was MY GRANDDADDY .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was sure as A CHILD 'S that if THE DOORS open up where THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS can have the opportunity to get EDUCATION , have an opportunity to come back to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS community and could see BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES as mayors .
Then SOME OF THESE PATTERNS had the commission form of government in DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM but SOME OF THESE PATTERNS changed to the MAYOR COUNCIL form .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS see blacks serving on MAYOR COUNCIL or BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES even in THE MAYOR 'S position , THE MAYOR 'S POSITION was unheard of until DR. ARRINGTON came up out of the ashes .
Then , as far as in a city like DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS always thought SOME OF THESE PATTERNS would do better , that when THE WORLD looked at THE UNITED STATES and the accomplishments of BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES in THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES would say this is THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING that SOME OF THESE PATTERNS need to emulate .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS feel now that one of the reasons that SOME OF THESE PATTERNS are not respected around THE WORLD is because THE WORLD sees SOME OF THESE PATTERNS as better than SOME OF THESE PATTERNS see SOME OF THESE PATTERNS .
There was no way that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could made THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS believe that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would see A BLACK MAYOR THAT IS REALLY NOT FOR BLACK GROWTH LIKE WE HAVE NOW IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM .
THE CITY 'S DYING and SOME OF THESE PATTERNS mayor ca n't even see THE CITY 'S DYING .
THE CITY 'S DYING 's dying .
The population is steadily dropping off .
Never could JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have told THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS that if THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS saw a black that was OUR HEAD and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS walked in to put in AN APPLICATION that that person would discriminate against THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS more than somebody that was white , would n't even allow THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS to put in AN APPLICATION .
Never would THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS have believe that if JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had a black earning X number of dollars that all of sudden PERSONNEL OR THEY felt as though OTHER BLACKS were beneath OTHER BLACKS .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS grew up , YOUR INTERNS , YOUR RESIDENTS lived in MY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE MOST PART , SOME OF THEM , if there was A BLACK DOCTOR , A BLACK DOCTOR .
And all of us was poor .
A BLACK DOCTOR house might have looked A LITTLE better but WE all were together in whatever WE were experiencing then .
There 's no way JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could have told THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS that WE mindset would be THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS could not believe .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would never have believed that WE 'd have BLACK CHILDREN THAT ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL THAT THEIR PARENTS CA N'T MANAGE THEM .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would never have believed that in THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH .
Education is the way for blacks to get out of THE SITUATION that WE 're in even though THE SEGREGATED LAWS might be changed to open THE DOORS .
THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STEP THROUGH THAT DOOR is JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have to be the best educated to go through THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STEP THROUGH THAT DOOR .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have to be THE BEST QUALIFIED .
THE BEST QUALIFIED 's what WE were taught .
WE grandparents taught WE that .
WE parents taught WE that .
YOUR PARENTS INVOLVED IN - ? JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have always got to present JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE in a fashion , that by THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STEP THROUGH THAT DOOR JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE carry JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was young and YOUR PARENTS INVOLVED IN - ? had the little civic clubs , YOUR PARENTS INVOLVED IN - ? used to teach WE how to walk , young ladies how to walk , young ladies how to dress .
WE had to put THIS BOOK ONCE CALLED OR DEALT WITH CLARKSDALE , MISSISSIPPI on WE head .
YOUR PARENTS INVOLVED IN - ? would have oratorical contests to teach JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE how to teach before a crowd .
YOUR PARENTS INVOLVED IN - ? happened in WE little communities , even though during THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA , WE commissioner , BULL CONNOR , shut those centers down so that WE would n't have a place to congregate .
WE would n't have A PLACE that WE could advance WE .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would not have thought A PLACE .
Even in THIS DAY AND TIME , A PLACE 's hard for THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS to grasp A PLACE .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS guess THIS DAY AND TIME 's why in most cases , the average elected official in A RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE , in THIS CITY , IF YOU MENTION MY NAME , she 's a renegade because THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS believe what WE fought for in the '60s can still happen .
A RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE 's just that so many things have taken up - .
The level of hopelessness that WE had then do n't even compare to this .
Now , WE are on A DIFFERENT LEVEL because-coupled with that hopelessness because of racial situation-the hopelessness now is that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've got to fight somebody that looks like THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS just talked to CHARLES STEELE , CHARLES STEELE , last week and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was telling about an incident that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had in Atlanta with Delta .
SCLC was A BLACK MAN .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS told A BLACK MAN , whether JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE want to face SCLC now and whether THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH want to face THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH , WE 're dealing with internal racism that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS equate to the same problems that THEY are having in countries like Africa where ONE TRIBE want to cleanse ONE TRIBE and kill off other blacks or in Afghanistan or any other country where JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got one group of people that say , ` WE are the pure and JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are not .
Therefore WE need to do some racial cleansing . '' ' THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS equate what WE are going through in America as a race that 's basically what WE are going through .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS believe THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT loves THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT because THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT puts THEY back in THEY comfort zone .
THEY got internal strife among WE .
When THEY killed Dr. King the whole focal point was he 's a spiritual leader .
What THEY made THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH believe , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE do n't need anybody to lead JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE .
Do YOUR see class divisions as more significant now than RACIAL ONES ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think RACIAL ONES are HAND PICKED OR SINGLED OUT and RACIAL ONES have equal footing because of blacks wanting to be accepted in what 's called a white man 's world .
RACIAL ONES have developed MORE CLASS DIVISION because of MORE CLASS DIVISION .
MORE CLASS DIVISION 's nurtured EVERYDAY WHEN WE IN SESSION by THE BIRMINGHAM NEWS .
RACIAL ONES are quick to say if you-they 'll say , `` A murder in NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I . ''
Well , NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I is anything from DOWNTOWN BIRMINGHAM going north , going northeast , northwest .
NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I 's NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I .
Where exactly did NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I happen ? NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I gets BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES to say , `` Well , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS earn a certain income and MY WHITE FRIENDS accept THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't want to be a part of NORTH BIRMINGHAM PLUS I so what THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'll do is move to an area that 's predominantly white .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'll be safe from THOSE VIOLENT NEGROES . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think THOSE VIOLENT NEGROES are HAND PICKED OR SINGLED OUT .
One wo n't be solved until the other one is solved .
What do YOUR see is THE MOST PROMISING ARENA FOR SOLVING THE LABOR MOVEMENT 'S ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think THE MOST PROMISING ARENA FOR SOLVING 's going to have to start with education FIRST .
EDUCATION FIRST because WE 're going to have to do FIRST there .
WE are going to have to redefine FAMILIES and once WE can go through an educational reform or revolution then THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think WE 've got to go through some type of revolution as far as YOUR FAMILY is YOUR FAMILY .
What do YOUR mean by redefine FAMILIES ?
FAMILIES , from A CHILD 'S PERSPECTIVE now , MOST PARENTS will go to work and FAMILIES strive to mimic acceptance .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've got to earn enough money so THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS can live in a certain neighborhood , have X number of cars , live a certain lifestyle and in the process of doing that , EVEN THOSE WORKING FAMILIES do n't have TIME , LIKE I SAID , MOST CASES WE GOT ALONG to spend with THE YOUNG CHILDREN .
EVEN THOSE WORKING FAMILIES 've been blinded by the media that say THE ONLY CHILDREN THAT ARE DOING SO AND SO are THE ONLY CHILDREN THAT ARE DOING SO AND SO .
A SINGLE FAMILY HOME could be an aunt raising a niece or A NEPHEW .
A SINGLE FAMILY HOME could be a father raising A NEPHEW children .
THE PATIENT 'S CARD 's THE PATIENT 'S CARD that THE ONLY CHILDREN THAT ARE DOING SO AND SO were dealt .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think we have to redefine FAMILIES and stop saying THE PATIENT 'S CARD 's wrong to be from a single parent household .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
MY SON is not a discipline problem .
MY SON finished college , working on MY SON masters , wife , baby .
MY SON 's still plays with MY SON friends or hang out with MY WHITE FRIENDS , no different .
Let THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS get some water .
Sure .
-LSB- RECORDER is turned off and then back on . -RSB-
YOUR were saying that YOUR 're THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
Yeah , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
-LSB- RECORDER 's just -LSB- RECORDER .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS made sure that A SINGLE PARENT I RAISED MY CHILD was actively involved in school , did HIS LAB WORK .
And A SINGLE PARENT I RAISED MY CHILD was disciplined .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think when THE BIRMINGHAM NEWS comes back and society defines - .
-LSB- interruption -RSB- Let 's see if THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got a Kleenex -
Sure .
Now we can start again .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS forgot what THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was saying .
Talking about SINGLE PARENTS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think WHEN SOCIETY CAME UP AND THEY STARTED SAYING THE ONLY CHILDREN THAT ARE DOING SO AND SO AND SO AND SO , SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLD .
Then single parent household was defined black female .
WHEN SOCIETY CAME UP AND THEY STARTED SAYING THE ONLY CHILDREN THAT ARE DOING SO AND SO AND SO AND SO , SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLD did n't encompass no other race of THAT PEOPLE .
Everything negative happened in OUR society is because of all of these BLACK FEMALES are out here having THESE BABIES and BLACK FEMALES not disciplining BLACK FEMALES .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think from THAT PERSPECTIVE WE 'VE GOT TO GO BACK AND REDEFINE FAMILIES AND TRY TO HELP FAMILIES .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've come across GRANDPARENTS , YOUNG PARENTS , WHOMEVER and WHATEVER happened and WHATEVER had to raise WHATEVER grandchildren .
Many cases , GRANDPARENTS , YOUNG PARENTS , WHOMEVER had lost some of THEIR PARENTING SKILLS .
At one point in TIME , LIKE I SAID , MOST CASES WE GOT ALONG , when THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was on the Birmingham Board of Education , OUR had a program for that OUR could help YOUNG PARENTS , WHOMEVER , YOUNG PARENTS , WHOMEVER to regain and learn THEIR PARENTING SKILLS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think that OUR just have to - .
Once OUR can get A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD back together then THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think it was corporate America that had done an awful lot to destroy OUR family values from THAT PERSPECTIVE WE 'VE GOT TO GO BACK AND REDEFINE FAMILIES AND TRY TO HELP FAMILIES .
When YOUNG PARENTS , WHOMEVER tell a family member OUR are relocating .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got to move with OUR .
If A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD 's A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD , YOUNG PARENTS , WHOMEVER both might not be able to move .
Or JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could stay here in this community for a while then OUR 'll move JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE to another community .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE did n't get the opportunity to acclimate to where JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE were to feel that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE had ownership or stability .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think corporate America destabilized family values in the process of PEOPLE TRYING TO EARN A LIVING , to provide quality of life things to YOUR FAMILY .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think OUR have to go through THE EDUCATION SYSTEM in the processes of OUR saying THE EDUCATION SYSTEM 's not kosher for white children to be in a classroom with BLACK CHILDREN THAT ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL THAT THEIR PARENTS CA N'T MANAGE THEM .
Then what OUR fall for , as far as school desegregation , was that every school system should be equal .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS question now , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE have THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS - .
When THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was in school THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was n't required to take all these standardized tests to find out where THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS am .
Now , THE YOUNG CHILDREN feel combative in THE SCHOOL SYSTEM because JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are constantly being tested to prove who JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't think THE YOUNG CHILDREN 's necessary when at THE SAME TIME and as a state legislator , I continue to ask THE QUESTION THAT I HAD TO ASK ON THOSE RECORDS , why are PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN TESTED TO DEATH ? Children in private school we do n't even know what kind of test PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN TESTED TO DEATH take , if any .
Homeschoolers are n't tested at all .
Yet , tell THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ALABAMA A&M UNIVERSITY denied that private school child or denied the homeschool .
But JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 'll deny admittance to somebody from public school because most of THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS are occupied by BLACK CHILDREN THAT ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL THAT THEIR PARENTS CA N'T MANAGE THEM , especially in THE SOUTH .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS do n't know necessarily how THE OTHER BLACKS ? make up is in other states but here JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 'll be hard pressed going through , except for one or TWO OF US of our schools in THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM , to find a white child , very hard pressed .
On CARVER HIGH SCHOOL ON THE NORTH SIDE , PARKER HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CENTER , ULLMAN HIGH SCHOOL ON THE SOUTH SIDE JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got Ramsey High School and a couple of MORE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS , yeah .
Leave there .
Go east , go west , go north .
THE EDUCATION SYSTEM has got to be corrected .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think ultimately if THE MESSAGE GIVEN FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS is different .
If JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE could see US more unified and standing up THAT EVERYBODY deserves that same opportunity regardless of where ELECTED OFFICIALS APPOINTED TO DIFFERENT BOARDS AND AGENCIES are .
US fight , the years that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've been in the legislature , on just funding THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
On one side US got REPUBLICANS and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had to fight REPUBLICANS tooth and nails on the house floor for making A STATEMENT that BLACK CHILDREN THAT ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL THAT THEIR PARENTS CA N'T MANAGE THEM do n't deserve education .
Here JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE are , people hallelujahing MY NAME because of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS , YET JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 're sitting here saying one race of THE YOUNG CHILDREN do n't deserve public school education .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think THE MESSAGE GIVEN FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS has got to change from CONGRESS .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS tell THAT PEOPLE all the time THAT PEOPLE .
CONGRESS 's below what was called the Mason and Dixie line .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE got to understand that the reason many of the JIM CROW laws existed was because of CONGRESS .
Subconsciously THAT PEOPLE still nurture that concept because instead of renewing the '65 voting rights act why did n't THAT PEOPLE say that this is something that 's a part of OUR Constitution forever .
That outcry has never come up .
That filters down to A RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE legislatures , same thing .
OUR might be present but THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS see EVERYDAY WHEN WE IN SESSION if ISSUES THAT 'S GOING TO HELP BLACKS AND POOR WHITES , OUR REPUBLICAN COUNTERPARTS PLUS WHAT I CALL A REPUBLICRATS , THOSE DEMOCRATS THAT WANT TO BE REPUBLICAN BUT THEIR DISTRICT is still A DEMOCRATIC so BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES still run for office as a Democrat .
BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES 'll kill EVERYDAY WHEN WE IN SESSION .
BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES will kill EVERYDAY WHEN WE IN SESSION .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS asked ONE , one day why is ONE JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE party claims to have a monopoly on OUR CHRISTIANITY , yet when bills are presented OUR CHRISTIANITY are going to help working CLASS PEOPLE regardless of CLASS PEOPLE color in A RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE , JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE will fight hard to kill OUR CHRISTIANITY .
JULIAN BOND told THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS , `` OUR Christianity exists outside of the walls of the state house .
When OUR come in THE RECORD WHERE THE PATIENT HAD A REACTION THE RECORD WHERE THE PATIENT HAD A REACTION do n't have nothing to do with god . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS sure wish THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had A RECORDER so THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS could tape THIS and take THIS to the radio station . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think A RECORDER 's going to be full pronged attack , A SINGLE FAMILY HOME , THE CHURCH , A SINGLE FAMILY HOME .
Above all THAT PEOPLE have got to change THE MESSAGE GIVEN FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS that THAT PEOPLE are sending out .
THE PUBLIC NEEDS to demand THE PUBLIC NEEDS .
Do YOUR think THE LABOR MOVEMENT 'S always going to have a role to play in this election ?
Always .
Because THE LABOR MOVEMENT 'S ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS ELECTION 's going to be THE OTHER BLACKS ? - .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think WE are most integrated or unified in THE LABOR MOVEMENT 'S .
SARAH THUESEN realize WE are getting close on TIME , LIKE I SAID , MOST CASES WE GOT ALONG here .
WE probably should wrap up .
How do YOUR anticipate THAT PEOPLE are going to remember THIS PERIOD in history , that is the post - '60s generation that WE 've been talking about ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think THAT PEOPLE are going to remember THIS PERIOD as a state of confusion .
There 's no hard line message or thing .
THAT PEOPLE 'll remember THE JIM CROW ERA .
THAT PEOPLE 'll remember THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA as THAT PEOPLE want to term THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA .
Then once THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA gets to THE NEXT PHASE THAT WE HAD TO FIGHT , THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think THAT PEOPLE 'll remember that THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA 's THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA .
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA 's what this is marked by .
There 's NO CLEAR MESSAGE COMING FROM ANYBODY .
Everybody 's afraid .
NO CLEAR MESSAGE COMING FROM ANYBODY 's like THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS went to the A DEMOCRATIC leadership conversation in Denver .
THAT PEOPLE were just beating around the bush on what it-the cultural aspect and role of culture in the Democratic Party .
THAT PEOPLE said everything .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS just stood up and said , `` Look here , we got to understand .
In THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING THAT PEOPLE use two phrases .
JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 're liberal or JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE 're conservative .
Be honest .
Liberal means ELSE A WHITE PERSON .
THE BUZZ WORD is THE BUZZ WORD . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS said , `` Because if THE BUZZ WORD meant anything ELSE A WHITE PERSON would n't be so fearful .
If THE BUZZ WORD meant that JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE did not go to church , well JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE made that decision JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE would n't be so fearful . ''
HISTORICALLY IN THIS COUNTRY , THE GREATEST DAMAGE OR PENALTY THAT ANY PERSON OF THE WHITE COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO PLAY is that they were penalized more when HISTORICALLY IN THIS COUNTRY , THE GREATEST DAMAGE OR PENALTY THAT ANY PERSON OF THE WHITE COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO PLAY dealt with PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT OR BLACKS from the Middle East or if HISTORICALLY IN THIS COUNTRY , THE GREATEST DAMAGE OR PENALTY THAT ANY PERSON OF THE WHITE COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO PLAY dealt with PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT OR BLACKS .
When THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS were not accepted THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS experienced MORE FEAR by joining up with THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS .
THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS 's what THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS told THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS .
At THE END OF THE MEETING THAT YOUNG LADY HER SISTER WAS PREGNANT came from Minnesota and said , `` THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm glad JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE made that A STATEMENT hit THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS right at home .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS want to get out there and be vocal about ISSUES THAT 'S GOING TO HELP BLACKS AND POOR WHITES , OUR REPUBLICAN COUNTERPARTS PLUS WHAT I CALL A REPUBLICRATS , THOSE DEMOCRATS THAT WANT TO BE REPUBLICAN BUT THEIR DISTRICT whether THE END OF THE MEETING 's dealing with THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATION WAS NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH . ''
-LRB- THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS told THAT YOUNG LADY HER SISTER WAS PREGNANT THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS got THE LABOR MOVEMENT 'S with THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS coming over illegally .
THE PRESIDENT FOR THEM did THE LABOR MOVEMENT 'S on purpose to cause CONFUSION AND FEAR . -RRB-
THAT YOUNG LADY HER SISTER WAS PREGNANT said , `` THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 'm afraid to speak up . ''
THAT YOUNG LADY HER SISTER WAS PREGNANT said , `` JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE telling THE TRUTH because when THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS say liberal to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS look at what THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've done .
The only thing that THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 've done that some other white had n't done is THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS might have more black association .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS might be speaking up more for the injustice that 's being done to THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS had BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES and whites and people of Indian descent from India .
ONE young man whose family were oriental and Asian descent , BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES came to THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS throughout THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT and BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES said , `` WE 're glad JUST ABOUT TO FALL ON YOUR FACE said that because THE THING THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT 's the truth and none of WE want to face ONE . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think that BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES are going to remember THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA as one where THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING focused more of MORE FEAR on confusion .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think BLACKS , MANY SCHOOLS FOR WHITES is by design .
THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED IT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN WASHINGTON AND THE PEOPLE IN THESE MAJOR CORPORATIONS DESIGNED THAT LEVEL OF FEAR BECAUSE WHILE WE 'RE DOING THAT WE CA N'T FOCUS ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING .
Over charging WE on gas , WE know THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA 's hurting WE but THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ca n't think about THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ERA .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ca n't think about THE FACT that THE SCHOOL SYSTEM is going down because THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED IT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN WASHINGTON AND THE PEOPLE IN THESE MAJOR CORPORATIONS DESIGNED THAT LEVEL OF FEAR BECAUSE WHILE WE 'RE DOING THAT WE CA N'T FOCUS ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING . got THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS worried about whether THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS can take a soda on a airplane or not .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think THE FACT 's what 's going to come out .
THE FACT 's like the McCartney era , during THE EARLY '50S .
PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT OR BLACKS do n't talk about much else .
When PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT OR BLACKS talk about , fear .
PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT OR BLACKS 's all PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT OR BLACKS talk about .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think PEOPLE OF CHINESE DESCENT OR BLACKS 's what WE are going to be remembered for also .
SARAH THUESEN hate to end on a pessimistic note but is there anything that YOUR wanted to talk about that SARAH THUESEN have n't brought up ?
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think WE 've covered the basic information real well .
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME .
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS appreciate JUST THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY to hear JUST THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY .
JUST THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY 's been one complaint of mine is that there is so much history for this country that needs to be uncovered so that for generations in the future somebody can look back and say , `` Oh , this might fit this puzzle .
JUST THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY 's probably one of the missing links . ''
THIS JUDGE RON MOORE THAT DID THE TEN COMMANDMENTS think if WE deal with the whole history of THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING and WE ups , WE downs , WE weaks , and WE strengths , WE can start correcting , if WE have THE OTHER BLACKS ? , that imperfection that is bringing THIS COUNTRY , WHO WAS WORKING down .
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME . again .
