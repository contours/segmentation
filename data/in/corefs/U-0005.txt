: Are WE READY TO GO ? OKAY , THIS IS TAPE NUMBER 11.19.03-JJ WITH JAMES A. JONES IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY in ROBESON COUNTY .
The interviewer is MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR , and TAPE NUMBER 11.19.03-JJ WITH JAMES A. JONES IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY 's November 19 , 2003 .
Okay .
So , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS , begin by telling WE READY TO GO ? OKAY , THIS IS TAPE NUMBER 11.19.03-JJ WITH JAMES A. JONES IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY a little bit about teaching at THE VETERAN 'S School , what THE PRINCIPAL 'S remember about THAT EXPERIENCE and THAT EXPERIENCE rewards and trials .
WE READY TO GO ? OKAY , THIS IS TAPE NUMBER 11.19.03-JJ WITH JAMES A. JONES IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY was one of my great , not the greatest probably , but one of my great moments of teaching veterans who had had the same , similar , experience in the Army as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had .
WE READY TO GO ? OKAY , THIS IS TAPE NUMBER 11.19.03-JJ WITH JAMES A. JONES IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY came back , and WE READY TO GO ? OKAY , THIS IS TAPE NUMBER 11.19.03-JJ WITH JAMES A. JONES IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY were not highly educated .
Most of WE READY TO GO ? OKAY , THIS IS TAPE NUMBER 11.19.03-JJ WITH JAMES A. JONES IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY were down in THE PRIMARY LEVEL OF EDUCATION , probably SEVENTH AND EIGHTH grade .
THE GOVERNMENT made possible for funds that were provided for TEACHERS .
TEACHERS came in , and at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME that program was held right at PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL , in the high school room , and the hours were from FOUR until NINE , five days a week .
The soldiers seemed to enjoy AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS enjoyed AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME .
During AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME WE would take A BREAK , and WE organized one of the finest volleyball teams anywhere in the district or even in ROBESON COUNTY .
WE went to other areas .
WE went down to adjoining counties and played .
WE were very , very competitive .
AN ENLIGHTENMENT was AN ENLIGHTENMENT .
THE FELLOWS would look forward to AN ENLIGHTENMENT .
THE FELLOWS were there .
Had no problem with THE FELLOWS .
Attendance was good .
The relationship was excellent .
JUST A GREAT , ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE were there for one thing , to increase THE FELLOWS education level .
JUST A GREAT , ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE was JUST A GREAT , ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE .
What kinds of STUDENTS did THE PRINCIPAL 'S have ?
All INDIAN BOYS .
All INDIAN BOYS .
Well , STUDENTS had ONE WHITE WHO LIVED IN THE AREA , and A VETERAN LIKE THE REST OF THEM name was MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR , and A VETERAN LIKE THE REST OF THEM wanted to come and be a member of THE CLASS .
A VETERAN LIKE THE REST OF THEM was A VETERAN LIKE THE REST OF THEM .
THE REST OF THEM was all Prospect related individuals .
Maybe we could talk A LITTLE BIT , ONE THING I DID N'T REALLY ASK YOU ABOUT about PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING since THE PRINCIPAL 'S were born here , grew up here , and went to school here .
How would THE PRINCIPAL 'S describe THE COMMUNITY , THAT EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW if THE PRINCIPAL 'S were talking to somebody from outside ? What would THE PRINCIPAL 'S tell them about THE COMMUNITY , THAT EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW ?
THIS is predominantly , almost a HUNDRED percent-at one time THIS was , with the exception of JUST TWO or ONLY THREE families-a NATIVE AMERICAN community , a very close knit community .
There were A LOT OF FAMILY RELATIONS , FAMILY CONNECTIONS IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
And A LOT OF FAMILY RELATIONS , FAMILY CONNECTIONS IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY 's very deep .
A LOT OF FAMILY RELATIONS , FAMILY CONNECTIONS IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY goes way back to probably the eighteenth century .
THE LAND THAT 'S IN THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY is THE LAND THAT 'S IN THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
THE LAND THAT 'S IN THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY 's just been passed down , passed down , passed down from generation to generation .
Not a lot of selling THEIR LANDS , especially to outsiders .
THE LAND THAT 'S IN THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY 's THE LAND THAT 'S IN THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY if THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 'll allow THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS to OUR that word .
OUR sometimes refer to THE LAND THAT 'S IN THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY facetiously as a little Indian reservation .
OUR like to kind of keep THE LAND THAT 'S IN THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY THAT WAY .
OUR 've got OUR prejudice feelings THESE KIDS ' TEACHER know , not really deeply imbedded , but OUR get along .
OUR 've gotten along , and OUR 're hard working , dedicated people from the farming aspects and move up the ladder on the educational level .
OUR have no qualms about OUR , and OUR feel like THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL , every one has made progress from about as long as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS can remember , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was born here eighty some years ago , right here .
Lived in THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
In fact THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've lived in THIS SPOT WHERE WE ARE TALKING RIGHT NOW SINCE 19-OH , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was eight years old probably when THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS moved here .
THIS SPOT WHERE WE ARE TALKING RIGHT NOW SINCE 19-OH was in 1930 .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've been living in this same spot since 1930 .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS attended church here in THIS SAME AREA .
MY FATHER AND MOTHER taught WE EVEN EXCHANGE .
MY FATHER AND MOTHER took WE EVEN EXCHANGE to church religiously .
Every Sunday WE EVEN EXCHANGE were in church , and WE EVEN EXCHANGE did n't give excuses .
`` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS feel bad today , '' or `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm not feeling so well .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't want to go . ''
It was understood that SUNDAY MORNING WE EVEN EXCHANGE were going to church .
SUNDAY MORNING was imbedded in WE EVEN EXCHANGE , and WE EVEN EXCHANGE still have a trickling of that in WE EVEN EXCHANGE community and in WE EVEN EXCHANGE families , and WE EVEN EXCHANGE believe in hard working , fair , honesty .
Back then WE EVEN EXCHANGE did n't have to worry about locks on the doors and THIS KIND OF THING . .
If there was A NEIGHBOR IN NEED WE EVEN EXCHANGE were ready to come to A NEIGHBOR IN NEED rescue .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS remember as A LITTLE BOY I 'D GO TO THE OTHER FAMILIES .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS take maybe a dozen of eggs and bring back some milk or vice versa .
WE EVEN EXCHANGE did WE EVEN EXCHANGE .
NOW WE EVEN EXCHANGE .
WE EVEN EXCHANGE like to go and borrow something or take something and bring back something .
This is typical Prospect community as long as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS can remember .
What makes education so important to THE PEOPLE IN PROSPECT ?
WE EVEN EXCHANGE feel PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING 's PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
WE EVEN EXCHANGE feel like MY PART 's somewhat MY PART because the greater WE EVEN EXCHANGE education , the more experiences WE EVEN EXCHANGE have , WE EVEN EXCHANGE can share that with OUR CHILDREN and motivate OUR CHILDREN to seek higher grounds .
And naturally the bottom line is financial status , upgrading , BETTER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS , BETTER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS , provide THE ELDERS with better medicine .
THE ONLY DAUGHTER passed away when THE ONLY DAUGHTER was ONLY THIRTY-NINE YEARS old with A SIMPLE GALL BLADDER .
NOW TODAY THESE KIDS ' TEACHER never hear tell of NOW TODAY .
THE ELDERS go in there and remove THESE KIDS ' TEACHER gall bladder , do whatever is necessary and A SIMPLE GALL BLADDER 's A SIMPLE GALL BLADDER .
But back then A SIMPLE GALL BLADDER was A SIMPLE GALL BLADDER , and A SIMPLE GALL BLADDER took THE ONLY DAUGHTER away at ONLY THIRTY-NINE YEARS old .
A SIMPLE GALL BLADDER was sad .
So WE felt like THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO are THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO .
With all the developing technology that WE have now , WE 've got to do something to try to stay up with THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO .
So education improves THE PRINCIPAL 'S quality of life ?
Exactly right .
YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE 's interesting though because in a lot of OTHER PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES THE PEOPLE IN PROSPECT would leave to improve YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE .
Right .
THE PEOPLE IN PROSPECT would n't stay .
Why do THE PRINCIPAL 'S think SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT ?
Because of the general environment .
SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT have a good , strong religious background .
SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT get along well .
SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT communicate well .
And THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO are THE THINGS , THE STATEMENTS I 'VE MADE .
SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT 're unity .
SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT like to practice THIS KIND OF THING . .
SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT like to talk THIS KIND OF THING . , and SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT like to practice THIS KIND OF THING . , and THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS causes us-we do n't want to leave .
SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT want to stay THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
Most of THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL do n't want to leave THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS is one of the things that merging of INDIAN SCHOOLS , and THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've already related to THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS .
SO MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE STAYED IN PROSPECT felt that THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS was not going to be good for PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING kids , and THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS 's proven that THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS 's not .
THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS 's THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS .
Maybe THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS should n't say that , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm being totally honest .
THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS 's probably THE MOST DETRIMENTAL THING THAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG KIDS .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL were taught hard work .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL were disciplined THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
STRICT-DISCIPLINE KIDS were STRICT-DISCIPLINE KIDS .
And THE COMMUNITY , THAT EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW here has always gone to school until THE ADMINISTRATOR , whoever it was that , `` Listen , if MY CHILD needs discipline , MY CHILD MY CHILD .
And when THE ADMINISTRATOR gets home THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm going to give THE ADMINISTRATOR MORE DISCIPLINE because WE ca n't allow MORE DISCIPLINE . ''
THE SCHOOL , THOSE KIDS is for education , not to go out there and get in trouble .
WE never had any problems at PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
Maybe A LITTLE BOY I 'D GO TO THE OTHER FAMILIES pulled THE GIRL 'S HAIR OR VICE versa , but something like THE GIRL 'S HAIR OR VICE .
Maybe take THE EXTENT OF THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS from A LITTLE BOY I 'D GO TO THE OTHER FAMILIES or chew chewing gum .
THE EXTENT OF THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS was probably THE EXTENT OF THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS .
And THE ONE THING that WE strive for from THE ATHLETIC SIDE , WE wanted the sportsman 's trophy for WE kids .
THE ONE THING 's THE ONE THING .
WE wanted to be victorious .
WE wanted to be the winner , but WE also wanted to show sportsmanship , and a number of years WE teams got the sportsmanship award .
WE also stress THE FACT that GOOD CITIZENS 're GOOD CITIZENS .
WE like to get the citizenship award , too , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER know .
Like one little thing , helping A NEIGHBOR IN NEED .
WE practice that .
What do THE PRINCIPAL 'S think sets PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING apart from SOME OF THE OTHER INDIAN COMMUNITIES ?
PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING 's not PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
Maybe because THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm kind of clannish THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS and live here , although THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS visit THE OTHER INDIAN SECTIONS , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS did n't mingle in SOME OF THE OTHER INDIAN COMMUNITIES .
Maybe THE OTHER INDIAN SECTIONS 's where THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS should have spread out A LITTLE BIT , ONE THING I DID N'T REALLY ASK YOU ABOUT more .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had the opportunities to go out .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was asked to go to THE OTHER INDIAN COMMUNITIES , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS never really had THE DESIRE TO .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wanted to stay here and felt like THE DESIRE TO could be more beneficial , more helpful to THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
THE BEGINNING OF OUR DAY says charity begins at home , so THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS believe in practicing this , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wanted THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL to have THE BEST HE POSSIBLY CAN .
WE strived for WE .
WE strived for WE .
What about like THE LAST TIME THE PRINCIPAL 'S were telling MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR maybe from when THE PRINCIPAL 'S were in school , but then also when THE PRINCIPAL 'S were THE PRINCIPAL 'S , THE PRINCIPAL 'S know , Union Chapel and the different types of THE THINGS , THE STATEMENTS I 'VE MADE .
What were those types of THE RIVALRIES BETWEEN PEMBROKE AND PROSPECT about ?
SPORTS was SPORTS .
WE wanted to beat PEMBROKE -RSB- , and PEMBROKE -RSB- was reciprocal , vice versa .
PEMBROKE -RSB- wanted to beat PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
They always referred to WE as THE `` UPAHEADERS . ''
WE were `` THE `` UPAHEADERS . ''
THE `` UPAHEADERS was THE `` UPAHEADERS .
WE did n't really resent that to THE EXTENT OF THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS that THE EXTENT OF THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS caused any trouble , but WE main objective was to beat PEMBROKE -RSB- .
PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL won the THE FIRST championship game that was played in the university there , in the gymnasium .
What year was that ?
Oh , WHAT THE YEAR was that ? WHAT was in 41 .
NINETEEN FORTY-ONE .
NINETEEN FORTY-ONE .
Okay .
PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING won .
PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING was PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
An Indian county tournament ?
AN INDIAN COUNTY TOURNAMENT .
Then AN INDIAN COUNTY TOURNAMENT . 's all WE played , INDIAN SCHOOLS , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER see , because EACH ON OF THE SCHOOLS were individual .
All the towns around had INDIAN SCHOOLS , like MAXTON SCHOOL .
WE did not intermingle with EACH ON OF THE SCHOOLS in SPORTS .
It was ONLY THE INDIAN SCHOOLS WHO WERE ABLE TO COMPETE AMONG THEMSELVES .
Now once in A WHILE , EACH ON OF THE SCHOOLS , WE went up to Moore County and played up in there some of ONLY THE INDIAN SCHOOLS WHO WERE ABLE TO COMPETE AMONG THEMSELVES .
INDIAN SCHOOLS or WHITE SCHOOLS ?
WHITE SCHOOLS
WE kind of A BREAK .
Mr. Carlie Lowry was instrumental in bringing about WE .
WE played Star and Bisco which is up there .
THE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WE PLAYED are THE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WE PLAYED .
Once in A WHILE WE did go down and play in Bennettsville .
WE played Bennettsville in South Carolina a couple of TIMES .
This was just in SPORTS .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR wonder when THE PRINCIPAL 'S mentioned THE VOLLEYBALL TEAM for THE VETERAN 'S School - ?
UM-HUM , RIGHT .
Who did THE VOLLEYBALL TEAM play ?
There was a school down in Bladen County , and MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR had a Veteran 's School down there .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR were doing THE SAME THING , and YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL competed against MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR .
Were YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL Indians as well ?
Yeah , MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR were Indians .
YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL 's interesting .
So even in THE VETERAN 'S School THE VETERAN 'S SCHOOL was THE VETERAN 'S SCHOOL .
Exactly right .
Describe for YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL for us when THE PRINCIPAL 'S were in school at Prospect Elementary and High School , what BETTER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS were like .
What was A NORMAL DAY FOR YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS began school out THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL in the THE FIRST grade .
YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL went to school , back then YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL had YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL opening ceremonies in YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL auditorium .
All the students came together .
YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL had AN ASSEMBLY , and AN ASSEMBLY was called a chapel program .
THE BEGINNING OF OUR DAY was read , prayer was done , and YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL said the Pledge of Allegiance , and YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL sang America the Beautiful .
THE BEGINNING OF OUR DAY was THE BEGINNING OF OUR DAY .
YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL went back to THE CLASSES , NOT ALL THE CLASSES , and then in mid-morning YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL had a fifteen-minute recess .
Then at lunchtime , twelve o'clock , YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL had no cafeterias as YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL have now .
All the kids brought THEIR LUNCH .
At lunchtime YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL had A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY , from twelve to one .
YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL 'd go outside and play whatever sport time A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY was .
A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY was either football , or A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY would be basketball , or baseball , or softball for THE GIRLS .
Then ONLY THREE o'clock YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL dismissed to come home .
A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY was A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY .
What were the relationships with TEACHERS like ?
Good , good .
THE TEACHER was there all the time .
Now , as far as THE LUNCH HOUR , LOAD THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS did not go out and organize .
WE did THE LUNCH HOUR , LOAD on WE own , and WE had THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS .
THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS were not demanded to go out .
Once in a while SOME OF THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS minded , SOME OF THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS 'd come out and watch , but SOME OF THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS really did n't do the kind of coaching that THESE KIDS ' TEACHER have going on in INDIAN SCHOOLS now .
SOME OF THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS were more or less maybe SOME OF THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS , but WE had THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS .
So SPORTS were kind of self-organized ? Is that right ?
Self-organized .
SPORTS was self-organized .
SPORTS 's interesting .
And THE TOURNAMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ?
WHITE SCHOOLS , now THE TOURNAMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT , when WE got into PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING where WE were beginning to compete on the high school level , WE did have organized .
WE did have COACHES , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was talking primarily now from the K-through-back then from THE FIRST through the EIGHTH grade .
Right .
Okay .
WE makes sense .
In PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL was organized .
WE had COACHES back then , but it was all Indians .
When WE 'd get ready to play THE WAY WE WORKED , WE 'd go play THE WAY WE WORKED during THE LUNCH HOUR , LOAD up the kids in cars , and THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS would go sometimes to take THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS to play , and THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS 'd bring THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS back during THEIR LUNCH .
THE WAY WE WORKED 's THE WAY WE WORKED .
It was all Indian schools .
Go down to FAIRGROVE , THE MAGNOLIA SECTION , THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
Go down to GREEN GROVE , FAIRGROVE , THE MAGNOLIA SECTION , THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
Go down to MAGNOLIA and WHITE SCHOOLS .
WE always had THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS there .
THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS would drive THEIR CAR and carry THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
THE PRINCIPAL 'S now , THEIR CAR 's interesting that THEIR CAR sounds like A VERY PROSPEROUS COMMUNITY , but MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR also know that a lot of THE INDIAN CHILDREN have the experience of having to stay out of school to help THEIR PARENTS on the farm and THE THINGS , THE STATEMENTS I 'VE MADE like A VERY PROSPEROUS COMMUNITY .
Right .
Could THE PRINCIPAL 'S talk A LITTLE BIT , ONE THING I DID N'T REALLY ASK YOU ABOUT about some of the economic differences in PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
Were there WEALTHIER PEOPLE and poorer people ? Was everybody sort of ABOUT THE same ? How did that work ?
WEALTHIER PEOPLE had GREATER LAND OWNERS THAT THE OTHERS , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wo n't call NAMES in THIS SITUATION .
WEALTHIER PEOPLE had a few people that was considered upper-echelon because GREATER LAND OWNERS THAT THE OTHERS were GREATER LAND OWNERS THAT THE OTHERS .
Then WEALTHIER PEOPLE had SOME WHO WERE TENANT FARMERS .
SOME WHO WERE TENANT FARMERS was difficult for TENANT FARMERS .
WEALTHIER PEOPLE had A FEW INDIAN KIDS WHO HAD TO STAY OUT OF SCHOOL UNTIL THE CROPS WERE HARVESTED IN THE FALL OF THE YEAR .
Even at one TIME SCHOOL was delayed until THE CROPS could be harvested , or A FEW INDIAN KIDS WHO HAD TO STAY OUT OF SCHOOL UNTIL THE CROPS WERE HARVESTED IN THE FALL OF THE YEAR would do a half a day .
Come to school at lunchtime or dismiss at lunch so A FEW INDIAN KIDS WHO HAD TO STAY OUT OF SCHOOL UNTIL THE CROPS WERE HARVESTED IN THE FALL OF THE YEAR could go home , and especially in harvesting THE TOBACCO in THE FALL OF THE YEAR , trying to get THE TOBACCO in .
WEALTHIER PEOPLE delayed school until WEALTHIER PEOPLE got THE TOBACCO harvested .
WEALTHIER PEOPLE considered that , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS thought at THAT PARTICULAR TIME THAT PARTICULAR TIME was THAT PARTICULAR TIME because THESE KIDS ' TEACHER were helping TENANT FARMERS , and TENANT FARMERS only livelihood and the only help TENANT FARMERS had then-they did n't have big tractors like WEALTHIER PEOPLE have now , mechanized-it was all hand done .
Cotton was picked with HIS HANDS .
With HIS HANDS , all of it until THAT PARTICULAR TIME was gathered .
Let THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS share one incident that happened when THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS .
WE AT PROSPECT needed SOME SHRUBBERY at TIME SCHOOL , and WE AT PROSPECT took THE CLASSES , NOT ALL THE CLASSES , but WE AT PROSPECT particular class .
Maybe JUST TWO or ONLY THREE classes .
WE AT PROSPECT went out in THE COMMUNITY , THAT EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW and picked cotton , and TENANT FARMERS paid WE AT PROSPECT for picking , so much per pound .
THAT MONEY was brought back to THE SCHOOL , THOSE KIDS and in turn THE PRINCIPAL 'S bought shrubbery , and WE AT PROSPECT brought THAT MONEY to THE SCHOOL , THOSE KIDS , and THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL helped plant SOME SHRUBBERY around THE SCHOOL , THOSE KIDS .
THE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WE PLAYED are the kind of THOSE THINGS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know if any other community did THE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WE PLAYED or not , but WE AT PROSPECT did THE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WE PLAYED .
Right .
THAT MONEY was coming from ROBESON COUNTY ?
THAT MONEY was coming from the county for shrubbery , beautification .
THAT MONEY was all school - related activities .
THAT MONEY helps us transition a little bit then to THE PRINCIPAL 'S experience of THE SCHOOL SYSTEM and how THE SCHOOL SYSTEM worked in let 'S say THE 50S , LATE 50S .
If THE PRINCIPAL 'S could start then .
If THE PRINCIPAL 'S maybe would talk a little bit about the school committees , and what kind of relationship THE SCHOOL , THOSE KIDS and THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE , and then THE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD had .
The best THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS can recall THIS , THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT made THE FINAL DECISION , but each school had what THIS called A LOCAL COMMITTEE , and A LOCAL COMMITTEE screened THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS , and THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS were somewhat very , very rigid .
At THAT ONE TIME , THIS were not allowed to teach school .
If A TEACHER 'S got pregnant , THAT ONE TIME was THAT ONE TIME , right then and there .
A TEACHER 'S did n't teach any longer .
SOME OF THOSE THINGS were very , very rigorous .
Sometimes THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think SOME OF THOSE THINGS made a lot of GOOD DECISIONS , but sometimes THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wondered about SOME OF THE DECISIONS that SOME OF THE DECISIONS made .
Give SOME OF THOSE THINGS an example of a good one and a not so good one .
Okay .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wo n't call A NAME IN THIS SITUATION .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS remember AN EXCELLENT TEACHER , AN EXCELLENT TEACHER was AN EXCELLENT TEACHER , and AN EXCELLENT TEACHER was married , and AN EXCELLENT TEACHER got pregnant during AN EXCELLENT TEACHER marriage which is a normal thing .
THEY found out that AN EXCELLENT TEACHER was pregnant .
THEY dismissed AN EXCELLENT TEACHER immediately from teaching school .
If THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd call AN EXCELLENT TEACHER name now THESE KIDS ' TEACHER would know , and YOUR DADDY would know , and A NAME IN THIS SITUATION would get back to everybody .
We thought THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED was awful , because AN EXCELLENT TEACHER was one of the better teachers in the school system at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME .
But THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED 's THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED was devastating .
Was there any way , could anybody have appealed THE FINAL DECISION ?
Well , THE FINAL DECISION was THE FINAL DECISION , and A LOCAL COMMITTEE made THE FINAL DECISION and THEY abided by A LOCAL COMMITTEE .
THEY may have talked about THE FINAL DECISION , but there was nothing ever put in concrete to eliminate THE FINAL DECISION .
Finally , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER know , THE FINAL DECISION elevated from THE FINAL DECISION and THEY did away with A LOCAL COMMITTEE , and then THE BOARD OF EDUCATION came in and started to take over , and THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT , and THE PRINCIPAL 'S made recommendations and then THE BOARD OF EDUCATION put the final approval on THE BOARD OF EDUCATION and THIS KIND OF THING . .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THE FINAL DECISION kind of helped A LOT .
THE FINAL DECISION was more fair , maybe ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
Why did THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE have so much power ?
PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING 's PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS did n't really get into PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING back then , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know .
PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING looked like THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL were just THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL from that political standpoint , and THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL were very domineering .
THE WAY THEY OBSERVED THINGS , AND THEIR DEEP FEELINGS , and THE WAY THEY OBSERVED THINGS , AND THEIR DEEP FEELINGS , were so powerful .
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL were just so powerful that nobody would really revoke any of those situations .
Once in a while THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL would , but most times , `` THE WAY THEY OBSERVED THINGS , AND THEIR DEEP FEELINGS 's THE WAY THEY OBSERVED THINGS , AND THEIR DEEP FEELINGS THE WAY THEY OBSERVED THINGS , AND THEIR DEEP FEELINGS is .
Okay . ''
And THE COMMUNITY , THAT EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW knew that , and THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL kindly abided by THOSE THINGS .
If A LADY got pregnant A LADY 'd keep that concealed as long as A LADY possibly could , because THIS was of concern back then .
THIS was n't like THIS is now where THE PEOPLE IN PROSPECT can just work all the way through .
THIS 's right .
Work all the way through , THIS 's right .
And maybe go and stay out SIX WEEKS , something like SIX WEEKS , and come right back in .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR wonder , were the members of THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE connected to the church as well ? Was there an interrelationship ?
Not necessarily .
Okay .
Some of MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR were .
SOME were not .
But SOME were widespread .
It was n't like WE have now , districts or anything like WE , but it was just CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO WERE SELECTED TO SERVE .
Go back again and tell WE who selected CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO WERE SELECTED TO SERVE .
Well , usually THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT had SOME INPUT and THE PRINCIPAL 'S was very instrumental , and said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd like for Mr. Joe , '' or `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd like for Sister Mary to be A SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEMBER , '' A SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEMBER .
Okay .
But MOST TIMES , believe MOST TIMES or not , most times it was men , very seldom the ladies had any voice .
THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED 's THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED .
THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED 's THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED .
What about deciding , in the case of INDIAN SCHOOLS ? Did THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE have any say-so over A PARTICULAR SCHOOL ?
Very little .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER know , MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS really am not sure when THE DISTRICT LINES were drawn up .
It was just understood that all of the Prospect people , THE INDIANS THAT WERE LIVING IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY went to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
Usually that A NATURAL BOUNDARY was A NATURAL BOUNDARY .
A NATURAL BOUNDARY was A NATURAL BOUNDARY .
Then THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN went there .
JESSE OXENDINE , YOU KNOW MY COUSIN lived in THIS SAME AREA , CHEROKEE , THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES went to Cherokee School .
And THE SAME THING was so in MAGNOLIA , down in FAIRMONT DISTRICT , down in GREEN GROVE , FAIRGROVE , THE MAGNOLIA SECTION , THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
THE SAME THING was THE SAME THING to the best of MY KNOWLEDGE before any real district lines were drawn up like THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL are now .
Right .
Well , THE SAME THING 's just interesting to note for people who are n't from THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
Right .
To really know .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR know THE SAME THING 's hard because THE PRINCIPAL 'S 've been in the middle of THE SAME THING , but if THE PRINCIPAL 'S could just tell us a little bit about how THE PEOPLE IN PROSPECT knew .
What was THE WAY THEY OBSERVED THINGS , AND THEIR DEEP FEELINGS ? How would THE PRINCIPAL 'S , for example , know whether someone belonged to THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY ?
Where HE resided in HE home .
Where HE lived .
If HE lived in THIS SAME AREA , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS knew HE was supposed to go to Pembroke School .
If HE lived in THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY like up here to THE RED HILL area , all those students WE knew THEY were coming .
Over to the Philadelphus area-and by THE WAY THEY OBSERVED THINGS , AND THEIR DEEP FEELINGS , THE WAY THEY OBSERVED THINGS , AND THEIR DEEP FEELINGS 's one THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS did n't even mention .
PHILADELPHUS had A LITTLE SCHOOL SYSTEM OVER THERE , and A LITTLE SCHOOL SYSTEM OVER THERE was white , and WE did n't have any operation with THEY whatsoever .
And all the kids around THE BUIE SECTION , WE did n't have any kids out of there .
THEY had THEY own school over there , and THEIR OWN SCHOOL OVER THERE was all white .
WE did n't have MANY KIDS LIVING OUT IN THESE OUTLYING AREAS .
Once in a while a family lived there , but MANY KIDS LIVING OUT IN THESE OUTLYING AREAS 'd have to make MANY KIDS LIVING OUT IN THESE OUTLYING AREAS way .
WE had THE BUSES GO THROUGH , and THE BUSES GO THROUGH only picked up THE INDIAN CHILDREN and brought THE INDIAN CHILDREN to the Indiana school .
THE WHITES picked up the white kids and took THE WHITES to the white school .
Fortunately , WE had ONE black family as long as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS can remember lived less than JUST TWO miles up the road up here at the old RED SPRINGS road , and THE BUS came from RED SPRINGS and got THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN , and took THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN over there as long as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS can remember .
WE 's THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED .
THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED 's interesting because a lot of what WE 're trying to figure out with this project is how that segregation system was enforced , because it seems so easy in some ways to be able to cross THE DISTRICT LINES depending on THE PRINCIPAL 'S circumstances , but THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED sounds like in THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED was n't THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED .
WHITE SCHOOLS , THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED was n't .
Now , when WE really had THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED was when THEY drew up THE DISTRICT LINES , and THE DISTRICT LINES was about THE TIME WHEN WE HAD ELIMINATED ALL OF THE CITY UNIT , maybe '70S , WHEN THEY DREW THE MAXTON LINE UP THERE .
Right there about '70S , WHEN THEY DREW THE MAXTON LINE UP THERE , and THEY came all the way out to THAT RED HILL ROAD .
At THAT RED HILL ROAD , let 'S say the east side , THE KIDS ON THIS SIDE came to PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING and JESSE OXENDINE , YOU KNOW MY COUSIN schools .
THAT RED HILL ROAD was THE INDIANS THAT WERE LIVING IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
THE KIDS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THAT RED HILL ROAD , THE KIDS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THAT RED HILL ROAD had to go to MAXTON , THE WHOLE CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM .
THE KIDS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THAT RED HILL ROAD 's when we really had A LITTLE WAR SO TO SPEAK , A LITTLE WAR SO TO SPEAK .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL , THEIR PARENTS resented A LITTLE WAR SO TO SPEAK .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS went to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS children 's going to Prospect School . ''
We even had a little conflict with Oxendine students in PROSPECT-THE PARENTS , not the students , but PROSPECT-THE PARENTS .
The parent says , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS went to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS children 's going . ''
And MY CHILDREN 'S GOING TO PROSPECT SCHOOL . '' were really living in the Oxendine School District .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS remember when THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS became principal the superintendent asked US to go out and talk to PROSPECT-THE PARENTS , and US did , THE PRINCIPAL OF OXENDINE SCHOOL AND MYSELF .
US went out and talked to PROSPECT-THE PARENTS .
PROSPECT-THE PARENTS told US POINT BLANK , `` US 're not going to OXENDINE SCHOOL THAT CAME TO PROSPECT .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS went to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS children are going to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
MY GRANDCHILDREN are going , '' and MY GRANDCHILDREN 's how dynamic MY GRANDCHILDREN were .
And PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL happened until eventually PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL went to court and finally got PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL established .
Still , just recently , the last couple of ONLY THIRTY-NINE YEARS 've reorganized .
LAST YEAR , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think , MY GRANDCHILDREN redistricted .
LAST YEAR took effect LAST YEAR , and LAST YEAR 's going to take effect , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS understand , THIS SCHOOL YEAR even more than THIS SCHOOL YEAR did because THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got an influx especially of OXENDINE SCHOOL THAT CAME TO PROSPECT .
RED SPRINGS SCHOOL came and got A FEW INDIAN KIDS WHO HAD TO STAY OUT OF SCHOOL UNTIL THE CROPS WERE HARVESTED IN THE FALL OF THE YEAR within , well , right beside THE SCHOOL , THOSE KIDS .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER know the Oxendine School Road ? Okay , RED SPRINGS SCHOOL DISTRICT went to THE SCHOOL PROPERTY LINE , dropped behind THE SCHOOL PROPERTY LINE , came back and joined that right above THE SCHOOL PROPERTY LINE , and everything from THERE WEST that was RED SPRINGS .
And THERE WEST was as close to THE SCHOOL , THOSE KIDS , as from THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL to A QUARTER OF A MILE , A QUARTER OF A MILE .
THERE WEST had to go to RED SPRINGS .
Now THERE WEST was awful .
THERE WEST was awful .
What was THE WAY THE SET UP THE DISTRICT LINES ?
THE WAY THE SET UP THE DISTRICT LINES 's THE WAY THE SET UP THE DISTRICT LINES .
Yeah ? Why do THE PRINCIPAL 'S reckon ABOUT THE set ABOUT THE up THAT WAY ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS guess ABOUT THE wanted to keep THE ENROLLMENT OF THEIR SCHOOL up , and THEIR OWN SCHOOL OVER THERE 's THEIR OWN SCHOOL OVER THERE .
THE ENROLLMENT OF THEIR SCHOOL caused SO MUCH HARD FEELINGS .
The Indians wanting to come-they did n't want to go to RED SPRINGS , but ABOUT THE were just about forced to go to RED SPRINGS .
As THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was telling THESE KIDS ' TEACHER earlier , THE SAME THING was true with Oxendine .
ABOUT THE did n't want to go to JESSE OXENDINE , YOU KNOW MY COUSIN .
ABOUT THE wanted to go to PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING because ABOUT THE parents had .
THE KIND OF THING-IT WAS NOT AN EASY BATTLE is THE KIND OF THING-IT WAS NOT AN EASY BATTLE .
THE KIND OF THING-IT WAS NOT AN EASY BATTLE was not AN EASY BATTLE , but eventually THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THE KIND OF THING-IT WAS NOT AN EASY BATTLE 's somewhat resolved .
But now ABOUT THE 've reopened because of the educational levels and federal compliances , and state compliances .
If `` X '' SCHOOL is not doing AS WELL AS `` B '' SCHOOL , OR `` Y '' SCHOOL , THEN ABOUT THE have given PROSPECT-THE PARENTS THE PREROGATIVE , `` Well , if THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're not satisfied , '' and THE PREROGATIVE 's happened LAST YEAR THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS understand , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've been told that , `` If THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're not satisfied with THESE KIDS ' TEACHER child going to AS WELL AS `` B '' SCHOOL , OR `` Y '' SCHOOL , THEN , and THESE KIDS ' TEACHER want to put YOUR CHILD GOING TO `` Y '' SCHOOL in `` X '' SCHOOL , come down and we 'll arrange `` X '' SCHOOL , and put YOUR CHILD GOING TO `` Y '' SCHOOL over there . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know whether `` X '' SCHOOL 's `` X '' SCHOOL .
Maybe some .
But then that creates A LOT OF ANIMOSITY .
Right .
Right .
A LOT OF ANIMOSITY does .
Well MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR know that there was A TIME IN THE 50S , LATE 50S and EARLY 60S where THE PEOPLE IN PROSPECT were doing THE 50S , LATE 50S .
Right .
EARLY 60S were deciding not to go to INDIAN SCHOOLS EARLY 60S had been assigned to .
Tell US about MAYBE THAT PERIOD OF TIME .
Now , US had US .
US had JUST A FEW .
There again , US 's where a big law suit came about when US happened .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't mind telling THESE KIDS ' TEACHER .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had a classroom full of THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
Back then US had trailers .
US had A CLASSROOM OF ABOUT THIRTY-SOME KIDS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO OXENDINE SCHOOL .
THIRTY-SOME KIDS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO OXENDINE SCHOOL parent 'S says , `` US 're not going to let THIRTY-SOME KIDS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO OXENDINE SCHOOL go there .
THIRTY-SOME KIDS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO OXENDINE SCHOOL 're going to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL . ''
Now , US could n't keep THIRTY-SOME KIDS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO OXENDINE SCHOOL off THE BUS , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS .
So 72 was 72 ?
Seventy-two .
Okay .
Okay , THE BUS picked THEM up , brought THEM to school .
THEM went to the cafeteria like all the other students , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS could not enroll THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN in PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS could not give THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN BOOKS .
If THESE KIDS ' TEACHER want to enroll THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're not going to get BOOKS .
Did not furnish a teacher for THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN .
THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN sat there THERE A WHOLE YEAR , and THE ONLY INSTRUCTION THEY GOT , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS took THE ONLY INSTRUCTION THEY GOT on MY PART .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm not going to let THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN stay THERE A WHOLE YEAR without some kind of guidance . ''
Could n't get BOOKS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS got A LETTER from THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT specifically spelling THE LETTER FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT out , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told PROSPECT-THE PARENTS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS read A LETTER to THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
It was the sixth , SEVENTH AND EIGHTH , AND EIGHTH grade kids .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS says , `` Now , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER BOYS AND GIRLS understand THE LETTER FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT is THE LETTER FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS must abide by what THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT says , or otherwise THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wo n't have a job .
BOYS AND GIRLS 's how important THE LETTER FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT is .
Now , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER either do THE LETTER FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT or THESE KIDS ' TEACHER get out . ''
So THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS read THE LETTER FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT to BOYS AND GIRLS , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told BOYS AND GIRLS that BOYS AND GIRLS had all the other privileges that any other kid had there .
BOYS AND GIRLS went out and played .
So THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS brought in A TEACHER 'S aide .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS assigned A TEACHER 'S aide to A CLASSROOM OF ABOUT THIRTY-SOME KIDS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO OXENDINE SCHOOL .
A TEACHER 'S stayed there THERE A WHOLE YEAR .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` Take THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL to the library .
Film projectors .
Film strips .
Library BOOKS .
Use them .
However THESE KIDS ' TEACHER see the interest of THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL , and THESE KIDS ' TEACHER keep THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL moving .
Keep THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL going . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL 're not going to run all over THE CAMPUS .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL 're going to operate just like ANOTHER CLASS .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're THESE KIDS ' TEACHER , and THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got to carry THIS out , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS expect THESE KIDS ' TEACHER to carry THIS out .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're THE TEACHER , not on paper as far as THE BOARD OF EDUCATION , but THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're THESE KIDS ' TEACHER , and THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're THESE KIDS ' TEACHER , so THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS expect THESE KIDS ' TEACHER to carry PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING out and be THE TEACHER . ''
We got along with THE BOARD OF EDUCATION .
How many kids ?
THIRTY-SOME kids .
Okay .
And THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO are PARENTS THAT LIVED ON THE WEST SIDE OF RED HILL ROAD ?
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO 's exactly right .
In fact , PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE lived THE ATHLETIC SIDE , and PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE were supposed to go to OXENDINE SCHOOL THAT CAME TO PROSPECT , but PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE resented THE ATHLETIC SIDE .
PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE 're PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE . ''
But JESSE OXENDINE , YOU KNOW MY COUSIN was an Indian school ?
Oh , definitely , but just because TRADITION , THAT THEY went to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
Sometimes TRADITION , THAT THEY 's hard to break PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER know , Indian traditions are tough .
PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE were tough .
It was n't always easy to deal with .
How did THIS SITUATION get resolved ?
PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE went to THE BOARD OF EDUCATION and PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE had a law suit .
PARENTS SAID , `` I 'M NOT GOING THERE had a law suit about THE BOARD OF EDUCATION , and finally SOME OF THOSE PARENTS-AND THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS talked with SOME OF THOSE PARENTS-AND so much .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're hurting NOBODY BUT YOUR CHILD AND YOUR GRANDCHILD .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're depriving that child of AN EDUCATION .
Go on to OXENDINE SCHOOL THAT CAME TO PROSPECT because OXENDINE SCHOOL THAT CAME TO PROSPECT is OXENDINE SCHOOL THAT CAME TO PROSPECT .
Let NOBODY BUT YOUR CHILD AND YOUR GRANDCHILD go there until THE SEVENTH GRADE or EIGHTH grade , NOBODY BUT YOUR CHILD AND YOUR GRANDCHILD 're coming on to PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're not getting any education for NOBODY BUT YOUR CHILD AND YOUR GRANDCHILD . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're hurting NOBODY BUT YOU AND YOUR CHILD . ''
So , NOBODY BUT YOU AND YOUR CHILD gradually -LSB- unclear -RSB- in , and THE SEVENTH GRADE evolved .
So NOBODY BUT YOU AND YOUR CHILD sort of accepted THE SEVENTH GRADE over A TIME IN THE 50S , LATE 50S ?
Yeah , NOBODY BUT YOU AND YOUR CHILD finally accepted .
To what extent , because MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR know that THIS was at the same time that THE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD was trying to send THE BLACKS to PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING , so were those JUST TWO issues related ?
WHITE SCHOOLS , not at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR were not .
Now , THIS had at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told THESE KIDS ' TEACHER this before , AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME was not AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME , and about FOUR or FIVE ONE WHITE WHO LIVED IN THE AREA was coming at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME .
THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE was not interwoven or related anything to THE BLACKS or THE WHITES .
THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE did n't really happen until THE BLACKS brought ABOUT THE greater district areas and began to force THE INTEGRATION .
THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE 's when THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE developed , when THE BLACKS started forcing .
Let THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE talk about MAYBE THAT PERIOD OF TIME then .
About WHAT THE YEAR then are THE BLACKS ?
WHAT had to be in the seventy-let 's see , 64 , 65 , 66-That was in THE 70S when THE 70S really evolved .
Okay .
And THE WHITES did n't want to come .
WE had some whites from JESSE OXENDINE , YOU KNOW MY COUSIN .
WE had some whites from THE PHILADELPHUS AREA over there , in THE BUIE SECTION there .
THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN , THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN came to school here because THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN drew THE DISTRICT LINES , and THE PHILADELPHUS AREA so happened THE PHILADELPHUS AREA went out THAT WAY and brought THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN .
But THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN was n't near as bad as later when things really-they began to put all force on , and THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got to adhere to THE DISTRICT LINES .
THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN 's when THE BOARD OF EDUCATION really got THE BOARD OF EDUCATION , and THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN said to INDIAN SCHOOLS , `` THESE KIDS ' TEACHER shall not , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER will not enroll a kid outside of THESE KIDS ' TEACHER school district . ''
THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN 's when THE BOARD OF EDUCATION really came to the surface , and PROSPECT-THE PARENTS then had to go down to THE BOARD OF EDUCATION and deal with PROSPECT-THE PARENTS .
-LSB- unclear -RSB- .
-LSB- had GUIDELINES . , and PARENTS THAT LIVED ON THE WEST SIDE OF RED HILL ROAD knew .
GUIDELINES .
`` WE ca n't go to THE PRINCIPAL 'S now .
It 's out of HIS HANDS .
WE 've got to go to THE BOARD OF EDUCATION . ''
WE 's when they had the ruckus with THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL , and THE BOARD OF EDUCATION had to deal with THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL , and the individual schools did n't have to do nothing .
Now THE LAST TIME WE were talking about MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL and YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES - Why do n't WE talk for a minute about THE PRINCIPAL 'S working relationship with DANFORD when DANFORD was principal during EARLY 60S , and then moving into the circumstances around DANFORD resignation and THE PRINCIPAL 'S taking over , mostly that story that THE PRINCIPAL 'S told MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR THE LAST TIME .
Oh , yes .
This was when THE INTEGRATION began to bloom so to speak .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was assistant principal .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL was MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL .
THAT PARTICULAR TIME was in THE 70S .
The Indian people of PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING community resented strongly having any black students to come to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL being the principal made A COMMITMENT , and THE FINAL DECISION was THE FINAL DECISION , and A COMMITMENT was even after the Federal Government decision on integrating , ' 64 .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL said , `` Do n't THESE KIDS ' TEACHER worry .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm not going to have any Black kids come to PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
They 're not coming . ''
Well , MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL and DANFORD was always superb .
DANFORD was MY SUPERIOR , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was loyal to MY SUPERIOR , and DANFORD knew that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS supported DANFORD .
But DANFORD and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS , one-on-one , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL , '' THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT is THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT now .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't believe that OUR 're going to be able , '' and DANFORD just point POINT BLANK told THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS .
DANFORD said , `` Yes , THEY 're not coming here as long as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm THE PRINCIPAL 'S . ''
Well , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS still had to be loyal to DANFORD .
DANFORD was THE PRINCIPAL 'S .
DANFORD made GOOD DECISIONS , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had to go along with THEY , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS did n't resent it .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` Okay , THE FINAL DECISION 's THE FINAL DECISION , '' but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm afraid THE FINAL DECISION might not .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER may have some problems coming back . ''
So THE FINAL DECISION really surfaced NOW WE EVEN EXCHANGE . .
THE FINAL DECISION really surfaced , opened in the fall of ' 71 .
THEY came , YOUR DESIGNATED SCHOOL enforcement , and THEY had heard what was going to happen .
THE BLACK 'S has got to come .
THE GOVERNMENT says THEY 've got to come .
The state says THEY 've got to come .
ROBESON COUNTY says THEY 've got to come .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL , says , `` THEY 're not coming . ''
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB-
But anyway , -LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- surfaced .
THAT SEPTEMBER MORNING-I believe THAT SEPTEMBER MORNING-I was September , but anyway of 71 , and YOUR DESIGNATED SCHOOL was here .
THE TROOPERS was THE TROOPERS , all waiting , well from THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS -LSB- Moore 's -RSB- station all the way back the other way , and the streets were lined .
We got to school SUNDAY MORNING , and everybody THE TROOPERS came .
SOME OF THE BLACKS came .
SOME OF THE BLACKS did n't want to come .
SOME OF THE BLACKS did n't want to come , but YOUR DESIGNATED SCHOOL says , ` THESE KIDS ' TEACHER got ta come .
YOUR DESIGNATED SCHOOL 's THESE KIDS ' TEACHER designated school .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got to go . ''
YOUR DESIGNATED SCHOOL happened , and YOUR DESIGNATED SCHOOL happened to be THE TIME WHEN WE HAD ELIMINATED ALL OF THE CITY UNIT , but YOUR DESIGNATED SCHOOL did n't really get out of hand as far as any fighting , or any cutting , shooting .
Nothing like YOUR DESIGNATED SCHOOL ever happened , but THEY were just forcing THEY way .
THEY says , `` WE 're going to school there .
Irregardless WE 're going to school . ''
THE DEPUTIES did n't go and pick up anybody and put THE DEPUTIES in the van and take THE DEPUTIES back .
THE DEPUTIES never did suffer THE DEPUTIES .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL , about TEN O'CLOCK that SUNDAY MORNING , DANFORD says , '' THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm going to THE BOARD OF EDUCATION .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm going to resign . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL , please do n't do TEN O'CLOCK .
Please . ''
`` Oh , '' DANFORD says , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm going .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm leaving THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm going to resign . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hated THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT because MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL was MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL was very strict .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL was very strict .
THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS ? WE had THE DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL was very strict , and THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL knew that , and THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS .
WE all knew , and WE was loyal to MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL .
MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL was MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL , but MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL went , and MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL did n't come back .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'll call NAMES , MR. Harbert Moore and HERMAN DIAL 'S , who is deceased .
WE met with HERMAN DIAL 'S that afternoon down at HERMAN DIAL 'S home .
NAMES 's where TARA is living right now , TARA and TARA husband , and WE pleaded with MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL , and DANFORD strongly rejected .
HER HUSBAND says , `` Gentlemen , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've resigned .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm not coming back .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER plea is of NO AVAIL . ''
HER HUSBAND says , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm not coming back now . ''
Well , WE stayed with HER HUSBAND THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS know until about maybe ONLY THREE or FOUR , almost sundown on that particular day .
WE left , and then `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING told THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS , `` WE 're going to make THESE KIDS ' TEACHER acting . ''
`` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING asked THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS in the next day .
`` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING called THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS to THE BOARD OF EDUCATION , and all the board members was there .
MALCOLM MCLEOD was MALCOLM MCLEOD .
MALCOLM MCLEOD was there , and THEY asked THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS -
Okay , go ahead , acting principal .
THEY asked THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS would THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS accept the position as acting principal , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told THEY , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS says , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS have ONE REQUEST , '' and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS would accept ONE REQUEST on THIS , A GREAT POLITICIAN , `` that THESE KIDS ' TEACHER give MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL JUST TWO or three weeks to reconsider , '' because THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS felt that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS could convince MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL to come back , plus with MR. HARBERT and HERMAN DIAL 'S and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS dealing with MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL .
Well , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had a relationship , and WE all had a good relationship in THE COMMUNITY , THAT EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW .
And THEY says , `` If ONE REQUEST 's ONE REQUEST , WE 'll honor that request , and effective today THESE KIDS ' TEACHER will be acting THE PRINCIPAL OF OXENDINE SCHOOL AND MYSELF . ''
So THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS came on back to school , and WE started trying to operate as a normal situation .
WE did .
WE got along REAL GOOD , HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP .
WE 's when THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS asked MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS .
WE called MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS MR. Can .
Everybody knew MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS as MR. Can , MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS asked MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS would MR. assist THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS , be MY ASSISTANT , and MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS said MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS would , so WE established A GOOD RELATIONSHIP , and A GOOD RELATIONSHIP went on like that knowing that MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS was as temporary as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was at THAT PARTICULAR TIME and situation there .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` WE do n't know what will happen . ''
MR. CAN was a history teacher at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME .
MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS should say .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm using everyday terminology .
CAN 's all right .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS use it so much .
But , anyway , HE said HE would .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` WE do n't know what 's going to happen with MR. HARBERT , '' and went on .
After `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING asked THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS to serve , said , `` When 'S `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING HERMAN DIAL 'S coming back , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS ? '' THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING on 'S .
Give WE another few days on 'S . ''
So `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING was very lenient .
`` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING went THE LIMIT , beyond THE LIMIT , because THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was n't pushing because at THAT PARTICULAR TIME THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was n't really anxious about being THE PRINCIPAL 'S .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was happy doing what THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was doing , and then WE were getting along REAL GOOD , HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP .
Everything was just going great as far as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was concerned .
But `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING refused , and `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING still refused .
`` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING kept REFUSING , NEVER would accept , so eventually REFUSING , NEVER says WE got to do REAL GOOD , HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP , so then they made THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS A PRINCIPAL , certified THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS as principal .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` Well , MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS Can , REAL GOOD , HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP kind of looks like THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm going to be THE PRINCIPAL 'S according to THE BOARD OF EDUCATION , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS want THESE KIDS ' TEACHER to be MY ASSISTANT . ''
So THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS accepted THE PRINCIPAL 'S position , and MR. WILLIAM C. CHAVIS CAN accepted the assistant principal 's position .
Then shortly after THE PRINCIPAL 'S POSITION , sometime later in THE YEAR , `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING told THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS , `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING says , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS , now , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're going to have to go get THESE KIDS ' TEACHER Masters degree . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS did n't have A MASTERS DEGREE .
A MASTERS DEGREE 's A MASTERS DEGREE .
A PRINCIPAL asked THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS willing to do A MASTERS DEGREE .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` Well , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'll give A MASTERS DEGREE a shot . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was fifty years old at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME , to be going to school .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had n't been to school for ONLY THIRTY-NINE YEARS , to renew THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS certificate , so THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told A PRINCIPAL THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS would .
So ONLY THIRTY-NINE YEARS was ONLY THIRTY-NINE YEARS .
So then , SPRING OF 72 THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS enrolled at East Carolina , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS went there for two sessions THAT SUMMER , and then went the fall semester and even the spring semester .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd go at THAT NIGHT , drive back and forth on Tuesdays and Thursday nights .
THAT NIGHT 's THAT NIGHT .
Yeah , about A THREE HOUR DRIVE EACH WAY .
A THREE HOUR DRIVE EACH WAY 's A THREE HOUR DRIVE EACH WAY , and WE got along well .
A THREE HOUR DRIVE EACH WAY was another great experience for THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS , especially that THAT SUMMER , SPRING OF 72 , summer of 72 .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS got along great , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS .
THE CAMPUS 's right .
WE had a good time .
WE got along REAL GOOD , HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP .
During this time how many WHITE AND BLACK STUDENTS were there at PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING ?
The most THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS ever had during THIRTEEN YEARS there , THIRTEEN YEARS was either TEN O'CLOCK whites-I want to think it was TEN O'CLOCK whites-maybe TEN O'CLOCK was TEN O'CLOCK THE BLACKS and ELEVEN whites .
To MY KNOWLEDGE WHITE AND BLACK STUDENTS 've never had any more than WHITE AND BLACK STUDENTS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know how many 's out there A TIME IN THE 50S , LATE 50S , but during THIRTEEN YEARS THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was THE PRINCIPAL 'S .
And about how big was the student body total ?
Almost eleven HUNDRED .
So A LOT of ruckus over JUST A FEW .
Oh , yeah .
ELEVEN HUNDRED kids .
We had a FOUR hundred-enrollment high school , K-12 .
All rode THE BUS together , kindergartners and twelfth graders rode THE BUS .
Okay .
SO ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL was about ELEVEN HUNDRED ?
Right .
And out of SO ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL THE PRINCIPAL 'S had twenty-one , twenty-two non-Indian students ?
Exactly right .
SO ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL 's amazing .
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB-
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- is .
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- is .
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- 's right .
-LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- is amazing .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS believe THE THINGS , THE STATEMENTS I 'VE MADE is very factual , because THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've tried not to edit nor delete .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've tried to be very factual with the information that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've shared with THESE KIDS ' TEACHER .
What was THE PRINCIPAL 'S relationship like with THE SCHOOL BOARD AT THE TIME ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS did n't have A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP with them at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME because being a teacher THESE KIDS ' TEACHER had A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP .
But after A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN WE HAD ON THE BOARD , HARRY WEST was HARRY WEST , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS got to know THAT , AND MR. HARRY WEST and WE established , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think , a very good relationship with THE BOARD MEMBERS .
Back then THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN WE HAD ON THE BOARD was THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN WE HAD ON THE BOARD .
NATIVE AMERICAN 's right .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR had understood that there were n't any before double voting was broken , but NATIVE AMERICAN 's not true ?
THE BOARD OF EDUCATION was n't widespread .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wo n't say yes to A THREE HOUR DRIVE EACH WAY , but MR. HARRY I BELIEVE was the THE FIRST Indian board .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER daddy could probably tell THESE KIDS ' TEACHER , verify A THREE HOUR DRIVE EACH WAY .
MR. HARRY I BELIEVE could tell .
Do THE PRINCIPAL 'S feel like double voting had an impact on THE PRINCIPAL 'S school and on YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD AT THE TIME ?
Yeah .
How ?
Exactly right .
It eliminated SOME OF THE FEELINGS that SOME OF THE FEELINGS had , that existed on a county-wide level , because SOME OF THE FEELINGS helped make GOOD DECISIONS for INDIAN SCHOOLS OR WHITE SCHOOLS , and yet RED SPRINGS could vote on ISSUES THAT INVOLVED US .
LUMBERTON DISTRICT could vote on ISSUES THAT INVOLVED US .
FAIRMONT DISTRICT could vote on ISSUES THAT INVOLVED US .
Rowland could vote on ISSUES THAT INVOLVED US , and MAXTON , THE WHOLE CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS shared THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT .
MAXTON , THE WHOLE CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM did n't have but FOURTEEN HUNDRED KIDS IN ALL THREE SCHOOLS .
FOURTEEN HUNDRED KIDS IN ALL THREE SCHOOLS had a primary , and a middle school , and THE HIGH SCHOOL THERE .
FOURTEEN HUNDRED KIDS IN ALL THREE SCHOOLS only had fourteen -LSB- HUNDRED -RSB- kids , and FOURTEEN HUNDRED KIDS IN ALL THREE SCHOOLS had superintendent .
FOURTEEN HUNDRED KIDS IN ALL THREE SCHOOLS had ONLY THREE principals .
FOURTEEN HUNDRED KIDS IN ALL THREE SCHOOLS had assistant superintendents .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know how MANY STAFF MEMBERS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wo n't even try to go into MANY STAFF MEMBERS , and all the extra help , and here THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was with ELEVEN HUNDRED kids with one principal and one assistant .
And ONE JANITOR and JUST TWO aides , ma'am .
ONE JANITOR 's ONE JANITOR .
Exactly right .
ONE JANITOR 's all WE had .
Do THE PRINCIPAL 'S feel like THAT CHANGED AFTER THE DOUBLE VOTING SYSTEM CHANGED ?
Yeah , THAT CHANGED AFTER THE DOUBLE VOTING SYSTEM CHANGED did change .
But at least WE could make WE vote , and WE could get THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL made that WE felt was best to represent WE , and THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL could n't vote to have SOME INPUT .
Yeah , WE was good .
WE was one of the greatest things to happen , eliminated double voting .
What about politics in PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING , in and around PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING , in the 1960s .
THE PRINCIPAL 'S know MR. HARBERT was telling MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR some things about the unified club and activities that MR. HARBERT would do .
And 1955 was 1955 , and WE 've kind of got THE UNITED CLUB OF PROSPECT , ITS INCEPTION not political now , but MR. LESTER BULLARD was instrumental .
MR. LESTER BULLARD was MR. LESTER BULLARD .
MALCOLM MCLEOD was MALCOLM MCLEOD .
WE tried to get SOME DEPUTIES up in THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY , and MR. LESTER BULLARD asked THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS to go down and talk to MALCOLM MCLEOD .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told MR. LESTER BULLARD THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS would , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS went down , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS asked SOME DEPUTIES , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` MALCOLM MCLEOD , sheriff , WE 'd like to have a deputy from THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY . ''
MR. LESTER BULLARD told THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS POINT BLANK , MR. LESTER BULLARD said , `` No , no way . ''
And THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY was THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
MR. LESTER BULLARD just said POINT BLANK , and THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY was THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
What reason did MR. LESTER BULLARD give ?
NO REASON .
MR. LESTER BULLARD said , `` No , ca n't do NO REASON . . ''
MR. LESTER BULLARD said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS ca n't do NO REASON . , '' and NO REASON . was NO REASON . .
And NO REASON . , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER know , naturally began to mushroom .
NO REASON . began to grow because WE wanted to do something .
WE wanted some change here .
WE 're going to do something .
WE 're going to get a deputy up in THIS AREA , MOST OF THE LAND IN THIS PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS feel like each community needs somebody close by , representation , inclusiveness .
Right .
THIS is what is good .
Right .
THAT WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT A LOT OF INDIANS WERE FIGHTING FOR AT THAT TIME .
THAT WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT A LOT OF INDIANS WERE FIGHTING FOR AT THAT TIME . 's exactly right , trying to bring about a greater unity on a county level , not just PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
THAT WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT A LOT OF INDIANS WERE FIGHTING FOR AT THAT TIME . were n't just trying to uplift PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING and omit everybody else .
THAT WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT A LOT OF INDIANS WERE FIGHTING FOR AT THAT TIME . wanted to grow together .
PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING 's PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING , grow together .
Let MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR see .
There was ANOTHER THING that ANOTHER THING reminded MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR of .
WHAT was WHAT ? Well , MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR 'll think of WHAT , but MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR had another question about MAYBE THAT PERIOD OF TIME where THE BLACKS and ELEVEN WHITES began to come to THE SCHOOL , THOSE KIDS .
What was the racial composition of the teachers at PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING ?
Okay .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm trying to think .
Was there a THE BLACK 'S teacher under MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL administration ? THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't think there was , but shortly after that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS got one , JUST TWO , ONLY THREE , FOUR .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS know that during THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS tenure as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hired FOUR Black teachers , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm trying to think how many white teachers .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS got JOHN MACARTHUR 'S , JOHN MACARTHUR 'S son 's wife .
JOHN MACARTHUR 'S was ONE that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wanted to hire , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS asked `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING .
`` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING told `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING , '' `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING says , `` THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 'll probably have trouble with ONE , hiring JOHN MACARTHUR 'S . ''
Because THE MACARTHURS , THE MACARTHURS THEY were ELEVEN WHITES , and THEY were in control and everything .
JESSE OXENDINE , YOU KNOW MY COUSIN said , `` Do THESE KIDS ' TEACHER think that PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING would accept that ? '' THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` `` MR. ALLEN , WE ' WORKING , go ahead . ''
JOHN MACARTHUR 'S came in , and JOHN MACARTHUR 'S was s jewel .
JOHN MACARTHUR 'S was JOHN MACARTHUR 'S , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS got JOHN MACARTHUR 'S in THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL in INDUSTRIAL ARTS .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL 's where JOHN MACARTHUR 'S came in , started teaching INDUSTRIAL ARTS .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL loved JOHN MACARTHUR 'S .
JOHN MACARTHUR 'S mingled .
JOHN MACARTHUR 'S 'd mingle with THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL , and JOHN MACARTHUR 'S got along so well .
Then THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hired JUST TWO , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hired A WHITE GIRL .
A WHITE GIRL 's still up there now .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS ca n't even think of A WHITE GIRL name now .
A NAME IN THIS SITUATION 's been so long .
Let A NAME IN THIS SITUATION see , how many ? THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm trying to think how many .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS believe ONLY THREE was ONLY THREE .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS only had about ONLY THREE white teachers in all .
So FOUR Black teachers and ONLY THREE white teachers ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think FOUR BLACK TEACHERS 's right .
And how did PROSPECT-THE PARENTS respond to THE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WE PLAYED ?
FINE .
FINE made PROSPECT-THE PARENTS blend right in .
JUST A GREAT , ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE
JUST A GREAT , ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE
FOUR BLACK TEACHERS as well ?
Yeah , FOUR BLACK TEACHERS as well .
FOUR BLACK TEACHERS 's interesting .
Why would there be so many ruffled feathers about students going THERE BUT NOT TEACHERS , THE PRINCIPAL 'S reckon ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know .
Was THERE BUT NOT TEACHERS Indian TEACHERS under MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL ?
Pardon ?
Was THERE BUT NOT TEACHERS only Indian teachers under MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't believe MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL had any - .
If THERE BUT NOT TEACHERS was , MR. DANFORD , THE PRINCIPAL did n't have but one black , maybe one black .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm trying to think if there was JOHN MACARTHUR 'S .
There may have been .
Yes , there was ONE WHITE TEACHER .
WHAT 's that A WHITE GIRL name ? Yeah GIRL 'S NAME 's right .
Now that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS recall back THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS can see .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS believe there was ONLY THREE white teachers THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had .
ONLY THREE white teachers , yeah .
Okay .
ONLY THREE white teachers , but THREE WHITE TEACHERS I HAD all came in , hard workers .
Got along real well .
So the racial tensions did n't really exist on THE TEACHER LEVEL OUT HERE ? NO , NEVER ?
WHITE SCHOOLS , on THE TEACHER LEVEL OUT HERE ? NO , NEVER .
What about between THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL ?
WHITE SCHOOLS .
WHITE SCHOOLS .
SURE did n't .
Well , MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR just wonder , so what do THE PRINCIPAL 'S attribute all of the passion over SURE ? THE PRINCIPAL 'S know what MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR mean ? MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR 'm just thinking about SURE again , someone listening to this tape who 's not familiar with THE COMMUNITY , THAT EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW , maybe who knows a little bit about MAYBE THAT PERIOD OF TIME , but if there 's so few students that WE 're talking about , there were THREE WHITE TEACHERS , YEAH . , there were not problems with teachers of other races coming into THE COMMUNITY , THAT EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY KNOW .
There 's THIS ISSUE OF TRADITION , MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR guess , but tell WE .
So THE PRINCIPAL 'S look at THIS ISSUE OF TRADITION objectively , and THIS ISSUE OF TRADITION does n't seem like well , there would be A BIG DEAL here , but A BIG DEAL was A BIG DEAL .
Can THE PRINCIPAL 'S sort of tell WE FORWARD A LITTLE BIT ?
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER know , SOME OF THOSE THINGS I 'M NOT ABLE .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't want to try to point out maybe some things that are not really factual issues , but SOME OF THOSE THINGS I 'M NOT ABLE seemed that WE believed in work at PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think TWO THINGS , MISS MAYNOR , THAT I THINK KEPT US ABREAST , AND KEPT US MOTIVATED , AND KEPT US GOING , AND THAT ELIMINATED A LOT OF OTHER FRIVOLOUS THINGS was one of the things , and WE believed in discipline at PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL .
TWO THINGS , MISS MAYNOR , THAT I THINK KEPT US ABREAST , AND KEPT US MOTIVATED , AND KEPT US GOING , AND THAT ELIMINATED A LOT OF OTHER FRIVOLOUS THINGS 's JUST TWO things , MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR , that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think kept WE abreast , and kept WE motivated , and kept WE going , and that eliminated a lot of other frivolous things .
When PROSPECT-THE PARENTS would come THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd say , `` Listen , ONE WHITE TEACHER - . ''
Yes , there was ANOTHER TEACHER THAT CAME TO MY MIND .
ANOTHER TEACHER THAT CAME TO MY MIND 's down the Berry section way down below LUMBERTON DISTRICT .
ANOTHER TEACHER THAT CAME TO MY MIND came up there .
ANOTHER TEACHER THAT CAME TO MY MIND 's still surviving .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS remember ANOTHER TEACHER THAT CAME TO MY MIND too .
TWO THINGS , MISS MAYNOR , THAT I THINK KEPT US ABREAST , AND KEPT US MOTIVATED , AND KEPT US GOING , AND THAT ELIMINATED A LOT OF OTHER FRIVOLOUS THINGS are coming back .
So actually there was FOUR whites .
Yeah .
Yeah .
FOUR might end up at FIVE .
But anyway , there was one thing going back , good hard work and discipline .
Those JUST TWO things kept PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING aboard , kept US going , kept US making , if THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS may say , progress .
OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE was OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER come to school to get AN EDUCATION .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER do n't come to school to put on no acts .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER come to school to get AN EDUCATION , and if THESE KIDS ' TEACHER come THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 're expected to do YOUR HOMEWORK .
And if THESE KIDS ' TEACHER do n't do YOUR HOMEWORK , boy-and PROSPECT-THE PARENTS knew this .
In the PTA THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told PROSPECT-THE PARENTS , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told PROSPECT-THE PARENTS .
PROSPECT-THE PARENTS knew .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS lived here all THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS life , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS taught out there , and PROSPECT-THE PARENTS knew if A KID came to MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm not boasting but any means .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm just being factual .
PROSPECT-THE PARENTS knew if A KID came to a classroom and did n't have A KID homework , A KID had had A BAD DAY .
The paddle was going to go .
A KID knew that .
PROSPECT-THE PARENTS knew that .
PROSPECT-THE PARENTS knew that .
PROSPECT-THE PARENTS said , `` THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 'd better not go in A KID class unless THESE KIDS ' TEACHER got YOUR HOMEWORK . ''
PROSPECT-THE PARENTS knew that .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS instilled that in THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS expect THESE KIDS ' TEACHER to work .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS expect THESE KIDS ' TEACHER to control ANOTHER CLASS .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER do n't send any kids to THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS office .
YOU DISCIPLINE .
If THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS have to go to THE BOARD OF EDUCATION , '' THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'll lead THESE KIDS ' TEACHER .
If THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got to go to court , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'll go with THESE KIDS ' TEACHER , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'll tell YOU DISCIPLINE . , ` Listen , THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS is THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS , not no action .
If THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS takes disciplinary action WE 're going to air THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS out . ' ''
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS believe THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS is THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS , and PARENTS THAT LIVED ON THE WEST SIDE OF RED HILL ROAD accepted THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS , PARENTS THAT LIVED ON THE WEST SIDE OF RED HILL ROAD knew THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS , and PARENTS THAT LIVED ON THE WEST SIDE OF RED HILL ROAD had no objection as long as THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL was being taught , and as long as THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL was being disciplined .
And most of THE PARENTS BELIEVED IN GOOD , STRONG DISCIPLINE , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd say ninety , ninety-five percent of THE PARENTS BELIEVED IN GOOD , STRONG DISCIPLINE .
And THE PARENTS BELIEVED IN GOOD , STRONG DISCIPLINE supported .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS is one of the things that kept the animosity , THE ILL-WILL FEELING , or THE LITTLE FRIVOLOUS THINGS THAT SURFACED , THE LITTLE FRIVOLOUS THINGS THAT SURFACED 's THE LITTLE FRIVOLOUS THINGS THAT SURFACED .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS really do .
THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS sounds like there 's a lot of consistency , and that THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY were THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY .
THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS 's right .
Exactly right .
THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS 's right .
And THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN knew THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't mind telling THESE KIDS ' TEACHER .
And THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS knew THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS , `` Hey , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS expect THESE KIDS ' TEACHER to work . ''
Right .
There 's one other thing MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR want to ask THE PRINCIPAL 'S about MAYBE THAT PERIOD OF TIME , and then MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR want to move FORWARD A LITTLE BIT to THE 1980S and THE PRINCIPAL 'S thoughts about the mergers of THE HIGH SCHOOLS and THEN OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM , but MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR want to ask about THE TUSCARORAS in THE 70S , what THE PRINCIPAL 'S impressions were of that movement ? Were THEN OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM involved in the goings on at PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL ?
Yes , right .
How ?
THE TUSCARORAS OVER AT MAXTON IN THE RED HILL SECTION , THAT 's where MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR are , and right up here on the Keever Road , but THE RED HILL was more active .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR were THE TUSCARORAS OVER AT MAXTON IN THE RED HILL SECTION , THAT , and THE TUSCARORAS were THE TUSCARORAS .
And MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR said , `` WE 're not going to OXENDINE SCHOOL THAT CAME TO PROSPECT .
WE 're not going to MAXTON SCHOOL . ''
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR said , `` WE 're not going to MAXTON SCHOOL . ''
THE TUSCARORAS OVER AT MAXTON IN THE RED HILL SECTION , THAT , THE TUSCARORAS OVER AT MAXTON IN THE RED HILL SECTION , THAT 's when MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR extended THE DISTRICT LINES over to THE RED HILL .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR said , `` WE 're not going to MAXTON , THE WHOLE CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM . ''
And most of MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR did n't go .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR did n't go .
Maybe one or JUST TWO of them .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm not sure .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS wo n't put THE HIGHEST NUMBER WE EVER HAD on THE HIGHEST NUMBER WE EVER HAD , but MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR did n't go .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR said , `` WE wo n't even go to school .
WE wo n't even go to school .
WE 're not sending MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR to school . ''
WE did n't have a truant officer back then to go out and enforce truancy .
Maybe because of the situation the Native Americans , if MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR do n't get AN EDUCATION maybe AN EDUCATION 's all right .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR make THEIR OWN DECISION .
And THEIR OWN DECISION 's THEIR OWN DECISION .
If Indians fail to get AN EDUCATION MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR 're hurting nobody but US .
US 're hurting US if US do n't get AN EDUCATION .
US 's THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS .
US was how A TUSCARORA were dealing with THIS SITUATION .
SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE then were A TUSCARORA parents ?
SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE certainly were .
Do THE PRINCIPAL 'S think that when SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE took on that identity as THE TUSCARORAS OVER AT MAXTON IN THE RED HILL SECTION , THAT , had that group of folks always had that , or was that THEIR OWN DECISION , THE PRINCIPAL 'S know what MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR mean , resistance to THIS SITUATION ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE kept A LOW PROFILE until MAYBE THAT PERIOD OF TIME , and SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE suddenly up here .
But SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE kept A LOW PROFILE low .
SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE had SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE little gatherings though , but A LOW PROFILE was n't wide spread .
A LOW PROFILE was just a very few .
And SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE did n't .
SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE 'd go ahead and go to school somewhat , but SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE did n't boast out , maybe ONE or JUST TWO would say , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm A TUSCARORA , '' or something like this .
ONE did n't get out of hand .
ONE did n't raise to THAT MUCH OTHER than THAT ONE TIME , and when all of that uproar was that opening A BAD DAY , THE TUSCARORAS was right in THE MIDST OF THAT .
SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE were in THE MIDST OF THAT .
And SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE were claiming SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE as THE TUSCARORAS OVER AT MAXTON IN THE RED HILL SECTION , THAT ?
Oh SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE were claiming .
SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE 's right .
Did that create some opposition or some conflict ?
Yeah .
UM-HUM , RIGHT .
UM-HUM , RIGHT . did .
What kind of conflict ?
Well , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd rather not even go into THAT ISSUE PART OF IT .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS just like to omit .
THAT ISSUE PART OF IT 's one little tiny bit THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd like to omit and not even share that with THESE KIDS ' TEACHER .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR can understand THAT ISSUE PART OF IT .
Okay .
Well , let 'S talk about THE 1980S .
Were THE PRINCIPAL 'S principal ? Let MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR see , MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR guess THE PRINCIPAL 'S retired when they merged THE HIGH SCHOOLS ?
WHITE SCHOOLS , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS retired one THE YEAR after .
One year after WHITE SCHOOLS .
Okay .
So tell us then about leading up to the merging THE HIGH SCHOOLS .
Why was THE FINAL DECISION made , and who made THE FINAL DECISION ?
Well , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT and some of THE BOARD MEMBERS was instrumental in bringing THIS ABOUT .
There had been a study , so THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS understand , made of the conditions of PEMBROKE -RSB- , PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING , and MAXTON , THE WHOLE CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM .
THIS is THE TIME WHEN WE HAD ELIMINATED ALL OF THE CITY UNIT .
THIS was all under one big umbrella then , all big umbrella now .
WE superintendent , THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT was THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT .
So THEY said , `` Well , WE 're going to see if WE can change THE THINGS , THE STATEMENTS I 'VE MADE . ''
One of the issues was that THEY claimed PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING was not large enough to equip WE students and to get WE students to THE TEACHER LEVEL OUT HERE ? NO , NEVER that THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL should be to advance AN EDUCATION , going into college and what have THESE KIDS ' TEACHER .
MAXTON , THE WHOLE CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM at AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR BLACK KIDS THAT WAS COMING AT THAT TIME was a run down school .
THEY physical plant was so awful .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS never did go inside of MAXTON SCHOOL .
Never been inside of one of them .
ONE TIME THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS went to THE PRINCIPAL 'S office at THE HIGH SCHOOL THERE , Mr. Graham , but as far as going in THE CLASSROOMS , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS never visited there .
Not that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had anything against THEM , with THE PRINCIPAL 'S , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS just did n't visit the sites .
THEM claimed that to rebuild that school would be so expensive THEM could n't do ONE TIME from a financial standpoint .
THEM said , `` Well , let 'S put THEM all together . ''
Let THEM merge , consolidate , whichever term THESE KIDS ' TEACHER feel is appropriate .
THEM had public hearings on THEM , and when THEM came to PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING , there was opposition , strong opposition , of THEM doing this .
JAMES MOORE , JAMES MOORE would be ANOTHER ONE if THESE KIDS ' TEACHER wanted to interview JAMES MOORE sometime , JAMES MOORE was against ANOTHER ONE .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was against ANOTHER ONE , and there were a few more folks against ANOTHER ONE .
WE spoke up THAT NIGHT .
WE felt like THE BEST THING is not THE BEST THING .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS told THESE KIDS ' TEACHER about how MR. SWETT , and how THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS felt about PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS shared that with THESE KIDS ' TEACHER earlier .
Tell WE WE again because MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR did n't get that on tape THE LAST TIME .
THE PRINCIPAL 'S 're talking about MR. PURNELL SWETT . .
MR. PURNELL SWETT .
THE FIRST INDIAN SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT .
Right .
Right .
So THE FIRST INDIAN SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT . came , and THE FIRST INDIAN SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT . asked THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS SO MUCH HARD FEELINGS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS was not in favor of THE FIRST , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS asked THE FIRST INDIAN SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT . specifically .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` Now , MR. SWETT , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS want to know how this is going to help PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL , individually .
Not PEMBROKE -RSB- .
Not MAXTON , THE WHOLE CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM .
How will PEMBROKE -RSB- help Prospect ? '' So MR. SWETT , MR. SWETT says , `` PEMBROKE -RSB- wo n't help PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING . ''
Well , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` MR. SWETT , '' and we were of good humor , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm kind of prejudiced and biased .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS want PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING to come out THE BEST HE POSSIBLY CAN . ''
And MR. SWETT kind of smiled , but MR. SWETT says , `` PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING wo n't . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THESE KIDS ' TEACHER do n't want THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS to support THE END OF THAT . ''
MR. SWETT smiled , and walked away , and THE END OF THAT was THE END OF THAT .
THE END OF THAT finally came , but the big issue , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think , was that PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING was not enough to justify PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING , but WE had all the goods right there .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` Look at THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO OXENDINE SCHOOL WE 've got WE 's come out of PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
WE 've got the lawyers .
WE 've got the doctors .
WE 've got the plant managers that 's come right out of Prospect School with this little curriculum . ''
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS attribute THIS to THE FACT that WE teachers , most of THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS knew every parent .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm not boasting again on THIS , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hope THIS wo n't sound like THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm boasting .
But THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS could walk in THE CLASSROOMS , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS could name ninety percent of THOSE KIDS ' PARENTS , because THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS taught , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS taught a lot of THEIR PARENTS .
If A PROBLEM surfaced , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` Do THESE KIDS ' TEACHER want THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS to talk to THE ONLY DAUGHTER and YOUR DADDY `` No , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS .
No . ''
A PROBLEM eliminated MORE DISCIPLINE right there , and YOUR MOTHER AND DADDY ABOUT YOU ? '' knew what was expected .
THOSE KIDS ' PARENTS knew , the ones that THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS taught , THOSE KIDS ' PARENTS knew what THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS expected .
THE END OF THAT was THE END OF THAT .
THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS is THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS , but THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS seemed that THE TIME WHEN WE HAD ELIMINATED ALL OF THE CITY UNIT was to have a big school , big number .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm sorry to say , that THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS has n't gelled in THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS opinion .
THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS has n't gelled .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm going to die pretty soon , and THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS would be one of my greatest desires , that THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS would gel .
But THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm afraid , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS doubt THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hope THESE KIDS ' TEACHER live to see THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hope THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 'll be able to sit down and talk to JIM .
JIM said THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS would n't , but JIM said THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS has gone on and THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS has become a reality .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hope THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS will .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hope THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS will , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS doubt seriously .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't think THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS know , THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS 's left some marks from crossing THE DISTRICT LINES , from racial issues , that 's not left PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING community happy .
So THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS has n't benefited Prospect ? What do THE PRINCIPAL 'S think has been the impact on THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL and have to go down to Purnell Swett High School ?
Detrimental .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL do n't feel like THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL belong .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL 's right .
Is there something THE PRINCIPAL 'S feel like could be done to change THIS SITUATION ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've been asked that question so many times .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know if there is anything that THESE KIDS ' TEACHER could put YOUR FINGER on that would bring an instant change , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS guess if WE keep working at YOUR FINGER , do n't give up , have hope and faith , keep striving .
One of the big issues right now is WE kids .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know how PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING compares to OTHERS , but THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS know WE got some of OTHERS dropping out .
The drop out rate is something to think about .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS understand OTHERS lose FOUR HUNDRED kids over there .
OTHERS 's sad .
OTHERS 's sad .
If OTHERS could eliminate that , FOUR HUNDRED would be FOUR HUNDRED .
And OTHERS 're doing , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS understand , everything literally possible , if THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS must use THIS EVERYDAY LANGUAGE , to try to eradicate THIS EVERYDAY LANGUAGE .
OTHERS 've got after INDIAN SCHOOLS , Saturday schools , evening schools , everything to try to motivate OTHERS to keep OTHERS going .
But for SOME REASON OTHERS fall by the wayside .
SOME REASON 's one of the issues .
If OTHERS could eliminate that , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS understand OTHERS 're spending big bucks to try to eradicate SOME REASON , but to NO AVAIL .
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS .
And then , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hate to say THAT ONE OF THE THINGS . , but when OTHERS went over there-I do n't even want to say that-the races , THE BLACKS and THE GIRLS and the boys band together .
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS . 's not being good to THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL .
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS . 's not being good .
And THE PARENTS BELIEVED IN GOOD , STRONG DISCIPLINE are upset about THAT ONE OF THE THINGS . , and THIS KIND OF THING . .
THE PARENTS BELIEVED IN GOOD , STRONG DISCIPLINE go with THAT ONE OF THE THINGS . .
WHAT did THESE KIDS ' TEACHER expect ? And there 's animosity just about every day in THE HALLS .
THE BLACKS say THE LEAST LITTLE THING and THE LEAST LITTLE THING sparks .
THE LEAST LITTLE THING 's ready to explode instantly from what THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 've been told .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS have n't been over there .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't know .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS guess MR. WES -LSB- THE PRINCIPAL -RSB- is doing THE BEST HE POSSIBLY CAN , but THE BEST HE POSSIBLY CAN 's just before happening .
A BOMB just set to explode .
A BOMB 's sad .
A BOMB 's sad .
A BOMB feels like especially like after all the work that 's been done .
A BOMB 's right , to try to prevent A BOMB .
But THESE KIDS ' TEACHER live under that pressure .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm sure THE TEACHERS WHO WERE SPORTS live there expecting that anything could happen-massive fight in THE HALLS .
THIS KIND OF THING .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hope THIS KIND OF THING . do n't .
TEACHERS do n't have to live every day , every minute of TEACHERS lives there might be a gun and start shooting in there .
THIS KIND OF THING . is THIS KIND OF THING . .
But all of what 's happened all around , naturally .
THIS KIND OF THING . 's in the back -LSB- of TEACHERS minds -RSB- right there .
TEACHERS think about THIS KIND OF THING . .
How many more kids will get upset if THESE KIDS ' TEACHER dismiss TEACHERS from school , and come in there , walk in AK47 ?
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR hope not .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS hope not , too .
TEACHERS 's THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS .
MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR
THE THING THAT KEPT A LOT OF PARENTS
WE did n't have that problem at PROSPECT , THE PUBLIC HEARING .
THE KIDS WHO SURROUNDED THE SCHOOL did n't even have weapons .
And I TOLD THOSE BOYS , THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL , I 'D TELL THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN 'S office , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER give I TOLD THOSE BOYS , THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL , I 'D TELL THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR.

And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS says , `` I TOLD THOSE BOYS , THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL , I 'D TELL THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN 'S after noon I TOLD THOSE BOYS , THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL , I 'D TELL THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR.

CAN 'S back to THESE KIDS ' TEACHER .
JUST do n't bring JUST . ''
Now THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` If THESE KIDS ' TEACHER bring JUST , WE 're going to get JUST , take JUST , confiscate JUST . ''
But THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` Now , if WE catch THESE KIDS ' TEACHER during THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WITH IT , and somebody will tell THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WITH IT , WE 're going to get THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WITH IT . ''
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'll keep THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WITH IT .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS love to fish .
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WITH IT will be THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WITH IT . ''
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS talked just in that tone .
They knew that .
THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED 's THE WAY THE COMMITTEE OPERATED , and WE did n't have no major problems .
THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN knew .
THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN knew what to expect , and WE pre-warned THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm telling THESE KIDS ' TEACHER THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER ca n't say , `` Well , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS did n't know . ''
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'd meet with THE WHOLE HIGH SCHOOL THE FIRST DAY .
Everybody knew what was expected at high school .
THE WHOLE HIGH SCHOOL THE FIRST DAY 's THE WHOLE HIGH SCHOOL THE FIRST DAY .
THESE KIDS ' TEACHER expected disputes , disruptions and things of THAT NATURE , but THAT NATURE 's what THAT NATURE all was .
And THE LITTLE MINI-FIGHTS WE HAD THERE , MOST OF THE TIME THAT NATURE was JUST TWO girls fighting over a boy .
-LSB- JJ laughs . -RSB-
Maybe THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS should n't have even said that .
But THE LITTLE MINI-FIGHTS WE HAD THERE , MOST OF THE TIME 's little things like THE LITTLE MINI-FIGHTS WE HAD THERE , MOST OF THE TIME .
THE LITTLE MINI-FIGHTS WE HAD THERE , MOST OF THE TIME 's THE LITTLE MINI-FIGHTS WE HAD THERE , MOST OF THE TIME .
THE LITTLE MINI-FIGHTS WE HAD THERE , MOST OF THE TIME 's interesting that SOME PEOPLE say , `` Well , we 'll look at all the ways that children have benefited from greater access and inclusion in THE SCHOOL SYSTEM , '' but then on THE OTHER HAND there 's this side of THE OTHER HAND where THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN feel like THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN do n't belong , SOME PEOPLE 're going to be harmed .
Is that THE PRINCIPAL 'S feeling ?
THE ILL-WILL FEELING 's exactly right .
THE ILL-WILL FEELING 's right .
We 've got SOME THAT 'S GOING ON .
Someone has said that the better ones is going to progress in A STATEMENT THAT 'S USED QUITE OFTEN .
A STATEMENT THAT 'S USED QUITE OFTEN 's A STATEMENT THAT 'S USED QUITE OFTEN .
Then THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got THE UPPER , THE ELITES .
THE ELITES 're going to go .
THE ELITES 're going to get THE UPPER somewhere .
But then THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got a group in there that 's got to deal with THE UPPER .
Then THESE ONES ON THE BOTTOM , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got to do everything THESE KIDS ' TEACHER can to keep THESE ONES ON THE BOTTOM in .
THOSE KIDS , HIGH SCHOOL , `` IF YOU BRING A WEAPON TO SCHOOL , BY MISTAKE , '' BEING OUT ON THE FARM THOSE BOYS HAVE KNIVES AND THINGS , I SAID , `` YOU GO TO MR. CAN , MY GREATER ABSENTEE AREA was MY GREATER ABSENTEE AREA .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS knew MY GREATER ABSENTEE AREA , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS worked with MY GREATER ABSENTEE AREA .
High school attendance , THE KIDS FROM OXENDINE THEY 'D STAY OUT UP THERE FOR LITTLE FRIVOLOUS THINGS .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS had to prod THE KIDS FROM OXENDINE THEY 'D STAY OUT UP THERE FOR LITTLE FRIVOLOUS THINGS .
Okay , over there , TEACHERS TEACHERS do n't know PROSPECT-THE PARENTS .
TEACHERS do n't know TEACHERS parents .
Well , THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS knew THEIR PARENTS , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS could tell SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE CLASS , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS expect THESE KIDS ' TEACHER to kind of keep SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE CLASS in school , '' and THEIR PARENTS 'd say , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'll call THEIR PARENTS . ''
THE PERCENTAGE THAT DROP OUT RIGHT THERE 's THE PERCENTAGE THAT DROP OUT RIGHT THERE .
THE PERCENTAGE THAT DROP OUT RIGHT THERE 's THE PERCENTAGE THAT DROP OUT RIGHT THERE .
And then THAT MUCH OTHER , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've got to do what THESE KIDS ' TEACHER can with the middle section .
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO up here , THESE KIDS ' TEACHER just keep THEM motivated , and THEM 're going to go on .
THEM 're going to go on .
But when THESE KIDS ' TEACHER start losing FOUR HUNDRED kids , FOUR HUNDRED 's FOUR HUNDRED .
Yeah .
Well , just out of curiosity , what was the drop out rate like when PROSPECT HIGH SCHOOL existed ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS dare n't say we had a three percent drop out .
AND EIGHTH now AND EIGHTH 's what ? NINE or something ? Six or NINE .
Probably .
Yeah .
AND EIGHTH sounds like AND EIGHTH makes A BIG DIFFERENCE .
AND EIGHTH 's about all the questions MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR have .
NOW WE EVEN EXCHANGE . , what else do THE PRINCIPAL 'S feel like THE PRINCIPAL 'S 'd want to say that MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR 've left out ?
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've covered NOW WE EVEN EXCHANGE . from AN EDUCATIONAL STANDPOINT and a community standpoint .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think THESE KIDS ' TEACHER 've been very inclusive .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS really do .
Okay .
Yeah , because MY CLASSROOM-MISS MAYNOR wanted to try to get at THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY .
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY seems like something that in some ways makes Indian education , maybe not unique is the right word , but THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY definitely defines THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY .
Right .
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY definitely helps THE PRINCIPAL 'S to understand THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY if THE PRINCIPAL 'S understand that relationship .
Okay .
And THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS want to think that maybe WE 're making progress with all the things that 's happening now , especially as THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS look at WE little capital now there -LSB- PEMBROKE -RSB- .
WE 've got a new town office .
WE 're getting A BIG WAL-MART coming in , and another big Kerr Drugs is there .

A LONG TIME COMING 's been A LONG TIME COMING , but A LONG TIME COMING looks like WE 've moving ahead by leaps and bounds , and THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm so happy .
THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS 'm so happy for A LONG TIME COMING .

THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS said , `` THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS do n't believe THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS will . ''
Sometimes THE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN AT THAT CAMPUS think about THE FIRST TIME .
TOM OXENDINE . looked at THE FIRST TIME .

TOM OXENDINE . was one of the ones that came back .
SO MANY OF THOSE PARENTS WHO WERE HOLDING THEIR KIDS OUT OF OXENDINE did n't .
