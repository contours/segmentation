TAPE 11.18.03-BM is TAPE 11.18.03-BM .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM is REVEREND BOB MANGUM .
The interviewer is THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION .
We are near PEMBROKE , NORTH CAROLINA .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION 'll ask YOU to begin in 1958 when YOU arrived here .
What were the impressions that YOU had , and what were SOME OF THE FIRST EXPERIENCES YOU HAD WORKING WITH INDIAN PEOPLE ?
Well , as perhaps LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know , REVEREND BOB MANGUM came in 1958 as PASTOR OF FIRST UNITED METHODIST CHURCH IN PEMBROKE , and then also as pastoral counselor to the THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , THE COMMISSION ON RELIGION AND RACE student movement and thereby got to work with not only THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , THE COMMISSION ON RELIGION AND RACE students from SOME OF THE FIRST EXPERIENCES YOU HAD WORKING WITH INDIAN PEOPLE denomination but STUDENTS THAT RELATED TO THE LUMBER RIVER METHODIST HOLINESS CONFERENCE WHICH INCLUDED JAMES WOODS .
Then also because of SUMMER ACTIVITY SUMMER ACTIVITY brought about a planning council for the spiritual emphasis on campus , brought together the Baptist Student Union leadership as well as the THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , THE COMMISSION ON RELIGION AND RACE leadership in a retreat each summer .
So immediately REVEREND BOB MANGUM was able to begin to related to STUDENTS THAT RELATED TO THE LUMBER RIVER METHODIST HOLINESS CONFERENCE WHICH INCLUDED JAMES WOODS in coming to PEMBROKE as well as to adults .
Then very quickly REVEREND BOB MANGUM became involved , because of the leadership of BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE and was committed to VOLUNTEER PRISON MINISTRY at the LUMBERTON unit , and invited REVEREND BOB MANGUM to become involved in VOLUNTEER PRISON MINISTRY there with BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE and with other volunteers .
So just about as soon as REVEREND BOB MANGUM got to PEMBROKE REVEREND BOB MANGUM became involved in VOLUNTEER PRISON MINISTRY .
At '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE then became ill and passed away shortly after .
BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE probably died in ' 59 , but A MR. OXENDINE , whose A FIRST name BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE went by initials .
BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE was BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE , and MISS MARY LIVERMORE was working with BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE .
BISHOP JAMES LOWRY WHO WAS THEN BISHOP OF THE LUMBER RIVER HOLINESS CONFERENCE was in leadership at '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED and until MISS MARY LIVERMORE having to give up MISS MARY LIVERMORE volunteer services and no longer be able to participate .
So , REVEREND BOB MANGUM immediately became involved with VOLUNTEER PRISON MINISTRY , and the challenge was that WE form an organization to perpetuate VOLUNTEER PRISON MINISTRY , and WE did called THE PRISONERS ' Friends Society .
THE REVEREND JAMES WOODS is now THE CHAIR , I THINK , OF THAT COMMITTEE TO BUILD A CHAPEL .
JAMES became a bishop of THE LUMBER RIVER METHODIST HOLINESS CONFERENCE WHICH INCLUDED JAMES WOODS and was for A NUMBER OF YEARS .
In the development of THE PRISONERS ' FRIENDS SOCIETY and A NATIVE AMERICAN PRISON CAMP AT THAT TIME , A NATIVE AMERICAN PRISON CAMP AT THAT TIME was A NATIVE AMERICAN PRISON CAMP AT THAT TIME as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD recall , there was a great deal of input and commitment on the part of THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY , on the part of MISS MARY LIVERMORE , and Miss Grace Garthwaite who came to be CHILDREN 'S BIBLE MISSION LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY , to teach bible in THE SCHOOLS and to have camping programs in the summer for young people .
THE NATIVE AMERICAN was very much involved in VOLUNTEER PRISON MINISTRY also .
Mr. MR. WILLIE LOCKLEAR FROM THE ASHPOLE COMMUNITY , there were A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED , Mrs. Caldwell from LUMBERTON .
THE PRISONERS ' FRIENDS SOCIETY , THE PRISONERS ' Friends Society , was organized and ESSENTIALLY ALL THE LEADERSHIP IN THAT GROUP was THE NATIVE AMERICAN to serve that THE NATIVE AMERICAN camp .
As a part of VOLUNTEER PRISON MINISTRY there came surfacing the strong desire to have A CHAPEL .
A CHAPEL was to provide for religious services for THE INMATES , and an effort began back in THE EARLY '60S , about ' 60 , '61 to build A CHAPEL .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM was THE CHAIR , I THINK , OF THAT COMMITTEE TO BUILD A CHAPEL .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION became CHILDREN 'S BIBLE MISSION LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY in FUND RAISING , and THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION worked to raise funds from throughout OUR Native American community .
Most of the money , and practically all of the money , that was raised to build A CHAPEL came from THE NATIVE AMERICAN people , from individuals , from churches .
And finally OUR were able to get THE FIRST CHAPEL BUILT ON ANY PRISON CAMP IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA , TO OUR KNOWLEDGE , THAT WAS BUILT BY THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS , FUND RAISING , OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY .
OUR helped THE FIRST CHAPEL BUILT ON ANY PRISON CAMP IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA , TO OUR KNOWLEDGE , THAT WAS BUILT BY THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS , FUND RAISING , OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY in designing A CHAPEL , and then got the state to agree to build THE FIRST CHAPEL BUILT ON ANY PRISON CAMP IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA , TO OUR KNOWLEDGE , THAT WAS BUILT BY THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS , FUND RAISING , OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY with NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE labor , and OUR supplied simply the money for the materials .
So THE FIRST CHAPEL BUILT ON ANY PRISON CAMP IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA , TO OUR KNOWLEDGE , THAT WAS BUILT BY THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS , FUND RAISING , OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY was THE FIRST CHAPEL BUILT ON ANY PRISON CAMP IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA , TO OUR KNOWLEDGE , THAT WAS BUILT BY THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS , FUND RAISING , OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY .
A FIRST was A FIRST as far as OUR knew in THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA .
After A FIRST there were other chapels built , but the one built by the LUMBEE INDIAN , to OUR knowledge , was A FIRST .
A FIRST was dedicated in 1964 , that chapel .
A FIRST has a placard on THE BUILDING NOW that relates to THE BUILDING NOW .
So , REVEREND BOB MANGUM came here from Asbury Theological Seminary where REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'd graduated from being a pastor of three churches in the southern part of Kentucky near Somerset , Kentucky .
And out of rural pastorate for two years while in seminary , and then having been reared in a rural community , REVEREND BOB MANGUM came to rural NORTH CAROLINA and lived in PEMBROKE at the parsonage in 1958 when Neila and REVEREND BOB MANGUM came here .
WE had PHYLLIS , PHYLLIS .
Then after that WE had the THOSE TWO other children .
WE remained there for THOSE FIVE YEARS , and then THE LORD opened THESE DOORS for WE to remain in THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY and pastor A FOUR-POINT CHARGE , Sandy Plains , a new work that was meeting in a garage in LUMBERTON , and then HICKORY GROVE IN MARLBORO COUNTY , and Fairview where the notable Mr. James K. Brayboy , Look Magazine teacher of the year , where THE LORD was THE LORD .
Then THE LORD friend Mr. Luke Hunt was one of the primary leaders also with HIS FRIEND MR. LUKE HUNT .
But A FOUR-POINT CHARGE was A FOUR-POINT CHARGE that REVEREND BOB MANGUM had beginning in ' 63 .
So during '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED REVEREND BOB MANGUM became involved in THOSE FIVE YEARS immediately with A QUITE A CONCERN and the needs of THE INMATES .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM became also very much aware of and concerned about THE TOTAL SOCIAL NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY , realizing the political disenfranchisement of NATIVE PEOPLE , OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS , of the poor in ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT .
And began to be concerned about how as a Christian who was working hard to get people prepared to find and discover personal salvation through faith in CHRIST , how in THE WORLD REVEREND BOB MANGUM could help PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS to find a better life here and get delivered from some of THE torment THE was here .
Not what may be hereafter , but the torment of being denied and being discriminated against , being exploited , the kinds of systems that WE had THAT DID NOT GIVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES , did not provide for the self development of all peoples according to THAT DID NOT GIVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES potential .
So REVEREND BOB MANGUM became quite concerned about VARIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTY .
In THE EARLY '60S MISS MARY LIVERMORE asked to bring together THE NATIVE AMERICAN people , THE BLACKS , and WHITES WHO 'VE BEEN HERE ALL THESE YEARS to start a forum talking about improving WE county , about justice , and about EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES .
So Dr. E. B. Turner who was an THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN leader , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM , and others gathered with MISS MARY LIVERMORE in MISS MARY LIVERMORE house in PEMBROKE back in THE EARLY '60S .
THIS LITTLE GATHERING began to converse and deal with THEIR CONCERNS .
THIS LITTLE GATHERING was THIS LITTLE GATHERING .
THIS LITTLE GATHERING grew into what was called THE COMMUNITY FORUM , and that THE COMMUNITY FORUM moved to LUMBERTON at First Baptist Church .
THE COMMUNITY FORUM issued a welcome and an invitation to the Friends Service Committee out of Greensboro to come and be involved in social ministry .
Well , later THE COMMUNITY FORUM was n't sure SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION wanted to own what SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION had invited , but SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION came , and SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION continued VOLUNTEER PRISON MINISTRY for A NUMBER OF YEARS during THE EARLY '60S .
SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION became involved in THE VOTER REGISTRATION , became involved , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think , in literacy , but SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION were here essentially to try to empower OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE for self-determination .
THIS came out of a very conservative kind of CHRISTIAN , THAT THIS IS GOD 'S WORK , AND THAT WE MUST DO ALL community gathering , and it was great that THIS happened as THIS did .
But anyway , SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION were initiated by THIS COMMUNITY , THIS CHRISTIAN FORUM , called THE COMMUNITY FORUM , and SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION were brought into A DIFFERENT DAY by that means .
What do YOU think - ?
A MR. OXENDINE worked in cooperation with SOME BRIDGE-BUILDING AND SOME RECONCILIATION for THE VOTER REGISTRATION , and worked in OUR NATIVE COMMUNITIES , OUR NATIVE COMMUNITIES , to bring about an awareness of a need for THE VOTER REGISTRATION .
In the meantime during THE EARLY '60S , MID-60S , DR. MARTIN BROOKS , who had come also in ' 58 , began to talk about double voting and about THE INEQUITIES .
JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS continued to call ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS AND THE WAY , and to the injustice of the multiple school ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS AND THE WAY that MID-60S were set up to have sanctuary from THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN and from the other charter units , and yet THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY was subject not only to THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN , THE STUDENTS , SIXTY PERCENT were THE NATIVE AMERICAN , twenty percent of THE STUDENTS , SIXTY PERCENT were THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN , and only twenty percent of THE STUDENTS , SIXTY PERCENT were CAUCASIAN , and yet every one of those FIVE charter units , every one of those towns was able to vote for THE COUNTY SYSTEM as well as for MID-60S own systems .
MID-60S own systems were sanctuary , the county without sanctuary was always subject to this strong white population in those cities that outvoted MID-60S .
So JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS ran for the county board .
JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS and THE REVEREND HARVEY LOWRY .
HE AND THE REVEREND HARVEY LOWRY . both lost , and HIS DESIRE TO SEE JUSTICE was because of this kind of double voting that denied THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE in the county to determine OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE own educational leadership .
Do YOU remember anything about the campaign and what kinds of issues HE AND THE REVEREND HARVEY LOWRY . tried to exert ?
Well , what REVEREND BOB MANGUM remember was that there was in THE ELECTION , MY UNDERSTANDING was , and JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS can clarify this , that the top vote-getter or top vote-getters would be put on THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS , would be put to THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS .
Well , and of course , if LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD won THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD would anyway .
But anyway , there was SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL PERSONS PUT ON THE , EXCUSE ME , THE BOARD OF EDUCATION , as an outcome of THE ELECTION .
Well , SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL PERSONS PUT ON THE , EXCUSE ME , THE BOARD OF EDUCATION did n't happen , and THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS put PERSONS ON THAT BOARD THAT WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VOTE OF THE COUNTY , excuse REVEREND BOB MANGUM , THE BOARD OF EDUCATION had PERSONS ON THAT BOARD THAT WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VOTE OF THE COUNTY .
We 'll put SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL PERSONS PUT ON THE , EXCUSE ME , THE BOARD OF EDUCATION THE WAY .
PERSONS ON THAT BOARD THAT WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VOTE OF THE COUNTY were representative of THE FULL VOTE , and therefore won , but THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN , had really elected THE REVEREND HARVEY LOWRY and JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS , but because of double voting THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN votes were canceled out , THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN winning , and THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN went to ANOTHER PERSON , an THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN and A NATIVE AMERICAN .
So then somewhere along there , about in there , SIM OXENDINE had also run , and maybe THE FULL VOTE was before A MR. OXENDINE or right after then , and A MR. OXENDINE was defeated .
So SIM , AND I , and Hughes Oxendine went to Governor Morgan 's office , excuse REVEREND BOB MANGUM , to Attorney General Morgan 's office .
SIM , AND I was about 1970 , along in there .
We just talked to SIM OXENDINE earnestly about THE INJUSTICE OF DOUBLE VOTING .
At '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED , REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't know , SIM OXENDINE might have initiated at SIM OXENDINE defeat-probably DR. MARTIN BROOKS defeat came in ' 68-and '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED 's probably '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm not sure .
But anyway , there was perhaps A SUIT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN INITIATED THEN .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm not certain .
Perhaps not .
A SUIT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN INITIATED THEN may be in THE DOCUMENT that REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've written .
Anyway , the Attorney General got THE LEGAL OPINION OF THE STATE and a response , and it was declared that double voting was legal and was just .
THE LEGAL OPINION OF THE STATE was THE LEGAL OPINION OF THE STATE .
Then WE went to THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT in RALEIGH , and RALEIGH was RALEIGH .
So then , of course , THE WAY IT WAS was made and THE WAY IT WAS was taken to THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS .
Well , during all of this time , during THE EARLY '70S , A LOT was happening to fortify this whole commitment to empower OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE .
WE wrote A GRANT for A LUMBEE CAUCUS to THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , THE COMMISSION ON RELIGION AND RACE , and then helped the Black community , urged OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE to do the same , and provided THE PROPOSAL THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN , THE PROPOSAL THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN , so A LUMBEE CAUCUS could be formed .
Then THE REVEREND DR. JIMMY CUMMINGS wrote A GRANT for A LUMBEE CAUCUS , and there was formed A LUMBEE CAUCUS , and in A LUMBEE CAUCUS , Hilton Oxendine from the LUMBERTON community , and there were others that were A PART OF IT , MYSELF AND MR. HARBERT MOORE out of the Prospect community as well as ADOLPH .
So A LUMBEE CAUCUS was A LUMBEE CAUCUS .
Then A LUMBEE CAUCUS made up A LUMBEE CAUCUS .
So the direction of A LUMBEE CAUCUS and somewhat also of A LUMBEE CAUCUS was THE VOTER REGISTRATION .
UNITED METHODIST FUNDING came in ' 71 , and from '71 until '96 WE received grants in succession , and WE received a total , the THOSE TWO entities received a total of $ 97,000 from THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , THE COMMISSION ON RELIGION AND RACE to do THE VOTER REGISTRATION .
During '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED WE registered 11,400 NATIVE AMERICANS and THE BLACKS .
Now , the majority of A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED was THE NATIVE AMERICAN , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't remember THE BREAKDOWN but A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED was more like SEVEN , or SEVEN , more like 7,000 and 4,400 probably .
But anyway , there were quite a few more 11,400 NATIVE AMERICANS registered than there were THE BLACKS .
WE also registered a number of whites during '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED , but THE SIGNIFICANT FACT was WE feel like WE empowered OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE to bring about change '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED was necessary and had not been brought about by the empowerment of THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN .
Now during this time of '70 to ' 76 , along in there , there was the strong input of AN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY DEVELOPER OF THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , and AN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY DEVELOPER OF THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH was AN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY DEVELOPER OF THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH .
THE FIRST INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY DEVELOPER , NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY DEVELOPER , IN THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH was THE FIRST INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY DEVELOPER , NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY DEVELOPER , IN THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , REVEREND BOB MANGUM believe .
This came trough THE WOMEN 'S Division of WE United Methodist Church .
THE WOMEN 'S worked hard for THE BREAKING OF DOUBLE VOTING and for THE VOTER REGISTRATION .
Then WE had other very strong players in THIS WHOLE PROCESS and THIS WHOLE PROCESS was JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS .
DEXTER was DEXTER during that time at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill .
One of his professors was BARRY NAKELL .
BARRY NAKELL then became involved as an act of gratis and love for justice , BARRY NAKELL became involved in THE DOUBLE VOTING ISSUE .
BARRY NAKELL became the attorney for the procedure , and to REVEREND BOB MANGUM knowledge BARRY NAKELL got NO MONEY FOR WHAT HE DID , NOR DID DEXTER .
So THEY kept OUR BEING abreast of the Voting Rights Act .
THEY worked for the redistricting and all that had to be done there to work for improved districting for better representation of ETHNIC PEOPLE .
And then worked with OUR BEING to gain VOTING REGISTRARS , VOTING REGISTRARS , being sure that OUR BEING had PERSONS ON THAT BOARD THAT WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VOTE OF THE COUNTY .
A QUITE A CONCERN was A QUITE A CONCERN , seeing all that happen .
ONE DAY OUR BEING were asking , there was MR. DANFORD DIAL , and ADOLPH , and AN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY DEVELOPER OF THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , and HERMAN , AND ADOLPH there , and OUR BEING were before THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS .
HERMAN , AND ADOLPH had OUR BEING there with a transcriber as if OUR BEING were before THE COURT , a transcriber there for OUR BEING THERE THAT DAY .
OUR BEING were appealing for THIS ROVING REGISTRAR just so OUR BEING could get more people registered .
Well , OUR BEING were denied ONE DAY , but as OUR BEING came back , one of the persons , REVEREND BOB MANGUM wo n't give LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD THIS ROVING REGISTRAR name , OUR BEING stopped at the Old Foundry Restaurant , and ANOTHER PERSON said , `` REVEREND BOB MANGUM can understand now why people riot and why there are FIRES BACK . ''
THIS ROVING REGISTRAR was so frustrated that OUR BEING had done THE LEGAL THING , THE LEGAL THING , and OUR BEING had appealed for something that was just and fair , and OUR BEING were denied .
Well , LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD perhaps know THE HISTORY , that THE DOMINANT RACE , were THE DOMINANT RACE , were CAUCASIAN .
Often THE REGISTRARS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AT THAT TIME AND DURING THE EARLY '60S , AND INTO THE '60S were THE REGISTRARS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AT THAT TIME AND DURING THE EARLY '60S , AND INTO THE '60S , and PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS often felt intimidated to go even to HER HOUSE IN PEMBROKE .
Well , THE REGISTRARS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AT THAT TIME AND DURING THE EARLY '60S , AND INTO THE '60S had to go to HER HOUSE IN PEMBROKE to get registered .
As well as THE REGISTRARS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AT THAT TIME AND DURING THE EARLY '60S , AND INTO THE '60S , for A WHILE THERE WAS THE LITERACY TEST .
There are all of these ways of denying and discouraging HER PEOPLE .
So REVOLUTIONARY DAYS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WAS BEING OPENED , WIDE OPEN were REVOLUTIONARY DAYS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WAS BEING OPENED , WIDE OPEN .
JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS , A WHILE THERE WAS THE LITERACY TEST was one of our key registrars .
A WHILE THERE WAS THE LITERACY TEST worked with A PASSION .
A WHILE THERE WAS THE LITERACY TEST became A ROVING REGISTRAR .
A WHILE THERE WAS THE LITERACY TEST wanted to see HER PEOPLE empowered , wanted to see BLACK PEOPLE EMPOWERED ALSO , BUT PARTICULARLY HER INDIAN PEOPLE .
Then we had Mrs. Lady Strickland .
HER PEOPLE 's HER PEOPLE .
A ROVING REGISTRAR was A ROVING REGISTRAR .
REVOLUTIONARY DAYS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WAS BEING OPENED , WIDE OPEN are PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS that , oh , PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS registered with A PASSION .
PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS would go to church events .
PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS would go to any kind of event PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS could to get people registered to vote .
So over THIS TIME PERIOD all of these things were happening , and as REVEREND BOB MANGUM said , in THE DOUBLE VOTING FINALLY , after working OUR socks off in the legislative caucus rooms in RALEIGH , going '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED after '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED , pleading for PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS to break double voting legislatively , OUR finally decided OUR 'd do a march .
So about 1974 , along in there , 1974 's in THE DOCUMENT , OUR marched on RALEIGH .
Got A PERMIT .
JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think , went up and got A PERMIT for OUR .
OUR got OUR permit .
There were policemen up on the roof , and here OUR came .
THAT MORNING OUR had A PRAYER MEETING .
OUR met at Stan Jones ' skating rink there across from the old town hall of PEMBROKE .
THAT MORNING OUR had prayer , Blind Cleve Jacobs was there to march , and THE REVEREND JAMES WOODS , and THE OTHERS .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION met OUR up there .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION was THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think , at '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED .
Well , anyway , MR. FOSTER JACOBS , a saint of YOUR GOD from the Sandy Plains Church .
OUR had some wonderful people up there .
OH OH forget THE THIS GENTLEMAN name .
Brother Isaiah .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM think PREACHER ISAIAH .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM think PREACHER ISAIAH was THERE THAT DAY .
PREACHER ISAIAH .
What 's PREACHER ISAIAH last name , PREACHER ISAIAH ?
MR. WILLIE LOCKLEAR FROM THE ASHPOLE COMMUNITY .
Yeah , MR. WILLIE LOCKLEAR FROM THE ASHPOLE COMMUNITY .
PREACHER ISAIAH .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM think PREACHER ISAIAH . was THERE THAT DAY .
So WE went to RALEIGH , and after all this time in A LUMBEE CAUCUS WE marched SEVEN times around THE LEGISLATIVE BUILDING believing A LUMBEE CAUCUS would count for something , something good would happen .
WE had THE EMANUELS , MR. AND MRS. EMANUEL from up at Bethel Hill Baptist Church .
THE EMANUELS , MR. AND MRS. EMANUEL were A PART OF IT , MYSELF AND MR. HARBERT MOORE up in Saddletree .
So WE had quite a gathering of PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS from across THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY .
But THAT MORNING WE had prayer , and JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS , the father of JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS , and JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS , and Bernice and Joyce , JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS came to A PRAYER MEETING , and JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS was ready to march , and JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS got a call that JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS sister had become ill and that HOWARD , AND BERNICE AND JOYCE needed JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS .
Well , rather than march THAT DAY HE LEFT US , ALL THE GLORY AND THE JOY OF THIS CLIMACTIC MOMENT OF CHALLENGING THE SYSTEM , BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE , AND HE LEFT AND WENT TO HIS SICK SISTER .
Now THAT DAY HE LEFT US , ALL THE GLORY AND THE JOY OF THIS CLIMACTIC MOMENT OF CHALLENGING THE SYSTEM , BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE , AND HE LEFT AND WENT TO HIS SICK SISTER was integrity .
THAT DAY HE LEFT US , ALL THE GLORY AND THE JOY OF THIS CLIMACTIC MOMENT OF CHALLENGING THE SYSTEM , BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE , AND HE LEFT AND WENT TO HIS SICK SISTER was sacrifice .
JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS could have gone up there and gotten into THE GLORY and the fun of THE GLORY , but JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS and to miss THE GLORY all because JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS loved HIS FAMILY and HIS FAMILY was more important than sharing the glory of a group of people who were going up there to march .
Tell IT ALL , BUT HE AND TO MISS IT ALL BECAUSE HE LOVED HIS FAMILY A LITTLE about A LITTLE .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'll never forget IT ALL , BUT HE AND TO MISS IT ALL BECAUSE HE LOVED HIS FAMILY .
So WE went up there .
WE marched .
LEGISLATORS came out on the street , met WE out there in UP FRONT .
LEGISLATORS said , `` WE 'll do so-and-so . ''
LEGISLATORS said , `` WE 'll give LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD THOSE TWO Blacks and THOSE TWO Indians on THE SCHOOL BOARD RIGHT AWAY . ''
And LEGISLATORS did .
AN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY DEVELOPER OF THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH went on A MR. OXENDINE , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM forget who THE OTHERS were , but WE got FOUR ethnic people on THE SCHOOL BOARD RIGHT AWAY as a consequence of that march that day .
FOUR was FOUR .
So , anyway , during those early 70s only did these things happen , and then finally WE went to THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS , as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know , WE continued to press .
WE did n't stop there until WE got stricken THE DOUBLE VOTING FINALLY so that no longer could persons in these charter city units vote for the county school system .
WE was sent down from THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS in Richmond , Virginia , remanded back to the legislature of NORTH CAROLINA , and that issue was resolved .
During all this time WE also had in about ' 74 , WE had a referendum on merger .
MR. DANFORD DIAL told REVEREND BOB MANGUM , MR. DANFORD DIAL said , `` If LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 'll come to THE COMMISSIONERS , and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 'll make THE WAY IT WAS , '' REVEREND BOB MANGUM think THE WAY IT WAS 's THE WAY IT WAS , so WE urged that THE COMMISSIONERS authorize A REFERENDUM .
So A REFERENDUM was authorized , and WE lost , 10,000 TO 5,000 .
But A REFERENDUM got before OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE was far better than being separated in FIVE or SIX different systems .
Then , of course , back in THE EARLY '60S , LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know , there were also the Smilings , and the poor Smilings were in ANOTHER LITTLE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
There was actually four-way segregation in '58 when REVEREND BOB MANGUM came to ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT .
So , REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've just rambled , but wow , what a story of GODLY PEOPLE , MANY OF THEM PRAYER MEETING PEOPLE , WHO UNDERSTOOD AT THAT time that the call of YOUR GOD was to stand up for what was right and fair , and to challenge the systems of denial .
And to cry out , and to believe that GODLY PEOPLE , MANY OF THEM PRAYER MEETING PEOPLE , WHO UNDERSTOOD AT THAT could have THEIR RIGHTS as Americans and GODLY PEOPLE , MANY OF THEM PRAYER MEETING PEOPLE , WHO UNDERSTOOD AT THAT could be whatever GODLY PEOPLE , MANY OF THEM PRAYER MEETING PEOPLE , WHO UNDERSTOOD AT THAT wanted to be like any other American , and that GODLY PEOPLE , MANY OF THEM PRAYER MEETING PEOPLE , WHO UNDERSTOOD AT THAT could break THE SYSTEMS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE 'S LIVES .
Tell THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MERGER EFFORT IN '74 because it seems like YOU all were way ahead of YOU time to conceive of '74 WHEN WE DID THAT .
Who worked for A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MERGER EFFORT IN '74 , and what was the inspiration of A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MERGER EFFORT IN '74 , THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION mean , especially so soon off of THE DOUBLE VOTING FINALLY ?
Well , A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MERGER EFFORT IN '74 was concurrent with the double voting time .
Yeah .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM may have to look back and see , but REVEREND BOB MANGUM think it was '74 WHEN WE DID THAT .
Well , WE were working to alter and to correct an injustice of double voting .
WE was always wrong , always would be , and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD can imagine the kinds of feelings that came out of A DIFFERENT DAY and all kinds of foolish things about , `` WE pay taxes , etc. , etc. ''
A DIFFERENT DAY was so unfortunate .
So many people thought that A DIFFERENT DAY was right , it was actually right and just to have double voting .
Anyway , probably , REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't remember THE ORIGIN except that anybody knew that FIVE or SIX administrative units was duplicating expenses , duplicating administration , reducing the effect of a dollar for DEXTER .
THE ORIGIN was n't sensible , and THE ORIGIN was divisive .
THE ORIGIN continued to give community division , racial division .
THE ORIGIN fostered division .
So REVEREND BOB MANGUM guess it was just A PART OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ULTIMATELY BREAKING DOUBLE VOTING WAS N'T WHAT WAS NEEDED .
A PART OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ULTIMATELY BREAKING DOUBLE VOTING WAS N'T WHAT WAS NEEDED was to bring the whole system together as ONE system , and ONE was what was needed for THIS COUNTY THAT HAVE PROVEN WELL WITHOUT UNIONS .
So REVEREND BOB MANGUM guess LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD shoot for the highest goals as well as work hard for a lower goal , and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD accomplish what LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD can at what level LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD can and continue to move toward what is ultimate .
And so it was timely to get THIS ULTIMATE CONCERN before US because US 's where US needed to go .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM think THIS ULTIMATE CONCERN was just THIS ULTIMATE CONCERN that if THE PEOPLE WE NEED TO BE IN ROBESON COUNTY are really THE PEOPLE WE NEED TO BE IN ROBESON COUNTY US need to work together .
UM-HUM .
Right .
And as A CHRISTIAN LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD want to break down barriers .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD want PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS to respect each other , and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD want PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS to related to each other based on respect for THEIR RIGHTS , and the dignity , and NO POWER OVER ME , and the resources of each other , not on accommodation .
Accommodation is paternalism , and so to empower PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS is to give reconciliation , is to provide community based on respect for THEIR RIGHTS , and for the contributions , and for the potential of each other .
And SO A UNIFIED , merged system was ultimately the way to do SO A UNIFIED .
Right .
SO A UNIFIED fit in with THAT VISION .
What were SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES to that proposal at '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED ?
Of merger ?
Well , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think that there were probably Native Americans that felt it was unnecessary , that the main thing was to get the monkey off SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES backs so that SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES could determine SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES own election system .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM mean OUR OWN BOARD OF EDUCATION , and have AUTHORITY TO RULE AND TO LEAD OUR OWN BOARD OF EDUCATION .
So REVEREND BOB MANGUM think there were some of OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE that probably felt that THE BOARD OF EDUCATION was not timely or unnecessary .
But REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't remember right now the different aspects of resistance .
As LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD see , by A 10,000 TO 5,000 VOTE SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES got a lot of Indian and a lot of Black votes to make A 10,000 TO 5,000 VOTE possible .
But REVEREND BOB MANGUM would say SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES had few if any real resistance from NATIVE PEOPLE , OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS or from BLACK PEOPLE EMPOWERED ALSO , BUT PARTICULARLY .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM would say SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES major resistance came from PAINFUL DAYS in power .
But REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't remember now the arguments that were used against merger .
But REVEREND BOB MANGUM was thrilled when finally in about '88 SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES did have complete merger of THE SYSTEMS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE 'S LIVES and have the A FIRST THE NATIVE AMERICAN superintendent of schools in the history of the state of North Carolina of a multi-cultural system , so that was a great plus .
During '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED , REVEREND BOB MANGUM ran for THE SCHOOL BOARD RIGHT AWAY and became a member of THE SCHOOL BOARD RIGHT AWAY for about FOUR YEARS .
Then when REVEREND BOB MANGUM went to PROSPECT CHURCH as pastor REVEREND BOB MANGUM felt PROSPECT CHURCH was too close PROSPECT CHURCH there that REVEREND BOB MANGUM felt for REVEREND BOB MANGUM to be REVEREND BOB MANGUM that REVEREND BOB MANGUM could be REVEREND BOB MANGUM did n't need to remain on THE SCHOOL BOARD RIGHT AWAY and serve that local church , so REVEREND BOB MANGUM resigned from THE SCHOOL BOARD RIGHT AWAY when REVEREND BOB MANGUM became PASTOR OF FIRST UNITED METHODIST CHURCH IN PEMBROKE .
So YOU priority was ministering .
Ministering to that local community and to that church which is a large church , as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know , the largest THE NATIVE AMERICAN church in THE NATION IN OUR METHODIST CONNECTION .
Right .
Describe that tension A LITTLE BIT , what YOU saw as the kind of conflicts YOU would have come up against , and how A LITTLE BIT was playing out .
Well , REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'll not mention any names , but OUR had TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP in THAT LOCAL SCHOOL THAT WERE PART OF THE CHURCH , and OUR had ITS TENSIONS over THE SCHOOL THAT CHALLENGED THE KIDS TO BE ALL THAT THEY COULD BE and A DIFFERENT DAY .
THAT LOCAL SCHOOL THAT WERE PART OF THE CHURCH would have just made THAT LOCAL SCHOOL THAT WERE PART OF THE CHURCH difficult for REVEREND BOB MANGUM as a school board member who has to make THOSE DECISIONS , but sometimes fall to THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE or to the left of an issue .
THAT LOCAL SCHOOL THAT WERE PART OF THE CHURCH put REVEREND BOB MANGUM in a position where REVEREND BOB MANGUM could have PART OF THE CONGREGATION CHEERING AND CELEBRATING , and PART OF THE CONGREGATION CHEERING AND CELEBRATING angry as fire because REVEREND BOB MANGUM may have voted THE WAY TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP did n't want REVEREND BOB MANGUM to vote .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM just felt that before it was n't A MAJOR ISSUE BECAUSE WE DID N'T HAVE A SCHOOL RIGHT next to A NEW DAY .
OUR did n't have people who were in the church that belonged to THAT LOCAL SCHOOL THAT WERE PART OF THE CHURCH either as TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP , or THE EMPLOYEES , or administrators .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM just felt that to fulfill REVEREND BOB MANGUM calling A FIRST as a pastor of A NEW DAY , OUR had others on AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THAT BOARD now , OUR had Native Americans on AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THAT BOARD .
A NEW DAY was A NEW DAY .
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THAT BOARD was beginning to open up because of THE VOTER REGISTRATION , because of open elections now , and because of the process of breaking double voting .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM went there because REVEREND BOB MANGUM thought REVEREND BOB MANGUM was needed and REVEREND BOB MANGUM could give A VOICE for THE NATIVE AMERICAN , and for THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN , and for the white community in THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM felt for THE COUNTY SYSTEM that it was important to go on AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THAT BOARD , and to take A VOICE to AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THAT BOARD in ' 74 .
By '78 '78 was not that necessary , and so REVEREND BOB MANGUM did n't feel like REVEREND BOB MANGUM was backing off from any major justice concern at the school level that was more important than being AN EFFECTIVE PASTOR AT A CHURCH .
THAT CHURCH THAT WERE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT-ORIENTED had ITS TENSIONS and VARIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTY , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM staying on the school board REVEREND BOB MANGUM felt would just contribute to tension and division .
UM-HUM .
Talk about PROSPECT CHURCH A LITTLE BIT more generally , because as YOU know PROSPECT CHURCH 's an important area for HER INDIAN PEOPLE as A WHOLE , politically , socially , religiously .
A LOT OF US sort of kinship-wise emerge from there , and A LOT OF US have A DIFFERENT DAY as part of US family backgrounds or as part of US spiritual , religious backgrounds .
So many people have worked or attended that school .
THE MOOD OF PROSPECT seemed to-I do n't know if THE MOOD OF PROSPECT was typical .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION guess THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION 'm asking , was the mood of Prospect in the 1970s typical or atypical , do YOU think , of the Indian community as A WHOLE , and could YOU talk A LITTLE BIT about what A LITTLE BIT was like to work there as someone who was working on behalf of NATIVE PEOPLE , OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS , but also had the kind of responsibilities YOU had to be fair , to make THOSE DECISIONS ?
PROSPECT CHURCH , REVEREND BOB MANGUM admired A NEW DAY and INDIAN PEOPLE , BLACK PEOPLE because SO MANY had A STRONG SENSE OF COMMITMENT to social justice , and SO MANY wanted to see change in THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY , because SO MANY owned land , because SO MANY had relationships to EACH OTHER and numbers are important .
There was a lot of confidence in A DIFFERENT DAY , a lot of optimism that we can make A DIFFERENCE .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM enjoyed being there because REVEREND BOB MANGUM could see a lot of energy in that community for change and for improvement in THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM worked very closely with ADOLPH DIAL , AS YOU KNOW , AND WITH HARBERT , and others in THAT CHURCH THAT WERE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT-ORIENTED .
There were some , of course , in that church as in other churches and other communities that were more status quo-oriented .
Do n't push too far .
Do n't go too far .
There were OTHERS THAT FELT LIKE THOSE WHO WERE PUSHING FOR THE TOTAL EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE WERE GOING TOO SLOW , and there was reaction to those folks that were felt not to go fast enough in change .
So there was a lot of energy in A DIFFERENT DAY .
There 's some that were sort of status quo in OTHERS THAT FELT LIKE THOSE WHO WERE PUSHING FOR THE TOTAL EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE WERE GOING TOO SLOW attitude .
There were some that were , `` let 'S go for the long haul , and let 'S alter and empower PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS , and change THE SYSTEMS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE 'S LIVES . ''
And then there were others that , `` let 'S have 'S OUR WAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE . ''
`` Let 'S get 'S done , and OTHERS OF YOU are too slow , and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're not doing what LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD ought to be doing . ''
So in terms of THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY , THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY had all facets of energy .
But there was that energy that would produce a tremendous volunteer fire department , whether OTHERS OF YOU related to A NEW DAY or not OTHERS OF YOU were related in helping a little church in SOUTH CAROLINA called HICKORY GROVE IN MARLBORO COUNTY .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD had A SCHOOL THAT WAS PRODUCING PROFESSIONALS , DOCTORS , LAWYERS WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON EXCELLENCE .
And whatever LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD say about Mr. JAMES ARTHUR JONES , JAMES ARTHUR JONES worked OUR SOCKS off to have JAMES ARTHUR JONES teachers and have JAMES ARTHUR JONES students believe that TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP were somebody , and that TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP could produce , and that TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP could contribute .
And that A SCHOOL THAT WAS PRODUCING PROFESSIONALS , DOCTORS , LAWYERS WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON EXCELLENCE did n't matter whether TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP were from PROSPECT CHURCH or where TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP were from , TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP were responsible to be THE BEST THEY COULD BE .
So LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD had a lot that excelled .
MR. DANFORD DIAL , MR. DANFORD DIAL caused STUDENTS THAT RELATED TO THE LUMBER RIVER METHODIST HOLINESS CONFERENCE WHICH INCLUDED JAMES WOODS to believe that STUDENTS THAT RELATED TO THE LUMBER RIVER METHODIST HOLINESS CONFERENCE WHICH INCLUDED JAMES WOODS could be THE BEST THEY COULD BE .
So there were THESE STRONG LEADERS IN THE SCHOOL THAT CHALLENGED THE KIDS TO BE ALL THAT THEY COULD BE .
And then , of course , there were PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT DO THAT AND WOULD SOMEHOW DISCOURAGE STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND SO FORTH , WOULD SAY DISPARAGING THINGS .
`` Well , LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD , from HIS FAMILY .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're daddy was n't anything .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're not going to be anything . ''
THOSE THINGS happen , too , in OUR NATIVE COMMUNITIES .
But REVEREND BOB MANGUM liked THE SIGNIFICANT FACT that there were PUSHERS there in that school in leadership that were continuing to say in the way PUSHERS operated , `` LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're somebody .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD can be THE BEST THEY COULD BE , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm challenging LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD to be all that LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD can be . ''
So THE BEST THEY COULD BE was good in THE SCHOOL THAT CHALLENGED THE KIDS TO BE ALL THAT THEY COULD BE .
THAT KIND OF STRONG , directive leadership caused PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS , did n't like to abide by tough rules about how to use the school property , etc. , and that caused tension in A DIFFERENT DAY , but ANOTHER LITTLE SCHOOL SYSTEM produced .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 've got to admit THAT KIND OF STRONG .
PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS produced kids that wanted to be all PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS could be and to achieve .
And to come out of very moderate economic circumstances of MANY PROSPECT KIDS , there probably is n't a better story of achievement , of student achievement , than THAT LOCAL SCHOOL THAT WERE PART OF THE CHURCH .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM was not speaking disparagingly of any other community .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM was impressed with A DIFFERENT DAY .
MANY PROSPECT KIDS wanted REVEREND BOB MANGUM to come there .
MANY PROSPECT KIDS got criticized because MANY PROSPECT KIDS asked A NON-INDIAN to come be MANY PROSPECT KIDS pastor , but A NON-INDIAN was A NON-INDIAN , and at '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED REVEREND BOB MANGUM did n't feel REVEREND BOB MANGUM was being paternalistic to respond to MANY PROSPECT KIDS .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM felt REVEREND BOB MANGUM was being REVEREND BOB MANGUM .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM felt THE WHOLE SOCIAL CALLING OF THAT TIME TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE AND EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE was right .
Why do YOU think PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS chose YOU ?
Well , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think PEOPLE WHO WANTED PERHAPS SOME CONCESSIONS chose REVEREND BOB MANGUM because REVEREND BOB MANGUM had proven that REVEREND BOB MANGUM could be trusted .
HER INDIAN PEOPLE knew that REVEREND BOB MANGUM was HER INDIAN PEOPLE friend , and that REVEREND BOB MANGUM was n't REVEREND BOB MANGUM better .
Whatever REVEREND BOB MANGUM asked or expected of OTHERS , REVEREND BOB MANGUM was willing to demonstrate REVEREND BOB MANGUM .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'd been there to preach , and OTHERS knew something about REVEREND BOB MANGUM , and OTHERS trusted REVEREND BOB MANGUM , so OTHERS felt that REVEREND BOB MANGUM could be OTHERS friend in ministry and OTHERS friend in struggle .
Would YOU want to talk a little bit about the emergence of the TUSCARORA organization at '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION know some of OTHERS activity centered on THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE before YOU would have been pastor there .
Before REVEREND BOB MANGUM was there MR. DANFORD DIAL was MR. DANFORD DIAL , and PAINFUL DAYS were PAINFUL DAYS .
Of course , SOME OF THAT LEADERSHIP was also participating in THE LIFE OF PROSPECT , too .
SOME OF THAT LEADERSHIP 's what REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm saying , that there were THEIR ENERGIES .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM was not in A DIFFERENT DAY then , but PAINFUL DAYS were times of real tension , as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know .
Whenever LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD get emotions enflamed A DIFFERENT DAY 's very difficult to reason , so PAINFUL DAYS were TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WERE HAVING THEIR HOPES RAISED BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING FOR ETHNIC PEOPLE , and PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT DO THAT AND WOULD SOMEHOW DISCOURAGE STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND SO FORTH , WOULD SAY DISPARAGING THINGS have been overlooked , and PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT DO THAT AND WOULD SOMEHOW DISCOURAGE STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND SO FORTH , WOULD SAY DISPARAGING THINGS have not been treated with dignity and respect .
Often rather than engendering positive emotions of gathering together and being all that WE can be together to make THE CHANGES , WE just become very angry and lose WE sense , sometimes , of direction .
And fail to think through WHAT WE 'RE DOING AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT WE 'RE DOING , and what effect A STRONG SENSE OF COMMITMENT will have on THE CHANGES WE really want .
So out of frustration REVEREND BOB MANGUM think PEOPLE WHO HAVE FELT DENIED THROUGH POVERTY AS WELL AS THROUGH ETHNICITY , THROUGH VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DENIAL THEY JUST SORT OF EXPLODED FOR A WHILE .
As LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know there were FIRES BACK then , and WE never did know just exactly where PEOPLE WHO HAVE FELT DENIED THROUGH POVERTY AS WELL AS THROUGH ETHNICITY , THROUGH VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DENIAL THEY JUST SORT OF EXPLODED FOR A WHILE came from .
AIM came here for awhile .
Here WE go .
Explosive and DANGEROUS TIMES .
DANGEROUS TIMES .
But REVEREND BOB MANGUM want to commend PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS for , no matter what mistakes may have been made in confrontation during '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED , commend PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS for getting excited about what PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS believed would be better , and then to respect and be thankful for PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS , or had to defend the institution when it was n't understood that LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD do n't make THE CHANGES over night , that there have to be certain rules that LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD abide by .
So here WE had TWO INDIANS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD RIGHT AWAY fighting Indians in a sense in those confrontations .
WE was very unfortunate .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM also commend the restraint of whites in authority during some of those tense times .
Had there been LESS RESTRAINT and more authoritarian resistance and reaction to some of those days of tension LESS RESTRAINT would have been horrible what may have happened .
So WE have to commend , even though WE felt that there was such denial of NATIVE PEOPLE , OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS through the systems of ONE DAY , there are people that were in power that WE have to appreciate because of NATIVE PEOPLE , OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS restraint in trying to deal with , and reconcile , and negotiate with resistance , strong resistance efforts , and strong aggressive efforts during those days that were often what WE would call civil injustice or civil disobedience is what WE would call ONE DAY .
There were some felonies , as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know .
The burnings of SAVE OLD MAIN .
THE OLD MAIN SITUATION , that was a great rally point for 11,400 NATIVE AMERICANS , THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION .
THE OLD MAIN SITUATION was THE OLD MAIN SITUATION .
THE OLD MAIN SITUATION was Holshouser , REVEREND BOB MANGUM believe , the governor who was sympathetic and caring at '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED .
THE OLD MAIN SITUATION was just good .
Bad that THE OLD MAIN SITUATION burned , but it was good that SO MANY rallied around A MAJOR ISSUE BECAUSE WE DID N'T HAVE A SCHOOL RIGHT .
As SO MANY began to bring some closure and SOME COMMITMENTS THAT SOMETHING WOULD BE DONE , A MR. OXENDINE was seize upon THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM said , `` Look , let 'S come together and work together to break double voting . ''
So those THOSE TWO ladies and REVEREND BOB MANGUM , we brought together a group at JANIE MAYNOR LOCKLEAR 'S DAD 'S home , THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION .
MR. THEODORE .
MR. THEODORE .
MR. THEODORE and MISS ELIZABETH 'S home , and now THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION lived there , REVEREND BOB MANGUM guess , with MISS ELIZABETH 'S husband , JACKIE .
JACKIE ?
NICKY , YEAH . .
NICKY , YEAH . .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM forget .
NICKY , YEAH . .
NICKY , YEAH .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM think MISS ELIZABETH 'S HOME was THEIR home A MR. OXENDINE , not HER dad 's home .
THEIR were living there then .
So WE brought together in HER living room a group of people , MR. DANFORD DIAL , who was now MR. WILLIE LOCKLEAR FROM THE ASHPOLE COMMUNITY .
WE was back in the early seventies and said , `` Let 'S go for 'S .
Let WE develop a strategy to break double voting . ''
During '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED THE VOTER REGISTRATION was going on .
PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS were getting empowered .
So '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED was '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED , there in HER LIVING ROOM .
After the success of saving SAVE OLD MAIN .
Yeah .
After Old SAVE OLD MAIN had been saved , essentially , and brought THEIR ENERGIES then into this new direction .
If THEY PERSONAL ? TO WHAT EXTENT WERE THEY CLASS ORIENTED ? could go back A MINUTE .
Part of what THEY PERSONAL ? TO WHAT EXTENT WERE THEY CLASS ORIENTED ? 're trying to get at in this process of doing these interviews is understanding the nature of THOSE DIVISIONS .
So when YOU said A MINUTE ago , `` Indians fighting Indians , '' A MINUTE struck THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION as an important , sensitive for sure , and an important point to kind of try to characterize a little bit what those disputes were about .
To what extent were THEY PERSONAL ? TO WHAT EXTENT WERE THEY CLASS ORIENTED ? To what extent did ETHNIC GROUPS have to do with different visions of THE FUTURE or different versions of THE PAST ? Do YOU sort of understand what THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION 'm asking ?
Not exactly .
THE FUTURE kind of sounds like from what YOU 've described so far there was this period of tension that came to a resolution where PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS were somewhat coming together around double voting , but before THE FUTURE , THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION mean PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS came together to a certain extent in SAVE OLD MAIN and to a certain extent in double voting , before that though there was somewhat of a-I 'm just THE FUTURE .
THE LATE '60S .
Yeah , THE LATE '60S .
Since YOU were here at '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED , to the extent that YOU can recollect , tell us what THOSE DIVISIONS were about .
And as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD can tell , REVEREND BOB MANGUM was busy .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM was pastoring all the time .
In fact , FROM '69 ON I pastored a local church and also directed THE -LSB- ROBESON COUNTY -RSB- CHURCH AND COMMUNITY CENTER .
So from FROM '69 ON I on until '76 REVEREND BOB MANGUM was doing both .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM was deeply engrossed in the commitment of getting moneys and empowering PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS through THE VOTER REGISTRATION , dealing with THE DOUBLE VOTING ISSUE , dealing with the merger issues and getting that vote before INDIAN PEOPLE , BLACK PEOPLE .
Then dealing with employment issues .
In '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED REVEREND BOB MANGUM was REVEREND BOB MANGUM to the United States Commission on CIVIL RIGHTS , BRENDA , ADOLPH DIAL , AND I. BRENDA BREWINGTON BROOKS , AND ADOLPH DIAL , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM were members of the commission advisory committee .
Then we brought in ABOUT '72 A HEARING ON POLITICAL AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES in ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT .
At that time in ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT seventy-four percent of THE EMPLOYMENT IN ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT , was white .
There was not ONE NATIVE AMERICAN or THE BLACK , and there were fourteen percent THE BLACKS and twelve percent Indians in THE EMPLOYMENT IN ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT , back in about ' 72 .
From ONE NATIVE AMERICAN came BEN FLOYD WHO TOOK ON A SECRETARY IN HIS OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF THE COURT , and then finally THE COMMISSIONERS voted a split vote and put PETE JACOBS in as the director of THE TAX DEPARTMENT OF THE COUNTY .
BEN FLOYD WHO TOOK ON A SECRETARY IN HIS OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF THE COURT was BEN FLOYD WHO TOOK ON A SECRETARY IN HIS OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF THE COURT , to REVEREND BOB MANGUM knowledge , in the history of Robeson County in ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT .
Now all this was happening also during that period from '70 to '76 along in there .
Interesting aside .
A GOOD FRIEND OF OURS , HOWARD COOPER , was A GOOD FRIEND OF OURS , HOWARD COOPER , and for PETE JACOBS to become the director of the tax division , whatever the title was of THE TAX DEPARTMENT OF THE COUNTY , THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY WHO WERE EIGHTY PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN was split .
JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS broke the tie in favor of PETE JACOBS .
JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS lost the next election .
There was a price to pay for being courageous and doing what was right .
But the thing that REVEREND BOB MANGUM think was wonderful during those days of change is that there were PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS .
In REVEREND BOB MANGUM THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , THE COMMISSION ON RELIGION AND RACE circles PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS could have had REVEREND BOB MANGUM moved .
There were complaints that were taken to A FORMER DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT .
A FORMER DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT had NO POWER OVER ME at that time because A FORMER DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT was former .
A FORMER DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT was not current .
THEY did n't go to the current ONE and say , `` Move MR. WILLIE LOCKLEAR FROM THE ASHPOLE COMMUNITY . ''
It was interesting that THEY vented .
THEY let ONE be known .
THEY were not supposed to like what was going on .
THEY told THIS GENTLEMAN .
THIS GENTLEMAN met REVEREND BOB MANGUM at AN ANNUAL CONFERENCE and said , `` What are YOU AND THE INDIANS DOING IN ROBESON COUNTY ? '' What REVEREND BOB MANGUM learned was that there were people that down deep in THEIR HEARTS YOU AND THE INDIANS DOING IN ROBESON COUNTY knew THOSE THINGS were wrong , that AN ANNUAL CONFERENCE needed to change .
A LEADER OF ANOTHER DENOMINATION said , `` ANOTHER DENOMINATION true , finally , '' A LEADER OF ANOTHER DENOMINATION said , `` OUR heel has been on THEIR NECKS , but OUR do n't want OUR HEEL on OUR necks .
OUR heel has been on THEIR NECKS , but OUR do n't want OUR HEEL on OUR necks . ''
THIS was one of the religious leaders in the CAUCASIAN church .
There were THESE FOLKS THOUGH WHO KNEW WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN , and instead of really fighting to stop THIS THESE FOLKS THOUGH WHO KNEW WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN backed off and let THIS happen .
Even though LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD say , `` THESE FOLKS THOUGH WHO KNEW WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN is n't very courageous , '' THESE FOLKS THOUGH WHO KNEW WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN 's better than fighting and denying A PROCESS that THESE FOLKS THOUGH WHO KNEW WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN could have deferred for months and FOUR YEARS .
But THOSE THINGS began to happen because there were some people that knew that A PROCESS was right .
But in terms of what LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're saying , why were people in opposition to each other ? Well , as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know , the identity issue , the LUMBEE INDIAN identity issue is long standing .
From THE VERY TIME OF THE NAMING OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF ROBESON LUMBEES BACK IN '54 OR SO , ALONG IN THERE , THE VERY TIME OF THE NAMING OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF ROBESON LUMBEES BACK IN '54 OR SO , ALONG IN THERE 's been controversial as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know .
Many Native Americans say , `` No .
JUST A GIVEN NAME .
JUST A GIVEN NAME 's JUST A GIVEN NAME . ''
So TUSCARORA was TUSCARORA .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't know the history of THE TUSCARORA MOVEMENT , but REVEREND BOB MANGUM do know that there has been a lack of unanimity in the support of the Lumbee name over FOUR YEARS .
AS MUCH AS THAT REVEREND BOB MANGUM know .
As there begins to come energy for change there are PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS .
Accommodating to rather than altering and challenging THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY .
As authentic Indian people with an authentic Indian name , maybe WE can make A DIFFERENCE that nobody else has made .
Then with that identification and with national movement and relationships to national energies-and REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't know , REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm just speculating , such as AIM-there came this feeling that WE can make A DIFFERENCE that THE OTHERS are not making , and that WE can get A DIFFERENCE done since THE OTHERS 're not getting A DIFFERENCE done .
THE LATE '60S were TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WERE HAVING THEIR HOPES RAISED BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING FOR ETHNIC PEOPLE .
And A WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN felt like , `` THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO DELIVER THE CHANGE 're THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO DELIVER THE CHANGE , and WE 'll do THE TUSCARORA MOVEMENT WE way , '' and , `` WE ca n't wait on these other guys . ''
REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't know .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD see , REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm at a loss because REVEREND BOB MANGUM was not dealing integrally with THE TUSCARORA MOVEMENT , but just dealing with THE SYMPTOMS OF THE CONSEQUENCES at times of THE TUSCARORA MOVEMENT , but THIS ONE identifies with THE TUSCARORA MOVEMENT right now here in THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY .
A WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN 's very sincere .
A WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN 's A WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN , and wonderful man .
And there are OTHERS , but THIS ONE REVEREND BOB MANGUM particularly know about .
OTHERS 's helpful .
OTHERS definitely helps because THIS ONE 's THE PAST and the present sort of wrapping up together to try to figure out how to solve the problems that everyone was facing .
OTHERS seems important .
THE OTHER LEVEL OF CONFLICT AND AGREEMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN , THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION think , is THE OTHER LEVEL OF CONFLICT AND AGREEMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN to accomplish THOSE THINGS during THIS TIME PERIOD .
From YOU observations , what did PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS work on together ? What did PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS not work on together ? What were SOME OF THE TENSIONS AND AGREEMENTS ?
There came , pragmatically REVEREND BOB MANGUM think , different aspects of cooperation .
For instance , in SOME OF THE TENSIONS AND AGREEMENTS caucuses , SOME OF THE TENSIONS AND AGREEMENTS had A LUMBEE CAUCUS , and SOME OF THE TENSIONS AND AGREEMENTS had A LUMBEE CAUCUS , and PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS were working for political empowerment of PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS .
SOME OF THE TENSIONS AND AGREEMENTS worked hard in SOME OF THE TENSIONS AND AGREEMENTS program from the THE NATIVE AMERICAN caucus .
Let REVEREND BOB MANGUM tell LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD what happened .
After A COUPLE YEARS OF THESE TWO CAUCUSES operating separately PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS came together , THE BLACK and A LUMBEE CAUCUS , to work together under the aegis of THE -LSB- ROBESON COUNTY -RSB- CHURCH AND COMMUNITY CENTER .
PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS came together to do THE VOTER REGISTRATION , and the Reverend Charles McDowell , AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WHO IS NOW BISHOP OF A DENOMINATION THAT HE HAS FOUNDED , and Reverend Dufrene Cummings , THOSE TWO became THE EMPLOYEES for THE VOTER REGISTRATION .
PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS just worked OUR SOCKS off registering FOLKS THAT CAME OUT OF NEW ENGLAND THAT WERE HELPING .
So there PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS were sitting in THE SAME OFFICE , side by side .
Then we worked in the Fairmont community with Joy Johnson and got a lot accomplishment of THE VOTER REGISTRATION .
So there was A LOT OF HELPING , THE BLACKS and Indians helping each other to empower INDIAN PEOPLE , BLACK PEOPLE .
A LOT OF HELPING was beautiful .
A LOT OF HELPING was very beautiful .
And then there were GOOD RELATIONSHIPS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD as we began to get THE BLACKS and Indians that were elected by the populace and not by THE INJUSTICE OF DOUBLE VOTING .
For A NUMBER OF YEARS MAJOR GREENE was MAJOR GREENE .
The majority of THE STUDENTS , SIXTY PERCENT and the majority of the representatives probably on the board at '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED were THE NATIVE AMERICAN .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM mean THE PLURALITY .
THE PLURALITY showed a lot of GOOD RELATIONSHIPS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD .
There were efforts always being made to work together , NATIVE PEOPLE , OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS and THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN people .
There are always OUR DIFFERENCES , and THOSE DIVISIONS , and separations .
ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN RECENT YEARS THAT SAW NATIVE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF ALL RACES ACTUALLY WORKING TOGETHER was ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN RECENT YEARS THAT SAW NATIVE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF ALL RACES ACTUALLY WORKING TOGETHER and the establishment of THE PUBLIC DEFENDER PROGRAM .
ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN RECENT YEARS THAT SAW NATIVE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF ALL RACES ACTUALLY WORKING TOGETHER came out of cooperative efforts .
WE established , and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 'll see in these writings that REVEREND BOB MANGUM have here , WE established in about 1980 , ' 4 , ' 5 , or ' 6 , along in there , WE established a justice project for ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT .
HARBERT AND I were HARBERT AND I .
Out of that there came the strong cry for a more JUST COURT SYSTEM AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER became a consequence of COURT SYSTEM .
WE rallied .
WE labored for WE .
WE caucused for THAT IN RALEIGH , but THAT IN RALEIGH was n't until THE DEATH OF JULIAN -LSB- PIERCE -RSB- that THAT IN RALEIGH was finally given to A DIFFERENT DAY .
Is that right ? So when did YOU start ?
After JULIAN -LSB- PIERCE death .
When did YOU start working on THE DEATH OF JULIAN -LSB- PIERCE ?
THE PUBLIC DEFENDER was -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
WE started working on THE DEATH OF JULIAN -LSB- PIERCE about ' 84 .
Eighty-four .
And JULIAN -LSB- PIERCE was killed in ' 89 ?
EIGHTY-SIX ? REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't know when JULIAN -LSB- PIERCE was killed , but WE worked on EIGHTY-SIX for A NUMBER OF YEARS , and kept working at the legislative level , too , and finally after JULIAN -LSB- PIERCE death THIS was one of the big issues to have a public defender , and EIGHTY-SIX 's one of the things that was made available to THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY .
Then WE worked with THE INDIAN COMMISSION in THOSE LATE '80S and established the Dispute Resolution Center .
Out of bad came some very good things , too , out of THAT HORRIBLE SITUATION .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM think in THE TUSCARORA MOVEMENT , as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know , THIS 're THIS .
Tuscaroras who were COUSINS , OR BROTHERS , or COUSINS , OR BROTHERS .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM think ROBESON LUMBEES 's out of the sense of identity and what gives REVEREND BOB MANGUM more authenticity as AN INDIAN .
Then CONFLICT AND AGREEMENT perhaps came out of the fact of some feeling that OTHERS were too slow and that OTHERS had a better way to get moving on THOSE THINGS .
Then in THE EARLY '70S THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , THE COMMISSION ON RELIGION AND RACE had THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION .
AN INDIAN husband was THE REVEREND HARVEY LOWRY .
MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS was THE FIRST EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LRDA , and for a while MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS had NO MONEY FOR WHAT HE DID , NOR DID DEXTER and so THE PUBLIC DEFENDER PROGRAM for Methodists volunteers , we supplied money for THE SAME OFFICE .
There was some travel .
MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS did n't get a salary , but MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS got a little money for THE SAME OFFICE for travel and for office expenses .
For ABOUT SIX MONTHS MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS was MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS .
ABOUT SIX MONTHS was THE FIRST EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LRDA .
ABOUT SIX MONTHS was about '71 or somewhere along in there .
Do YOU want to talk A LITTLE BIT about the founding of LRDA , what YOU remember about that happening and how A LITTLE BIT came about ?
REVEREND BOB MANGUM was invited to be a part of the conversations in the initiating energies , but because REVEREND BOB MANGUM was not THE NATIVE AMERICAN REVEREND BOB MANGUM was not invited to be a part of AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THAT BOARD , but REVEREND BOB MANGUM got a chance to participate in the beginnings , BRUCE JONES , and ROBERT JONES , and MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS .
BRUCE JONES was on the A FIRST board , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS , and HERMAN , AND ADOLPH .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM hate to mention , REVEREND BOB MANGUM mean , the names will get LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD in trouble because LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD leave out SO MANY .
But there were so many good people that got involved back then in THAT VISION that WE could empower WE in social programming , particularly .
Do THOSE THINGS in education .
WE were very much a part of encouraging WE and doing what WE could , and as REVEREND BOB MANGUM said , supporting MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS and having MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS on staff with WE .
THE -LSB- ROBESON COUNTY -RSB- CHURCH AND COMMUNITY CENTER was spun off .
THE -LSB- ROBESON COUNTY -RSB- CHURCH AND COMMUNITY CENTER got started in ' 69 .
MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS was actually A PART OF OUR ADJUNCT STAFF IN THE EARLY '70S because of being MISS VERA , BROTHER SIMEON CUMMINGS .
A PART OF OUR ADJUNCT STAFF IN THE EARLY '70S was exciting .
Helen Scheirbeck , and there were others involved in LRDA , but it was exciting to see this new opportunity for 11,400 NATIVE AMERICANS to have monies for programming .
ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS was ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS .
One of my heroes is THE REVEREND JAMES WOODS .
JAMES is JAMES .
JAMES 's so unselfish .
Here they were getting NO JOBS .
JAMES was JAMES , and then JAMES became A COMMUNITY OUTREACH WORKER with THE SCHOOLS up at Magnolia .
Eventually JAMES resigned and just became full-time pastor .
JAMES church paid JUST A VERY SMALL SALARY FOR FULL-TIME PASTOR , but JUST A VERY SMALL SALARY FOR FULL-TIME PASTOR 's JUST A VERY SMALL SALARY FOR FULL-TIME PASTOR .
JAMES 's been JAMES .
ONE OF HIS PASSIONS , AND OTHERS , was ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS , to get THESE DOCTORS , to get THESE DOCTORS , to get THESE ENGINEERS , THESE ENGINEERS .
ONE OF HIS PASSIONS , AND OTHERS was one of the greatest things that ever happened to OUR community .
Probably OUR have a higher percentage of THESE DOCTORS , THESE DOCTORS , and other professionals of any Indian community in THE UNITED STATES .
THE UNITED STATES was fantastic , the birth of professions .
Then there came economic self-determination .
ADOLPH began to buy up land and to make a shopping center .
Then ADOLPH , and JUDGE DEXTER BROOKS , and ROBERT JONES and others building a bank , A FIRST Indian bank .
This was all early '70s , just the explosion of empowerment .
Whatever MY DREAM was , REVEREND BOB MANGUM can climb the mountain , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM can get there if REVEREND BOB MANGUM work at MY DREAM , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM trust YOUR GOD to help REVEREND BOB MANGUM , and give PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS WERE FEELING THAT THE LUMBEE COMMUNITY WAS MORE ACCOMMODATING THAN CHALLENGING THE SYSTEMS an opportunity .
We 'll get there .
MY DREAM 's amazing what happened in just a few years .
MY DREAM 's right .
MY DREAM really is .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm proud of THIS COMMUNITY , THIS CHRISTIAN FORUM .
WE 've still got WE warts .
THIS COMMUNITY , THIS CHRISTIAN FORUM pains me when WE cancel out each other when WE could do so much better than WE do at TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WERE HAVING THEIR HOPES RAISED BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING FOR ETHNIC PEOPLE .
THIS COMMUNITY , THIS CHRISTIAN FORUM pains REVEREND BOB MANGUM when Indians act like THE DOMINANT RACE and treat each other like they have been treated .
IT PAINS ME WHEN WE CANCEL OUT EACH OTHER WHEN WE COULD DO SO MUCH BETTER THAN WE DO AT TIMES . , but THIS COMMUNITY , THIS CHRISTIAN FORUM 's THIS COMMUNITY , THIS CHRISTIAN FORUM .
When WE 're given power and privilege WE EITHER ACT in altruistic ways to see that justice and CIVIL RIGHTS , BRENDA , ADOLPH DIAL , AND I. BRENDA BREWINGTON BROOKS , AND ADOLPH DIAL are bestowed on others , or WE act selfishly .
WE always brings about injustice , and discrimination , and denial .
HER INDIAN PEOPLE are no better than anyone else .
HER INDIAN PEOPLE , too , have to guard against injustice , and often EITHER ACT 's perpetrated against each other .
But REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm proud of HER INDIAN PEOPLE .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm proud of THIS COUNTY THAT HAVE PROVEN WELL WITHOUT UNIONS .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM came back .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM was in the mountains , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM was asked to serve THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD as a retired pastor , to serve THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH , THE COMMISSION ON RELIGION AND RACE there .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM have n't told everybody about THIS , but REVEREND BOB MANGUM was asked to be the associate pastor in the biggest church in THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY .
THIS would have been a great middle class retirement opportunity , but REVEREND BOB MANGUM wanted to come home .
THIS is home .
THIS is where MANY PROSPECT KIDS grew up , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM have Lumbee grandchildren , as LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM had to come home , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM wife agreed .
WE had to come home because WE felt that WE still could make A CONTRIBUTION .
And WE 've tried since REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've been back .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've tried to make A CONTRIBUTION .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm proud of all of our people in THIS COUNTY THAT HAVE PROVEN WELL WITHOUT UNIONS .
Now WE have a Hispanic community that 's growing .
WE have to prove as Indians , and THE BLACKS , and WHITES WHO 'VE BEEN HERE ALL THESE YEARS , and WE 're working out WE differences , WE 're trying to eliminate THE RACISM , AND THE BIGOTRY , and THE DENIAL .
Now WE have another ethnic group , and WE have to show compassion and a commitment to THE TOTAL EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE so that HER INDIAN PEOPLE can have as much dignity and pride in being a Robesonian as anybody else .
WE can never take for granted .
There 's always THE STRUGGLE , and WE must always be on guard to challenge THE RACISM , AND THE BIGOTRY and denial , whenever it appears , regardless of what color THE RACISM , AND THE BIGOTRY is .
If 11,400 NATIVE AMERICANS are mistreating other races and mistreating EACH OTHER , EACH OTHER 's just as wrong as INDIAN PEOPLE , BLACK PEOPLE mistreating other people .
So WE always have to remind WE of WE need to follow THE MASTER , and to understand that THE MASTER cared about everyone , and THE MASTER came to help WE understand THAT HIS LIFE , AND DEATH , and resurrection was so that there would be neither GREEK NOR JEW , MALE OR FEMALE , GREEK NOR JEW , MALE OR FEMALE , but all could be one in CHRIST .
THE WHOLE SOCIAL CALLING OF THAT TIME TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE AND EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE was THE MASTER calling , and THE WHOLE SOCIAL CALLING OF THAT TIME TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE AND EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE 's REVEREND BOB MANGUM calling .
THE WHOLE SOCIAL CALLING OF THAT TIME TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE AND EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE 's WE calling , and THAT HIS LIFE , AND DEATH 's THAT HIS LIFE , AND DEATH .
WE 've got a lot of VARIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTY .
Education is affected .
Everything 's affected by the drug traffic .
Everything 's affected by LOSS OF JOBS through NAFTA , and the terrible loss of 12,000 or so jobs NAFTA were in SHOE MANUFACTURING , TEXTILES , SHOE MANUFACTURING , TEXTILES .
LOSS OF JOBS 's just so painful .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM and others worked so hard to see PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH , and all of this , and then now to see that PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH have NO JOBS and have little hope of jobs in so many instances .
PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH 's painful .
Are PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH coming to A POINT now like PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH were in the '50s and '60s where THOSE THINGS have got to change and PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH need a social movement to make A POINT change , or can YOU even compare the two moments of crisis ?
Well , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think now WE 're learning to work together .
WE 're pragmatic .
A POINT is n't whether WE learn or not .
WE are working together .
WE 're all in this together .
WE economics are affected by THIS CIRCUMSTANCE .
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE does n't matter what color LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD are .
All of us are dealing with the economics of A DIFFERENT DAY .
WE 're all affected by what is happening right now .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM feel that A DIFFERENT DAY 's A DIFFERENT DAY .
Back in THE EARLY '60S PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH were denied because of THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN , because of THEIR CULTURE .
PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH have always been denied when PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH 're poor and do n't have friends regardless of THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN , but WE 're in a more common circumstance now that affects everybody in a similar way .
WE 're sharing power , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM know WE still have to work at THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN .
WE 're sharing EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES , but now WE economic resources and EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES have diminished to a great extent .
Now WE 're having to rebuild an economic system that will provide for OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE , and provide NO JOBS , and provide the pride that WE can all have because WE can work and WE can have the things that are necessary to life .
There wo n't be an out migration like there used to be , REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't think .
There may be some , but there 's A REASON TO LIVE HERE IN ROBESON NOW , LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM can be that nurse .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM can be that doctor .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM can go to school .
Like ADOLPH HAD TO GO TO BOSTON , TO BOSTON COLLEGE , to get is masters degree because ADOLPH HAD TO GO TO BOSTON , TO BOSTON COLLEGE could n't go to a school in NORTH CAROLINA and get a masters degree .
As A NATIVE AMERICAN THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY would n't allow THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY .
THESE DOORS are all open .
Instead of having a flight REVEREND BOB MANGUM think , hopefully , WE 're going to have more and more energy spent in trying to provide NO JOBS and provide the opportunities WE need for all the people in THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY .
Secondly , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think eventually WE 're going to come to A POINT where WE 're going to work together like WE 've never worked to snuff out AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THIS DRUG TRAFFIC .
Because money is so powerful , and AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THIS DRUG TRAFFIC is so predominant , that WE 're all suffering regardless of WE color in WE culture .
WE 're AL SUFFERING FROM THIS .
All of our families are suffering .
AL SUFFERING FROM THIS 's insidious .
AL SUFFERING FROM THIS 's eroding at WE fiber as a community .
So REVEREND BOB MANGUM think that rather than fighting EACH OTHER there 's more joining of hands , and THEIR HEARTS , and SOME COMMITMENTS THAT SOMETHING WOULD BE DONE to work together to make this the best county EACH OTHER can be .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm REVEREND BOB MANGUM .
YOU have to be to be A CHRISTIAN .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM believe in THY KINGDOM COME ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN , `` THY KINGDOM COME ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN . ''
REVEREND BOB MANGUM rambled all around .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 've been patient with REVEREND BOB MANGUM .
YOU 've done A GREAT JOB .
We 've covered A LOT , actually , in a very short period of '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED .
Yes , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM jump back and forth .
A LOT 's good though .
A LOT 's very good .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION know there 's some things in this outline that may be worth addressing or not , such as the Rural Advancement Fund Justice Project .
Yeah .
WE did n't talk much about this .
WE did n't talk a lot about THOSE LATE '80S .
WE talked some about THOSE LATE '80S .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION do n't know if YOU - ?
Well WE was , in THOSE LATE '80S now LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're beginning in THAT HORRIBLE SITUATION to deal with JUST COURT SYSTEM AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're dealing with THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY , and THE COURT still would n't receive PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH .
And a seeming disregard for A PERSON 'S dignity to come and sit , and sit , and waste a day and not be received into THE COURT not to be held or PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH trial , and people losing NO JOBS because of THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY .
People pleading guilty just to get out of losing A GREAT JOB .
Court-appointed attorneys , some working for very little , did a wonderful job of course , but OTHERS spending little or no time with OTHERS clients for A REASON TO LIVE HERE IN ROBESON NOW , encouraging OTHERS to plead guilty just to get A REASON TO LIVE HERE IN ROBESON NOW over with .
NO MONEY FOR WHAT HE DID , NOR DID DEXTER to do investigation .
Poverty breeds injustice .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't care what color LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD are .
In THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER there was a chance that with a staff THEY could do investigation , THEY could do THEY homework to prove A PERSON 'S was not as guilty as THEY would have been otherwise , or THEY were innocent rather than guilty .
THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER was so important .
THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER was some of what was beginning to happen in THOSE LATE '80S , a dispute resolution center where PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH could get together before PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH had a court issue PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH would opt , and elect , and accept the dispute resolution process rather than litigation in THE COURT .
THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER would save our courts a lot of '70 WHEN SIM WAS DEFEATED , and THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER would bring about an attempt for some kind of reconciliation .
THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER was good .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM do n't think THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER still exists .
THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER was here when REVEREND BOB MANGUM left , but when REVEREND BOB MANGUM came back , REVEREND BOB MANGUM was away for NINE YEARS , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think at some point NINE YEARS dissipated .
But anyway , THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE PUBIC DEFENDER was important .
Birth was given to that during THOSE LATE '80S .
Then there was THE ELECTION OF JULIAN RUNNING FOR OFFICE TO CHALLENGE WHAT HE FELT WAS A PART OF THE REASON FOR THE INJUSTICES IN THE WAY THE COURT WAS ADMINISTERED PROSECUTORIALLY .
THE ELECTION OF JULIAN RUNNING FOR OFFICE TO CHALLENGE WHAT HE FELT WAS A PART OF THE REASON FOR THE INJUSTICES IN THE WAY THE COURT WAS ADMINISTERED PROSECUTORIALLY was THE ELECTION OF JULIAN RUNNING FOR OFFICE TO CHALLENGE WHAT HE FELT WAS A PART OF THE REASON FOR THE INJUSTICES IN THE WAY THE COURT WAS ADMINISTERED PROSECUTORIALLY , REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm sure .
In THOSE LATE '80S THOSE LATE '80S was THOSE LATE '80S so that INDIAN PEOPLE , BLACK PEOPLE were now INDIAN PEOPLE , BLACK PEOPLE .
There were INDIANS AND BLACKS THAT WERE MAKING THIS POSSIBLE FOR WHITES OR FOR OTHER RACES SO NO LONGER WAS IT THE PATERNALISM OF ONE RACE HAVING ALL THE POWER , AND BEING ABLE TO CALL ALL THE SHOTS WHETHER THEY HAD THE OFFICE OR NOT , THEY DICTATED WHAT HAPPENED .
INDIANS AND BLACKS THAT WERE MAKING THIS POSSIBLE FOR WHITES OR FOR OTHER RACES SO NO LONGER WAS IT THE PATERNALISM OF ONE RACE HAVING ALL THE POWER , AND BEING ABLE TO CALL ALL THE SHOTS WHETHER THEY HAD THE OFFICE OR NOT , THEY DICTATED WHAT HAPPENED was gone , and there was new emerging of power of INDIAN PEOPLE , BLACK PEOPLE .
Would YOU say that Indians and THE BLACKS being empowered generally did apportion justice more equally ?
Oh , yeah .
In RALEIGH , yes .
THE BLACKS got involved at the Parkview Housing Authority back in , REVEREND BOB MANGUM guess , THE EARLY '70S .
Housing coming out of the church community .
THE BLACKS were much more directed by A MR. OXENDINE .
In this little thing REVEREND BOB MANGUM wrote , THE BLACKS were more directed in THE BLACKS challenging of political systems .
THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY , if LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're A CHRISTIAN YOU SORT OF LET THINGS RIDE AND LET OTHER PEOPLE take care of the politics , and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD worked for the personal spiritual salvation and personal nurturing and development .
Like one religious leader told REVEREND BOB MANGUM .
A CHRISTIAN YOU SORT OF LET THINGS RIDE AND LET OTHER PEOPLE said , `` LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD ca n't change CITY HALL . ''
Well , REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm here to tell LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD CHRISTIAN , THAT THIS IS GOD 'S WORK , AND THAT WE MUST DO ALL people changed CITY HALL in ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT .
It was GODLY PEOPLE , MANY OF THEM PRAYER MEETING PEOPLE , WHO UNDERSTOOD AT THAT .
It was n't just PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH .
It was PEOPLE OF FAITH THAT WERE COMMITTED , ACROSS ALL THE RACES OF THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY .
So , yes , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think THE NEW EMPOWERMENT has produced positive effects for the whole county .
Of course THE NEW EMPOWERMENT has .
Well , A DIFFERENT PLACE IN MANY WAYS , MANY , MANY WAYS .
Well , it seems A DIFFERENT PLACE IN MANY WAYS , MANY , MANY WAYS 's different even from when REVEREND BOB MANGUM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION did n't grow up here-but visiting here in THE EARLY '70S and THE EARLY '80S , A DIFFERENT PLACE IN MANY WAYS , MANY , MANY WAYS 's A DIFFERENT PLACE IN MANY WAYS , MANY , MANY WAYS .
Sure A DIFFERENT PLACE IN MANY WAYS , MANY , MANY WAYS is .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION was interested in what YOU said about some of the differences between THE INDIAN AND BLACK CHURCH , or LUMBEE INDIAN and AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WHO IS NOW BISHOP OF A DENOMINATION THAT HE HAS FOUNDED .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION think there 's THE PERCEPTION OF THE BLACK CHURCH 'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN VERY DIRECTIVE AND VERY ASSERTIVE POLITICALLY .
Would YOU say THE PERCEPTION OF THE BLACK CHURCH 'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN VERY DIRECTIVE AND VERY ASSERTIVE POLITICALLY was true here in ROBESON COUNTY , THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT as well ?
Of Blacks being-yeah .
Very much so .
There were some THE BLACK leaders that were milking THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY as much as possible without overly challenging THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY , and pragmatism .
There were others that were challenging THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY with more risk , but THE BLACKS essentially have been able to exploit THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY for good , or to challenge and try to change THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED CALENDARING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE CALENDARED TO COME DAY AFTER DAY for good .
OUR Native American people have been doing that too over THE EARLY '60S , THE EARLY '70S , and THE EARLY '80S like REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm saying , but A NEW DAY often has allowed A NEW DAY to happen among Christians coalescing in caucuses rather than a local church being committed .
Now OUR 're coming to the stage with THE HEALING LODGE where OUR are at the point where OUR 're trying to get the whole church to be open , committed , and aggressively engaged in the whole life of the community from the drug issue , to addiction , to STDs , abuse , and all of this , as a part of the CHRISTIAN , THAT THIS IS GOD 'S WORK , AND THAT WE MUST DO ALL conscience and CHRISTIAN , THAT THIS IS GOD 'S WORK , AND THAT WE MUST DO ALL holistic ministry .
OUR 's beginning to happen .
In PAST YEARS one of our major Indian denominations had a vote opposing THE UNIONIZATION OF CONVERSE -LSB- SHOE FACTORY -RSB- , REVEREND BOB MANGUM think PAST YEARS was , PAST YEARS ago .
Well , no matter what LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD believed , if LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD knew THE LABOR MOVEMENT LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD knew THE LABOR MOVEMENT came out of CHRISTIAN , THAT THIS IS GOD 'S WORK , AND THAT WE MUST DO ALL vision , that PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH needed EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES .
As THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD should always want THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD to happen , and if NO UNIONS would help make THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD happen rather than non-union bargaining with LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD employers then AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO BE TREATED WITH GREATER DIGNITY becomes necessary .
THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD may not be THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD , but THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD may be better than exploitation that 's being perpetrated .
NO UNIONS can help a just cause .
In this county where there were NO UNIONS at least as a church LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD do n't want to say , `` WE oppose AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO BE TREATED WITH GREATER DIGNITY , '' because AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO BE TREATED WITH GREATER DIGNITY was AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO BE TREATED WITH GREATER DIGNITY , get BETTER WAGES , etc. , better benefits .
There are a lot of efforts that have been made in THIS COUNTY THAT HAVE PROVEN WELL WITHOUT UNIONS .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM concern is A COMMUNITY OUTREACH WORKER , that A COMMUNITY OUTREACH WORKER get the best opportunity possible to work with dignity and to make as much money as possible related to the type of job that PEOPLE TO GET A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO BE TREATED WITH GREATER DIGNITY 're in compared to the cost of living and compared to THE NATION IN OUR METHODIST CONNECTION .
Typically in SOUTH CAROLINA WE 've been denied , and WE wages have been lower because WE have n't had NO UNIONS , and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know that .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM do , too .
NO UNIONS can be corrupt .
THEY can be as sinful as a snake , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM know that and LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD do too .
But it was disappointing that ONE OF OUR INDIAN DENOMINATIONS had a vote apparently in THEY official meeting that THEY opposed THE UNIONIZATION OF CONVERSE -LSB- SHOE FACTORY -RSB- .
ONE OF OUR INDIAN DENOMINATIONS was MY UNDERSTANDING .
YOU see some movement in a slightly different direction there with THE HEALING LODGE ?
Yeah , yeah .
One of our leaders of a major denomination , a Native leader , said , `` FOLKS THAT CAME OUT OF NEW ENGLAND THAT WERE HELPING , THE CHURCH 'S PROBLEM is A NEW DAY problem , '' when little April SIM OXENDINE and Commander Craig Wilkins came to share with US .
FOLKS THAT CAME OUT OF NEW ENGLAND THAT WERE HELPING came to US at US co-op , and US helped bring together over at THE BAPTIST BUILDING AN ECUMENICAL GROUP OF PEOPLE TO HEAR WHAT THIS TERRIBLE PROBLEM WAS IN ROBESON COUNTY , THIS STD PROBLEM TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO .
One of our THE BAPTIST BUILDING AN ECUMENICAL GROUP OF PEOPLE TO HEAR WHAT THIS TERRIBLE PROBLEM WAS IN ROBESON COUNTY , THIS STD PROBLEM TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO leaders said , `` FOLKS THAT CAME OUT OF NEW ENGLAND THAT WERE HELPING , THE CHURCH 'S PROBLEM is n't someone else 's problem .
THE CHURCH 'S PROBLEM is US problem , and as THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD US must deal with US problem . ''
Boy , THE CHURCH 'S PROBLEM 's a powerful statement .
A NEW DAY is beginning to deal with life as A NEW DAY is , and the ways US can put US love into action to bringing about change for others .
Not just treating THE SYMPTOMS OF THE CONSEQUENCES , but dealing with root causes .
Why are HIS PEOPLE , and what can US do to empower PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH to get out of THE CHURCH 'S PROBLEM ?
REVEREND BOB MANGUM believe in a church that promotes Jesus Christ as THE LORD and Savior , and promotes personal salvation and personal spiritual growth , but REVEREND BOB MANGUM believe in a church that understands that YOUR GOD expects YOUR GOD people to be a people of justice , and of love , and of mercy .
What does THE LORD require of LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD but to do justice and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with YOUR GOD ? To do justice .
LOVE , ` REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'll pray for LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD , ' or ` YOUR GOD bless LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD . ' ''
JOHN said , `` How can LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD expect that LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD ? '' JOHN said , `` LOVE must show LOVE in action , in word .
LOVE must show LOVE in deeds , in action . ''
So REVEREND BOB MANGUM believe wherever A NEW DAY is being A NEW DAY , A NEW DAY 's empowering PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH to care about each other and to care about THE SYSTEMS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE 'S LIVES , and to work to bring about change in THE SYSTEMS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE 'S LIVES , and to bring about redress to PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH circumstances , and to bring service to PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH wherever possible .
Love must show A NEW DAY in action .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM have A LITTLE SAYING THAT PROBABLY I BORROWED AND THEN ADJUSTED IT .
But anyway , love is drawn by opportunity , not driven by obligation , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM think A LITTLE SAYING THAT PROBABLY I BORROWED AND THEN ADJUSTED IT 's where A NEW DAY is .
We have to respond to opportunity .
Well , YOU 've been A LIVING EXAMPLE OF IT .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've tried to be faithful , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've been REVEREND BOB MANGUM .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 'm REVEREND BOB MANGUM .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've been fortunate to be able to align REVEREND BOB MANGUM with PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH , and PEOPLE WHO DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR DID N'T CARE ABOUT THE THINGS OF FAITH , and who are task oriented like REVEREND BOB MANGUM am , and who believe A LIVING EXAMPLE OF IT 's CHRISTIAN , THAT THIS IS GOD 'S WORK , AND THAT WE MUST DO ALL WE can do while WE live to bring about ABOUT CHANGE AND EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE .
A LIVING EXAMPLE OF IT 's A LIVING EXAMPLE OF IT .
There are TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WERE HAVING THEIR HOPES RAISED BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING FOR ETHNIC PEOPLE .
As leader there 's TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WERE HAVING THEIR HOPES RAISED BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING FOR ETHNIC PEOPLE .
There are TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WERE HAVING THEIR HOPES RAISED BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING FOR ETHNIC PEOPLE , but REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've tried never to be a paternalist .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM 've tried to be a partner in THE STRUGGLE , and I continue to try to be a partner .
Thank YOU .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION appreciate THE STRUGGLE .
Thank LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD .
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN COMMISSION hope YOU write YOU book .
Okay .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM just thought YOUR BOOK might be well to tell LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD a little incident .
During THE TIME OF WORKING FOR THE BREAKING OF DOUBLE VOTING AND BRINGING ABOUT A CHANGE IN THE COUNTY ON ONE OCCASION YOU were in a restaurant .
THE TIME OF WORKING FOR THE BREAKING OF DOUBLE VOTING AND BRINGING ABOUT A CHANGE IN THE COUNTY ON ONE OCCASION was a snow A DIFFERENT DAY so TEACHERS AND LEADERSHIP had gotten out early REVEREND BOB MANGUM think ONE DAY .
THE TIME OF WORKING FOR THE BREAKING OF DOUBLE VOTING AND BRINGING ABOUT A CHANGE IN THE COUNTY ON ONE OCCASION was there in PEMBROKE .
MR. DANFORD DIAL , MR. WILLIE LOCKLEAR FROM THE ASHPOLE COMMUNITY , and REVEREND BOB MANGUM were together , and YOU were going to Lumberton for some purpose .
SOME OF THE TEACHERS there said to YOU rather quietly , `` YOU appreciate what 's going on and what 's happening .
YOU ca n't get involved . ''
THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING , `` WE CA N'T GET involved .
LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD know how THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING , `` WE CA N'T GET is , but YOU 're for LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD , and YOU appreciate what 's going on . ''
REVEREND BOB MANGUM think one of my friends that was involved over the years in social change had a teacher come to his back door and say , `` REVEREND BOB MANGUM appreciate what 's going on .
REVEREND BOB MANGUM ca n't get involved , but REVEREND BOB MANGUM thank LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD for what LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD 're doing . ''
So here was a system that had people afraid for THEIR jobs to speak what THEIR believed was right and just .
WE 're Americans .
WE believe in freedom of speech , and here THE RACISM , AND THE BIGOTRY , this denial of PEOPLE OF FAITH THAT WERE COMMITTED , ACROSS ALL THE RACES OF THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY had caused PEOPLE OF FAITH THAT WERE COMMITTED , ACROSS ALL THE RACES OF THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY to be afraid to talk about what PEOPLE OF FAITH THAT WERE COMMITTED , ACROSS ALL THE RACES OF THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY felt was wrong in THIS COUNTY THAT HAVE PROVEN WELL WITHOUT UNIONS because PEOPLE OF FAITH THAT WERE COMMITTED , ACROSS ALL THE RACES OF THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY as THESE DOCTORS would have no opportunity to work in THIS COUNTY THAT HAVE PROVEN WELL WITHOUT UNIONS if THESE DOCTORS went too far in identifying THESE DOCTORS concerns .
PEOPLE OF FAITH THAT WERE COMMITTED , ACROSS ALL THE RACES OF THE COUNTY , THAT WERE COMMITTED TO CHANGE IN THE COUNTY knew that there as A VERY POIGNANT MOMENT to make a living as A TEACHER 'S but to move and go to another county , another state probably more than another county .
A VERY POIGNANT MOMENT was A VERY POIGNANT MOMENT when LOVING PEOPLE WHEN IT 'S JUST IN TONGUE AND IN WORD have PEOPLE OF INTEGRITY AND OF POWER WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIFE OF THEIR STUDENTS , but who live in fear that PEOPLE OF INTEGRITY AND OF POWER WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIFE OF THEIR STUDENTS ca n't say what PEOPLE OF INTEGRITY AND OF POWER WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIFE OF THEIR STUDENTS believe and ca n't share what PEOPLE OF INTEGRITY AND OF POWER WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIFE OF THEIR STUDENTS feel THE TOTAL SOCIAL NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY to be done to bring ABOUT CHANGE AND EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE because PEOPLE OF INTEGRITY AND OF POWER WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIFE OF THEIR STUDENTS may lose A GREAT JOB .
Then WE had THIS CRUEL SYSTEM IN ROBESON for years called THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE .
WE allowed INDIAN PEOPLE , BLACK PEOPLE on THESE SCHOOL COMMITTEES where there were Black schools , where there were Indian schools , THIS CRUEL SYSTEM IN ROBESON allowed THESE SCHOOL COMMITTEES to deal with THE LIVES OF PROFESSIONALS , and to deal with THESE DOCTORS lives in terms of what THESE DOCTORS felt A TEACHER 'S job should be awarded because HIS FAMILY does not have AS MUCH AS THAT - .
