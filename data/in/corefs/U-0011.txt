Okay TAPE 101603-JM is TAPE 101603-JM and TAPE 101603-JM is MR. LACY MAYNOR AS HIS ASSISTANT .
MR. JAMES MOORE just start out , tell us YOUR full name , YOUR birthday , what YOUR address is .
MR. JAMES MOORE am MR. JAMES MOORE .
MR. JAMES MOORE 'm from THE PROSPECT , born and reared at THE PROSPECT .
MR. JAMES MOORE was born August 18th , 1922 , and MR. JAMES MOORE 've lived here .
At THE PRESENT TIME MR. JAMES MOORE 'm living on Highway 711 at PEMBROKE , but MR. JAMES MOORE still consider MR. JAMES MOORE from THE PROSPECT .
MR. JAMES MOORE 've been around now for eighty-one years , and MR. JAMES MOORE 've been a part of and witnessed a lot of the changes that have come about in the county and well , yes , the whole county .
Start with MR. EARLY BULLARD AND THE FORMATION OF THE PROSPECT -
EARLY BULLARD married MR. JAMES MOORE father 's sister Emma , and EARLY BULLARD was EARLY BULLARD .
THIS came about in 1954 .
In 1954 a group of us here at THE PROSPECT , MR. EARLY BULLARD AND THE FORMATION OF THE PROSPECT built a clubhouse on land adjacent to the school property , and MR. EARLY BULLARD AND THE FORMATION OF THE PROSPECT like to give MR. EARLY BULLARD AND THE FORMATION OF THE PROSPECT a lot of credit , not all the credit because EARLY BULLARD became EARLY BULLARD .
1954 was FOUR districts , MAXTON , PEMBROKE and THE PROSPECT , and there 's another one in there .
But anyway , MR. EARLY BULLARD AND THE FORMATION OF THE PROSPECT here at THE PROSPECT like to give THIS a lot of CREDIT FOR HIS ELECTION .
MAXTON was MAXTON .
MR. JAMES MOORE think FIRST came as a surprise to THE WHITE PEOPLE and caught THE WHITE PEOPLE by surprise .
When THIS happened , there was a group in MAXTON , Gus Spero -LSB- s -RSB- , Buddy Dunn and others , THIS took MAXTON , GUS SPERO -LSB- S -RSB- , BUDDY DUNN AND OTHERS by such surprise until MAXTON , GUS SPERO -LSB- S -RSB- , BUDDY DUNN AND OTHERS thought that MAXTON , GUS SPERO -LSB- S -RSB- , BUDDY DUNN AND OTHERS could go to headquarters , to THE DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS IN RALEIGH and do something about THE DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS IN RALEIGH .
After MAXTON became judge , MAXTON appointed MR. LACY MAYNOR AS HIS ASSISTANT .
MR. LACY was MR. LACY .
Naturally MR. JAMES MOORE supported MR. LACY .
MR. JAMES MOORE do n't remember just , MR. JAMES MOORE believe it was TWO terms UNCLE EARLY served , and then UNCLE EARLY gave TWO up and MR. LACY became judge and UNCLE EARLY ran unopposed as long as UNCLE EARLY served .
However , MR. JAMES MOORE believe , MR. JAMES MOORE 'm not certain about THIS , but MR. JAMES MOORE believe that there was A LAW FIXED TO THE EFFECT THAT TO BE A RECORDER 'S COURT JUDGE THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE A LAW DEGREE , AND OF COURSE THAT WAS MADE TO ELIMINATE ANYMORE RECORDER 'S COURT JUDGES .
Then THIS 's about THIS .
Well , go back and tell RECORDER 'S COURT JUDGES a little bit about how YOUR all organized to get UNCLE EARLY elected .
Well , going back to judge , A RECORDER 'S judge , WE organized by roads .
EACH ROAD IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY was assigned to a certain person , and of course WE gave WE a lot of credit , and WE did this by visiting house to house , being assured THE WHITE PEOPLE were registered to vote and being assured if THE WHITE PEOPLE registered that THE WHITE PEOPLE voted on election day .
EACH ROAD IN THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY was carried out well .
MR. JAMES MOORE do n't think WE , after this the elections since ABOUT THEN , WE 've never gone to that extent .
-LSB- coughs -RSB- EXCUSE MR. JAMES MOORE .
But EXCUSE was carried out well , and EXCUSE brought ABOUT THEN after THIS , THIS was in 1954 and by 1960 WE had THE INTEGRATION .
THE SCHOOL here at THE PROSPECT , THE SCHOOL boundaries extended to the HOKE COUNTY line up kind of NORTHEAST OF MAXTON , and NORTHEAST OF MAXTON was where it was expected that WE might have A PROBLEM with integration picking up THE DIFFERENT STUDENTS .
THE DIFFERENT STUDENTS had AN EXTRA LARGE BUS AT PROSPECT , AN EXTRA LARGE BUS AT PROSPECT that THE DIFFERENT STUDENTS gave this route to , and AN EXTRA LARGE BUS AT PROSPECT would pick up the students that were expected to be integrated .
AN EXTRA LARGE BUS AT PROSPECT went up in that direction , and AN EXTRA LARGE BUS AT PROSPECT dropped off the primary students at Oxendine School .
But anyway , the principal Mr. MR. DANFORD Dial MR. DANFORD came to MR. JAMES MOORE , and MR. DANFORD said MR. JAMES MOORE want to know that MR. JAMES MOORE have a man on AN EXTRA LARGE BUS AT PROSPECT .
MR. DANFORD says , will YOU drive for MR. JAMES MOORE if YOU do n't drive but for TWO or three months which MR. JAMES MOORE agreed to .
MR. JAMES MOORE agreed to drive and MR. JAMES MOORE drove for THREE MONTHS and told MR. DANFORD MR. JAMES MOORE 'd had enough of THREE MONTHS .
We did have incidents that could have turned into violence .
However THREE MONTHS did n't .
MR. JAMES MOORE 'm not giving MR. JAMES MOORE CREDIT FOR HIS ELECTION .
CREDIT FOR HIS ELECTION was handled somewhere CREDIT FOR HIS ELECTION was n't .
But CREDIT FOR HIS ELECTION almost became violent at THE SCHOOL , the people in THE PROSPECT COMMUNITY .
So it was pretty rough THE PRESENT TIME however we came through THE PRESENT TIME without anybody getting hurt , of which MR. JAMES MOORE 'm glad .
Now WHAT ABOUT THE CLUB ACTIVITIES IN THE 1960S AFTER MR. LACY was kept running unopposed .
What did y' all focus on at that point ?
Not going back to , after MR. LACY was eliminated .
A LAW FIXED TO THE EFFECT THAT TO BE A RECORDER 'S COURT JUDGE THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE A LAW DEGREE , AND OF COURSE THAT WAS MADE TO ELIMINATE ANYMORE RECORDER 'S COURT JUDGES was passed to eliminate MR. LACY running for judge -
Do YOUR remember about WHAT TIME THAT WAS ?
No .
MR. JAMES MOORE guess , Mr. -LSB- unclear -RSB- MR. JAMES MOORE think it was FOUR terms .
MR. JAMES MOORE think UNCLE EARLY served TWO and Mr. Lacy TWO .
WE still stayed together as A CLUB , but WE were never as close knit as a group as WE were to begin with .
However , THIS CLUB was founded .
THIS CLUB does n't exist now , and THIS CLUB was determined at THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BUILDING IT-MR .
MACK LOCKLEAR let WE have THE LAND TO PUT IT ON .
MACK LOCKLEAR land adjoined THE SCHOOLS .
MACK LOCKLEAR land adjoined THE SCHOOLS , and MACK LOCKLEAR let WE have the land to put THE LAND TO PUT IT ON on with the provision that if WE ever ceased as A CLUB , that A CLUB would go back to MACK LOCKLEAR family .
THE LAND TO PUT IT ON never has , MR. JAMES MOORE really do n't know just how THE LAND TO PUT IT ON stands at THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BUILDING IT-MR that THE LAND TO PUT IT ON has been used , THE LAND TO PUT IT ON was used for YEARS BY-I DO N'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS-AS A KIND OF NURSERY THING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE and MR. JAMES MOORE believe right now there 's , MR. JAMES MOORE believe THE SHERIFF 'S DEPARTMENT has THE SHERIFF 'S DEPARTMENT as what would YOU call THE YOUNG PEOPLE .
A substation .
As a substation , yeah .
MR. JAMES MOORE do n't know just how what ITS STATUS RIGHT , ITS STATUS RIGHT at THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BUILDING IT-MR .
MR. JAMES MOORE do n't know .
Talk then , YOUR had started to talk about some of the breakdown that happened around when HOKE COUNTY wanted to integrate THE SCHOOLS .
When THE INTEGRATION came , like MR. JAMES MOORE said MR. JAMES MOORE took the job of driving THE BUS FOR MR. DANFORD , and there were some incidents where THE INTEGRATION could have become violent on THE BUS FOR MR. DANFORD .
But however , THE INTEGRATION did n't .
MR. JAMES MOORE 'm not giving MR. JAMES MOORE CREDIT FOR HIS ELECTION .
CREDIT FOR HIS ELECTION just worked out that CREDIT FOR HIS ELECTION did n't become violent .
However , MR. JAMES MOORE think maybe why MR. JAMES MOORE decided MR. JAMES MOORE did n't want to continue driving THE BUS FOR MR. DANFORD was one morning MR. JAMES MOORE drove in and unloaded , and there was a group of parents .
They were all Indian parents at THE SCHOOL .
The parents and MR. DANFORD got into A CONFUSION .
A CONFUSION almost turned violent A CONFUSION looked like , but A CONFUSION did n't .
MR. DANFORD resigned .
MR. DANFORD took THIS , MR. DANFORD used THIS as an excuse to resign , and MR. DANFORD had done such a wonderful job as principal .
But anyway , MR. DANFORD resigned , and MR. JAMES ARTHUR JONES WHO WAS ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL AT THAT TIME , MR. JAMES ARTHUR JONES WHO WAS ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL AT THAT TIME became our principal , and MR. JAMES ARTHUR JONES WHO WAS ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL AT THAT TIME stayed for YEARS BY-I DO N'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS-AS A KIND OF NURSERY THING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE .
MR. JAMES MOORE do n't remember just how many .
But anyway , MR. JAMES MOORE want to say right here that THE PROGRESS THAT HAS COME ABOUT AT PROSPECT is due largely to those TWO men , MR. DANFORD and MR. JAMES ARTHUR JONES WHO WAS ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL AT THAT TIME .
What were THOSE INDIAN PARENTS so upset about ?
Well , MR. JAMES MOORE do n't know .
THE PROGRESS THAT HAS COME ABOUT AT PROSPECT was just , THOSE INDIAN PARENTS did n't want the colored in THE SCHOOL .
MR. JAMES MOORE do n't believe MR. JAMES MOORE brought a single white student to THE PROSPECT .
MR. JAMES MOORE believe THE PROSPECT was , THOSE INDIAN PARENTS might have been some that came here , but THOSE INDIAN PARENTS did n't come on THE BUS FOR MR. DANFORD that MR. JAMES MOORE was .
But MR. JAMES MOORE did n't bring any white students .
THE PROSPECT was Indian and colored , and MR. JAMES MOORE think A PROBLEM was A PROBLEM .
MR. JAMES MOORE 'd have to say that the Indians were just upset about integration .
So THEY wanted to stop THE BLACK STUDENTS from coming to THE SCHOOL .
THEY did n't want THE BLACK STUDENTS to come here .
There 's always been , there was A FEAR FOR A LONG TIME that PROSPECT , BORN AND REARED AT PROSPECT was going to be consolidated .
MR. JAMES MOORE do n't know .
MR. JAMES MOORE have n't heard A FEAR FOR A LONG TIME talked recently , but for A LONG TIME it was talked that MAXTON and THE PROSPECT would be consolidated .
MR. JAMES MOORE 'm proud that MAXTON AND PROSPECT have n't because prior to integration MAXTON was one of the towns that had ITS OWN SCHOOL , ITS OWN SCHOOL city schools like Lumberton , Red Springs and so forth .
MR. JAMES MOORE was sorry to see THE PROSPECT , MAXTON and PEMBROKE consolidated together , the high school .
MR. JAMES MOORE think THE PROSPECT took something from each community , especially THE PROSPECT .
Describe what YOUR think THE PROSPECT , what do YOUR think THE PROSPECT took away ?
Well , what did THE PROSPECT take away ? MR. JAMES MOORE just feel like that anybody performs better at home than they will away from home .
As a result there 's a list of STUDENTS THAT HAVE GONE ON BEYOND THE COLLEGE LEVEL AND BECOME DOCTORS , LAWYERS AND WHAT NOT FROM PROSPECT .
Since WHAT TIME THAT WAS , since consolidation of THE PROSPECT , PEMBROKE and MAXTON came about , we 've had one to go beyond THE COLLEGE LEVEL , and PEMBROKE became a dentist from THE PROSPECT .
Prior to that there was just , STUDENTS THAT HAVE GONE ON BEYOND THE COLLEGE LEVEL AND BECOME DOCTORS , LAWYERS AND WHAT NOT FROM PROSPECT 're listed , but MR. JAMES MOORE do n't have WHAT TIME THAT WAS right before MR. JAMES MOORE right at THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BUILDING IT-MR .
But YOUR think there were MORE INDIANS from THE PROSPECT .
During this period of THE PRESENT TIME MR. JAMES MOORE do .
However , YOUR 've had people outside of THE PROSPECT that have become famous .
SOME OF THEM , DR. BROOKS AND HIS BROTHERS AND OTHERS .
But MR. JAMES MOORE think SOME OF THEM , DR. BROOKS AND HIS BROTHERS AND OTHERS . took something about MR. JAMES MOORE really just ca n't say WHAT ABOUT THE CLUB ACTIVITIES IN THE 1960S AFTER MR. LACY , but MR. JAMES MOORE think WHAT ABOUT THE CLUB ACTIVITIES IN THE 1960S AFTER MR. LACY weakened each school when THEM consolidated .
-LRB- TAPE CUTS OFF -RRB- Prospect .
There may be , but right now MR. JAMES MOORE just , MR. JAMES MOORE ca n't think of just what WE are .
-LRB- TAPE CUTS OFF -RRB- may be that MR. JAMES MOORE think of something later that MR. JAMES MOORE could talk about , but right as of NOW MR. JAMES MOORE just ca n't think of NOW .
Yeah .
Well , WE can -
