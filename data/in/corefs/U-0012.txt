In response to YOUR FIRST direction and THEN YOUR can remind I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE of the others .
Okay .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE became a member of THE FACULTY OF THE UNC LAW SCHOOL in the spring of 1970 .
Sometime in 1973 I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE got A TELEPHONE CALL from a wonderful woman named ME-BUT JANIE MAYNOR LOCKLEAR , THE PERSON WHO CONTACTED ME FROM ROBESON COUNTY , and A TELEPHONE CALL was A TELEPHONE CALL that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE heard about THE LUMBEE INDIANS .
JANIE told I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE A LITTLE about THE LUMBEE INDIANS and about A SITUATION INVOLVING OLD MAIN ON THE CAMPUS AT WHAT IS NOW UNC-PEMBROKE .
JANIE asked to bring A GROUP OF PEOPLE from PEMBROKE to talk to I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE about A SITUATION INVOLVING OLD MAIN ON THE CAMPUS AT WHAT IS NOW UNC-PEMBROKE and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE agreed .
We scheduled A MEETING , and A GROUP OF PEOPLE came to meet with I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
As I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE recall A GROUP OF PEOPLE included JANIE .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE believe A GROUP OF PEOPLE may have included JANIE husband Nick .
A GROUP OF PEOPLE included DEXTER BROOKS .
A GROUP OF PEOPLE included CARNELL LOCKLEAR , and there were SOME OTHER FOLKS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'm not sure I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember off the top of I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE head who else was in that FIRST group .
SOME OTHER FOLKS came and told I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE about THE LUMBEES , about the history of THE LUMBEES , about the problems of THE LUMBEES , about THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY , about the history of THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY and various matters .
We met for quite a while .
SOME OTHER FOLKS told I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE about A SITUATION INVOLVING OLD MAIN ON THE CAMPUS AT WHAT IS NOW UNC-PEMBROKE .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE agreed to help SOME OTHER FOLKS in connection with SOME OTHER FOLKS struggle to preserve and protect OLD MAIN .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE enlisted S-C-H-O-E-N-B-A-U-M .
S-C-H-O-E-N-B-A-U-M 's S-C-H-O-E-N-B-A-U-M , to help I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE because at A TELEPHONE CALL A COLLEAGUE OF MINE , PROFESSOR TOM SCHOENBAUM was very interested in statutory provisions for protection of environmental matters .
A COLLEAGUE OF MINE , PROFESSOR TOM SCHOENBAUM was getting into environmental law , and these also involved protection of historical buildings ET CETERA , FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS .
So A COLLEAGUE OF MINE , PROFESSOR TOM SCHOENBAUM agreed to help I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE with A MATTER OF , and WE did set about trying then to save OLD MAIN .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think WE were very successful .
WE legal effort I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think delayed THE DESTRUCTION OF OLD MAIN and eventually the political remedy came through .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE believe GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER promised to save OLD MAIN , and as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE recall about A TELEPHONE CALL BRUCE BARTON started THE CAROLINA INDIAN VOICE .
In an early edition of THE CAROLINA INDIAN VOICE there 's a big full page ad saying that THE WHITE MAN has made WE MANY PROMISES and kept very few of THEM , but GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER promised to save OLD MAIN and GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER has come through on THEM .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember that very clearly .
So WE were able to save OLD MAIN , and as WE were doing that THE FOLKS I WAS TALKING TO INCLUDING JANIE AND DEXTER AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE had become involved .
CARNELL LOCKLEAR was very involved .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE began to meet MORE PEOPLE in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY and began to know more people , and MORE PEOPLE all began talking to I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE about the fact that OLD MAIN is OLD MAIN and of the interest of THE LUMBEE INDIANS in Robeson County in education .
But that there were REAL ISSUES INVOLVING EDUCATION , REAL ISSUES INVOLVING EDUCATION MORE PEOPLE wanted to discuss .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE talk about THE INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY because during A TELEPHONE CALL I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE learned that not everybody was happy with the name Lumbee .
There was A GROUP OF INDIANS CALLING THEMSELVES TUSCARORAS WHO WERE CONCERNED THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT AFFLICTED THEM WAS THE NAME LUMBEE FOR VARIOUS REASONS .
So THE OTHER TUSCARORAS were kind of an independent group , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE worked with TUSCARORAS , starting to work with THE OTHER TUSCARORAS after I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'd been working with THE LUMBEES .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE believe actually THE TUSCARORA GROUP THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THAT was very involved in THE OLD MAIN STRUGGLE also .
THE OTHER TUSCARORAS had actually been lying down in front of bulldozers to protect OLD MAIN .
So THE OTHER TUSCARORAS was another important effort that had delayed THE DESTRUCTION OF OLD MAIN until OUR legal efforts could go into play , and THE OTHER TUSCARORAS delayed THE DESTRUCTION OF OLD MAIN until the political efforts could be effective .
So when OUR started talking about A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY , OUR talked about VARIOUS PROBLEMS OF OPPRESSION , RACIAL OPPRESSION OF RACIAL TENSIONS , but ONE THAT STUCK OUT AS ONE THAT WE MIGHT ADDRESS NEXT , SHOULD ADDRESS NEXT was ONE THAT STUCK OUT AS ONE THAT WE MIGHT ADDRESS NEXT , SHOULD ADDRESS NEXT .
A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME 's A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME .
A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME 's not exactly right .
A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME was more like partial double voting .
A SITUATION INVOLVING OLD MAIN ON THE CAMPUS AT WHAT IS NOW UNC-PEMBROKE was at THE TIME , ANYTHING that there were SIX boards of THE ROBESON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION .
One was called THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION .
Five were called THE CITY BOARDS OF EDUCATION .
There was a Lumberton Board of THE ROBESON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION .
By THE WAY feel free to interrupt I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE at any time .
MALINDA will .
YOU 're doing great .
But MALINDA 'm sort of making a few notes but keep going .
MALINDA will if MALINDA need to .
Well , YOUR may be familiar with THIS GENERAL SITUATION , but I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'll describe THIS GENERAL SITUATION .
Yeah , please do .
THE LAW AT THE TIME provided that-well , let I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE back up A LITTLE BIT and say that THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION had jurisdiction over THE SCHOOLS , GOVERNANCE FOR THE SCHOOLS within THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION area only .
So THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION was responsible for THE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTY AREA ONLY and had nothing to do with THE GOVERNANCE OF THE SCHOOLS in any of the city areas .
THE CITY BOARDS OF EDUCATION governed THE SCHOOLS , GOVERNANCE FOR THE SCHOOLS in THEIR area and had nothing to do with governing THE SCHOOLS , GOVERNANCE FOR THE SCHOOLS in THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION .
THEIR were all separate and ran THE SCHOOLS , GOVERNANCE FOR THE SCHOOLS in THEIR separate areas , much like right now we have a city and county school board in Orange County here , but THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD has nothing to do with the city schools .
So THE NAME COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD is THE NAME COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD .
THE NAME COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD ran the schools outside of THE CITIES , EACH CITY .
But THE NAME COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD did not run all the schools in THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION .
THE NAME COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD had nothing to do with THE SCHOOLS , GOVERNANCE FOR THE SCHOOLS , in THE CITIES , EACH CITY .
So THE NAME COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD 's THE WAY , so all the SIX boards of education were all entirely separate .
All ran THEIR OWN SCHOOLS .
THE ELECTION PROCESS was THE ELECTION PROCESS .
THE LAW AT THE TIME provided that anybody who lived any place in THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION would vote for THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD , lived in each city could vote for each city school board .
So , the upshot was that everybody in THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION elected THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD .
ONLY PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN RED SPRINGS elected the Red Springs School Board .
ONLY PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN RED SPRINGS elected THE MAXTON SCHOOL BOARD ET CETERA .
As THE MAXTON SCHOOL BOARD ET CETERA happened , most of THE INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY were in THE COUNTY SCHOOLS , THE COUNTY SCHOOLS .
The upshot of THIS MEANT THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR THE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD , THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY AREA , which were largely THE LUMBEE INDIANS , did not control THEIR OWN SCHOOLS .
THIS MEANT THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR THE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD , THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY AREA were controlled instead by PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH .
Whereas PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES , EACH CITY , PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES , EACH CITY controlled THEIR OWN SCHOOL BOARD .
So THE NAME DOUBLE VOTING meant that THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY AREA could vote for THEIR OWN SCHOOL BOARD plus THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE call THE NAME DOUBLE VOTING partial double voting because THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY , LARGELY INDIANS , could only vote for THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD , could n't vote for EACH CITY school boards .
What about THE AFRICAN AMERICANS ? What was THIS GENERAL SITUATION ?
Well , THE AFRICAN AMERICANS were spread among the various school boards , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE recollection is that THE LUMBEE INDIANS were THE LUMBEE INDIANS .
But there were white and black students in THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD as well .
THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD was n't totally Indian .
Do YOU feel THE AFRICAN AMERICANS had any more say so over EACH CITY school boards than say Indians would have , THE LUMBEE INDIANS -
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'll tell YOUR generally I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE thought THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS were both OPPRESSED GROUPS IN ROBESON COUNTY AT THIS TIME , and we 're talking in THE EARLY '70S .
That OPPRESSED GROUPS IN ROBESON COUNTY AT THIS TIME were equally oppressed , that there were A NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT WERE USED TO OPPRESS THEM , a number of ways that OPPRESSED GROUPS IN ROBESON COUNTY AT THIS TIME were kept powerless , that THIS DOUBLE VOTING SO CALLED is THIS DOUBLE VOTING SO CALLED was THIS DOUBLE VOTING SO CALLED .
So A NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT WERE USED TO OPPRESS THEM was of particular interest to THE LUMBEE INDIANS and the elimination of double voting A NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT WERE USED TO OPPRESS THEM did n't help OPPRESSED GROUPS IN ROBESON COUNTY AT THIS TIME as much as A NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT WERE USED TO OPPRESS THEM did Indians .
But I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE know , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE did know about a lot of other devices that oppressed OPPRESSED GROUPS IN ROBESON COUNTY AT THIS TIME and also kept THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS from working together .
Talk about those A LITTLE BIT .
THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS can get back to the double voting structure .
But MALINDA 'm sort of interested in THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAME DOWN HERE , WHAT YOU WERE OBSERVING .
Well , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE would n't say in THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAME DOWN HERE , WHAT YOU WERE OBSERVING , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE spent a lot of A TELEPHONE CALL in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE came down often .
A MATTER OF 's not A MATTER OF , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE mean THINGS were pretty clear from the beginning .
But the more I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was there the more I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE learned , and the more I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE learned about A MATTER OF .
THE ONE MATTER RELATED TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT I THOUGHT was THE ONE MATTER RELATED TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT I THOUGHT both OPPRESSED GROUPS IN ROBESON COUNTY AT THIS TIME and WHITES was that THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT I THOUGHT was deliberately kept at a low level of quality .
At A TELEPHONE CALL and A TELEPHONE CALL think still THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY depended for A TELEPHONE CALL economy on low wage industry .
In order to attract industry to THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY , THE FOLKS I WAS TALKING TO INCLUDING JANIE AND DEXTER AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE promised THE LOW WAGES .
One way to maintain THE LOW WAGES was to have a large group of uneducated , even illiterate , citizens who would be willing to work for THE LOW WAGES .
So the education process was kept at a poor level in order to be able to produce PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH .
Another strategy that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE learned about was that THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION was fairly evenly divided between THE THREE RACES , not precisely certainly , but there were pretty strong proportions of each of THE THREE RACES .
In order to keep the whites and blacks from joining together in political races in order to win a race for , win A POLITICAL SEAT , a political position for a member of one of those TWO races , THE INDIAN PEOPLE would often put up candidates from THE WHITE and/or black races to run against other candidates to divide A PRETTY EFFECTIVE DEVICE .
So if there were a serious black candidate or a serious Indian candidate , THE INDIAN PEOPLE would put up a black or Indian candidate to divide A PRETTY EFFECTIVE DEVICE , divide the Indian or black or minority vote , and enable THE WHITE to win .
A PRETTY EFFECTIVE DEVICE was A PRETTY EFFECTIVE DEVICE and A PRETTY EFFECTIVE DEVICE was very strongly used .
So A COUPLE OF THINGS are A COUPLE OF THINGS .
Do YOU have any sense of because across THE SOUTH IN MANY PLACES OBVIOUSLY it was difficult for OPPRESSED GROUPS IN ROBESON COUNTY AT THIS TIME to vote period .
When YOU spent time down here to WHAT EXTENT WERE INDIANS AND BLACKS PARTICIPATING IN THE VOTING PROCESS ? WAS IT EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH TO YOU OR WHAT DID IT -
THE VOTING PROCESS was THE VOTING PROCESS .
DEXTER AT THE TIME was DEXTER AT THE TIME .
So DEXTER AT THE TIME was very good at working with math and numbers and statistics .
DEXTER AT THE TIME did A LOT OF WORK on A LOT OF WORK .
A lot of HIS WORK was in CONNECTION WITH OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE , but DEXTER AT THE TIME was also doing some work on voting rights and voting rights patterns .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember DEXTER AT THE TIME sitting in I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE office and going over figures that DEXTER AT THE TIME 'd worked on .
But frankly I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember becoming directly involved in VOTING RIGHTS , PARTICULARLY THE GENERAL RIGHT THAT EVERY QUALIFIED CITIZEN IS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE , ONE PERSON , ONE VOTE litigation about I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'm not sure exactly what came of I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
Okay .
But YOU would say that by THE TIME , ANYTHING YOU became familiar with THE OLD MAIN STRUGGLE here that WHAT EXTENT WERE INDIANS AND BLACKS PARTICIPATING IN THE VOTING PROCESS ? WAS IT EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH TO YOU OR WHAT DID IT - were certainly trying to participate and had been doing so running candidates and things like that for A WHILE .
Yeah , AND let I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE say that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE learned that A STRUGGLE THAT INVOLVED MORE THAN JUST THE SCHOOLS was A STRUGGLE THAT INVOLVED MORE THAN JUST THE SCHOOLS .
A STRUGGLE THAT INVOLVED MORE THAN JUST THE SCHOOLS was really A STRUGGLE THAT INVOLVED MORE THAN JUST THE SCHOOLS because there were - Let 's see , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE came down there , there were NO INDIAN LAWYERS .
There was THE TERM LUMBEE , and THE TERM LUMBEE was on the Indian Claims Commission , so THE TERM LUMBEE was not available to provide any legal services .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE seem to recall , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't think there was any Indian doctor .
There was DR. BROOKS , DR. BROOKS .
But by and large most of THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY were TEACHERS , PREDOMINANTLY TEACHERS .
MANY OF THESE worked for THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION .
SOME OF THEM OF COURSE worked for some of THE CITY BOARDS OF EDUCATION , and some of SOME OF THEM OF COURSE worked outside THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION .
But a great number of the most educated , best educated Indians in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY worked as TEACHERS , PREDOMINANTLY TEACHERS for THE ROBESON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION .
As long as THE ROBESON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION was under the control of THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY AREA , THE INDIAN PEOPLE is largely THE INDIAN PEOPLE .
So there was A PRETTY REALISTIC FEAR AT THE TIME , among the Indian population in the county board of EDUCATION ABOUT SPEAKING OUT ON BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIANS , about running for office , about speaking out in THEIR SUPPORT ET CETERA , FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think A PRETTY REALISTIC FEAR AT THE TIME was A PRETTY REALISTIC FEAR AT THE TIME .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE gave THE ISSUE even more gravity .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE thought THE ISSUE was very serious as an issue of EDUCATION ABOUT SPEAKING OUT ON BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIANS , but THE ISSUE also had a major impact on the political situation for THE LUMBEE INDIANS in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY .
So the county board at A TELEPHONE CALL was all white .
THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION was predominantly white .
If there was , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'm trying to , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE ca n't remember if there might have been an Indian on THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION .
But THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION was definitely predominantly controlled by WHITES , yes .
So tell WHITES A LITTLE BIT then about the constitutional issues involved in YOU litigation against THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT I THOUGHT .
Well , by A TELEPHONE CALL the United States Supreme Court had developed SOME NEW CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINES about VOTING RIGHTS , PARTICULARLY THE GENERAL RIGHT THAT EVERY QUALIFIED CITIZEN IS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE , ONE PERSON , ONE VOTE .
A number of decisions about equality and fairness in VOTING RIGHTS , PARTICULARLY THE GENERAL RIGHT THAT EVERY QUALIFIED CITIZEN IS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE , ONE PERSON , ONE VOTE .
Under SOME NEW CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINES it was crystal clear that THE DOUBLE VOTING SYSTEM THAT I 'VE DESCRIBED was unconstitutional .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't think there was much question about THE DOUBLE VOTING SYSTEM THAT I 'VE DESCRIBED , but WE had a lot of difficulty establishing THE DOUBLE VOTING SYSTEM THAT I 'VE DESCRIBED .
The FIRST thing WE did is WE went to THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY to try to get some help .
There was only one member of the THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY delegation who supported WE and WE was JOY JOHNSON .
JOY JOHNSON was a black member of THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY , and OPPRESSED GROUPS IN ROBESON COUNTY AT THIS TIME did n't , as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE say , have a great interest in this double voting issue , but JOY JOHNSON supported WE a thousand percent , which I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE thought was great .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember one of the nicest experiences I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE had in THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE met a senator there named WADE SMITH .
WADE SMITH continues to be a good friend of mine .
WADE SMITH 's FINE , FINE GUY . , excellent lawyer in Raleigh and WADE SMITH was very supportive of WE as well .
WADE SMITH was very concerned about A SITUATION INVOLVING OLD MAIN ON THE CAMPUS AT WHAT IS NOW UNC-PEMBROKE .
Generally speaking on a matter of particular local interest THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY will defer to the local delegation , though .
With JOY JOHNSON being the only local legislator who would support WE , WE were unable to get legislative relief .
So WE turned to the courts .
WE filed A LAWSUIT in THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT for THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA .
OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE came before the Honorable Algernon L. Butler as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE recall .
JUDGE BUTLER turned WE down .
So WE had to appeal , and WE went to the United States Court of Appeals for THE FOURTH CIRCUIT , which sits , holds A VERY EUPHORIC OCCASION .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember THE DAY up there very well .
WE were suing THE ROBESON COUNTY BOARD OF ELECTIONS and THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS .
THE ROBESON COUNTY BOARD OF ELECTIONS was represented by an attorney from THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S office .
Excuse I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS was represented by THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S office .
The local Robeson County Board of Elections was represented by JOE FREEMAN BRITT LATER I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think on senior status .
But WE argued OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE , and a great number of Indians , both THE TUSCARORA and THE TERM LUMBEE , came up to RICHMOND for A VERY EUPHORIC OCCASION and filled the courtroom .
OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE was OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE because THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT was very open and fair-minded .
It was very clear from A VERY EUPHORIC OCCASION that they saw the unconstitutionality of THE DOUBLE VOTING SYSTEM THAT I 'VE DESCRIBED , and A VERY EUPHORIC OCCASION was really A VERY EUPHORIC OCCASION .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think WE were very confident after the argument based on the comments of the judges , and after A VERY EUPHORIC OCCASION WE went outside and kind of celebrated .
BRUCE BARTON took some pictures , wrote a nice story in the Carolina Indian Voice about A VERY EUPHORIC OCCASION .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember , though , feeling kind of sad about one thing , which is the only person who could talk to the TWO groups at THE TIME , ANYTHING , THE LUMBEES and THE OTHER TUSCARORAS , was I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
Well , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE guess at the time BRUCE BARTON was still welcome in both groups , but shortly after that THE OTHER TUSCARORAS stopped talking to BRUCE BARTON .
So BRUCE BARTON front-page story about A VERY EUPHORIC OCCASION had TWO photographs of THE LUMBEE INDIANS , one photograph of LUMBEES WITH ME in THE MIDDLE and one photograph of TUSCARORAS with BRUCE BARTON .
LUMBEES WITH ME insisted on being photographed separately , which I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE thought was unfortunate .
But I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE might tell YOUR a little story I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE guess .
A LITTLE STORY ABOUT WHEN WE FILED THE LAWSUIT was A LITTLE STORY ABOUT WHEN WE FILED THE LAWSUIT .
YOUR asked about THE AIM FOLKS .
So maybe I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE can back up A LITTLE BIT and tell YOUR when WE decided to go forward with A LAWSUIT , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE had been working with the THE TERM LUMBEE group that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE described to YOUR .
But as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was working on A LITTLE BIT , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE began working with SOME OF THE TUSCARORAS as well .
SOME OF THE TUSCARORAS became supportive .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE actually had separate meetings with BOTH GROUPS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE met in Pembroke at a restaurant as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE recall with a huge number of Lumbees , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE presented the draft of THE COMPLAINT to BOTH GROUPS and got BOTH GROUPS support .
While WE were meeting , Russell Banks -LSB- actually , DENNIS BANKS -RSB- AND ANOTHER INDIAN FROM THE AIM MOVEMENT came to A MEETING and spoke .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE kind of waited until DENNIS BANKS -RSB- AND ANOTHER INDIAN FROM THE AIM MOVEMENT finished , and DENNIS BANKS -RSB- AND ANOTHER INDIAN FROM THE AIM MOVEMENT left , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE spoke to A GROUP OF PEOPLE again , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember exactly the words-but I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE essentially said I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't think YOUR need to take to the streets .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think WE have LEGAL REMEDIES available .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'd like YOUR to support A LAWSUIT and see if WE can begin getting LEGAL REMEDIES .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think THE WAY TO PROCEED is THE WAY TO PROCEED .
Most people I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think supported that effort .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE know there were some people who supported THE AIM MOVEMENT .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE know there were some actions , barn burnings , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember , and other things attributed to THE AIM FOLKS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think about this time there was a big sit-in at THE ROBESON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION in WASHINGTON as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE recall or at one of the departments in WASHINGTON .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think it was largely THE TUSCARORA GROUP THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THAT .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE then had A MEETING WITH THE TUSCARORA GROUP .
A TELEPHONE CALL we met out in a rural part of Robeson County in a large one-room building , and there were a good number of people .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE would say there were a good hundred people at A MEETING WITH THE TUSCARORA GROUP .
At THE TIME , ANYTHING THE CHIEF OF THE TUSCARORA TRIBE was THE CHIEF OF THE TUSCARORA TRIBE .
See , KEEVER had been one of the people arrested in the sit-in in WASHINGTON .
At THE TIME , ANYTHING KEEVER did n't know each other very well .
Since THEN we 've become VERY GOOD FRIENDS .
But on that date , in front of this assembled group , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE began talking about the proposed lawsuit , and then I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE read THEN THE COMPLAINT .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE read paragraph one of the complaint , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE said , `` The plaintiffs are A GROUP OF INDIANS CALLING THEMSELVES TUSCARORAS WHO WERE CONCERNED THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT AFFLICTED THEM WAS THE NAME LUMBEE FOR VARIOUS REASONS from - '' And I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE did n't finish the sentence when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE felt I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE grabbed from the behind and wheeled around A KNIFE at I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE throat .
There was KEEVER LOCKLEAR HOLDING THE KNIFE and several of THE OTHER TUSCARORAS were surrounding I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
`` What have KEEVER LOCKLEAR HOLDING THE KNIFE What is this ? '' Well , THINGS calmed down in A LITTLE BIT , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE learned that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE had used the term LUMBEES WITH ME , and LUMBEES WITH ME 's when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE learned that THE OTHER TUSCARORAS thought that A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME was A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME .
Um hmm .
Could YOU talk about THAT FOR JUST A MINUTE ?
Why was that A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME ?
Why was that A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME ?
Let A VERY CLEAR NAME , VERY EXPRESSIVE NAME see .
THIS is taking I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE back A LITTLE BIT .
Generally I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think that THIS thought that THE TERM LUMBEE was a name given to the group by white political leadership .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE believe there was a statute , state or federal , that FIRST used THE TERM LUMBEE and then another statute , state or federal , that used THE NAME LUMBEE FOR VARIOUS REASONS .
THE TERM LUMBEE AND THEN ANOTHER STATUTE , STATE OR FEDERAL thought there were a number of original tribes .
THE TUSCARORA being one .
CROATAN being another .
There were SEVERAL OTHERS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'm trying to remember SEVERAL OTHERS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE know at least one other tribal name , and SEVERAL OTHERS thought that THE INDIANS IN EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA were actually MEMBERS OF THESE SEVERAL TRIBES ; that MEMBERS OF THESE SEVERAL TRIBES had been amalgamated together in consideration by the government as THE TERM LUMBEE ; that as THE TERM LUMBEE SEVERAL OTHERS were SEVERAL OTHERS .
JUST A NAME THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE LUMBER RIVER AND WAS NOT A NAME was JUST A NAME THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE LUMBER RIVER AND WAS NOT A NAME that any of the Indians BOTH GROUPS had used before JUST A NAME THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE LUMBER RIVER AND WAS NOT A NAME was given to BOTH GROUPS by THE WHITE MAN .
BOTH GROUPS thought that , and BOTH GROUPS were quite right that , THE INDIANS IN EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA were not federally recognized .
There was a statute that called BOTH GROUPS THE TERM LUMBEE did n't give BOTH GROUPS all the rights of THE LUMBEE INDIANS , and so BOTH GROUPS thought that JUST A NAME THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE LUMBER RIVER AND WAS NOT A NAME deprived BOTH GROUPS of BOTH GROUPS identity and was THE REASON THEY COULD N'T GET THEIR RIGHTS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think BOTH GROUPS also thought that back in the Roosevelt era some Tuscaroras had been tested , blood tested by the New Deal government to determine whether BOTH GROUPS were really Indians and had been found to be Indians .
BOTH GROUPS thought that the descendants of THE INDIAN PEOPLE had particular claim to federal recognition .
BOTH GROUPS were among THE OTHER TUSCARORAS .
So BOTH GROUPS thought A HISTORICAL DIFFERENCE SORT OF INTERPRETATION DIFFERENCE actually denied BOTH GROUPS , deprived BOTH GROUPS of BOTH GROUPS identity and that the THE TUSCARORA name and the CROATAN name ET CETERA , FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS were more descriptive , more accurate about ET CETERA , FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS tribal history and background and that by , if ET CETERA , FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS used the THE TUSCARORA name rather than A HISTORICAL DIFFERENCE SORT OF INTERPRETATION DIFFERENCE , BOTH GROUPS would be more successful in getting federal recognition and VOTING RIGHTS , PARTICULARLY THE GENERAL RIGHT THAT EVERY QUALIFIED CITIZEN IS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE , ONE PERSON , ONE VOTE that BOTH GROUPS were entitled to .
So A HISTORICAL DIFFERENCE SORT OF INTERPRETATION DIFFERENCE 's A HISTORICAL DIFFERENCE SORT OF INTERPRETATION DIFFERENCE .
Historical , right .
Is there , were there OTHER DIFFERENCES THAT YOU OBSERVED , political opinions or economic realities or - ?
Well , generally speaking , MY SENSE was , that generally speaking THE TUSCARORA were less educated than THE NAME LUMBEE FOR VARIOUS REASONS .
MY SENSE 's not , there were less educated LUMBEES WITH ME also , but the more educated Indians tended to be LUMBEES WITH ME .
THE OTHER TUSCARORAS tended to be largely farmers and skilled workers or unskilled workers ET CETERA , FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think there was also an economic disparity between THE OTHER TUSCARORAS .
THE LUMBEES were talking about PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH , but THE LUMBEES were A LITTLE better off than THE TUSCARORA generally , and politically I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'd say that THE TUSCARORA were more radical , more action-oriented than THE LUMBEES .
So -
Well , THE LUMBEES 's interesting -
But I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'd like to make clear that although I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE started out with THE LUMBEES , LUMBEES WITH ME 're THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY AREA , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE began working with THE TUSCARORA , and as long as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was working with A GROUP OF PEOPLE , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was supportive of both and working with both groups .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE thought BOTH GROUPS were working in THE COMMON INTEREST even though from other directions .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE just thought it was kind of sad that BOTH GROUPS could n't work together , and THE COMMON INTEREST 's THE COMMON INTEREST .
BOTH GROUPS did n't have much and even when BOTH GROUPS did n't have much BOTH GROUPS were fighting over WHAT LITTLE BIT OF POWER BOTH GROUPS 've had .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think SOME OF THOSE POWER STRUGGLES have been hurtful to the Indians in THE SAME WAY SOME OF THOSE POWER STRUGGLES are to OTHER GROUPS .
Well , THE SAME WAY 's interesting that a sense of political radicalism does n't always accompany greater poverty , but in certain situations in the country during A TELEPHONE CALL those TWO things seemed to work together .
MALINDA 'm just A GOOD QUESTION .
Well , A GOOD QUESTION 's A GOOD QUESTION .
When we say radicalism , A GOOD QUESTION 's A GOOD QUESTION .
THE LUMBEES were certainly ready to stand up for THEIR rights .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE mean THE TIME , ANYTHING was right , and all THEIR needed to do was throw off some shackles .
One of those shackles THEIR needed to throw off was white control of THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD .
Once that shackle got thrown off , we were successful in THE DOUBLE VOTING SUIT , THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE INDIANS .
THE DOUBLE VOTING SUIT , THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE INDIANS made A HUGE DIFFERENCE because MANY OF THE NATURAL LEADERS OF THE INDIAN COMMUNITY WHO HAD BEEN HELD DOWN , BURDENED BY THAT SHACKLE , felt free to soar .
So MANY OF THE NATURAL LEADERS OF THE INDIAN COMMUNITY WHO HAD BEEN HELD DOWN , BURDENED BY THAT SHACKLE began to express MANY OF THE NATURAL LEADERS OF THE INDIAN COMMUNITY WHO HAD BEEN HELD DOWN , BURDENED BY THAT SHACKLE politically , become active politically and so THE DOUBLE VOTING SUIT , THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE INDIANS 's THE DOUBLE VOTING SUIT , THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE INDIANS if YOUR will .
MANY OF THE NATURAL LEADERS OF THE INDIAN COMMUNITY WHO HAD BEEN HELD DOWN , BURDENED BY THAT SHACKLE really threw off AN OPPRESSIVE SYSTEM .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think AN OPPRESSIVE SYSTEM 's probably to some extent had more to do with level of education and economic level although A COUPLE OF THINGS are associated .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think the more educated people may have been able to understand THE LEGAL PROCESS and perhaps THE POLITICAL PROCESS and the importance of A COUPLE OF THINGS .
Because MALINDA think when PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH hear this interview , PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH 're going to be reminded of THE SPLIT within the African American community between say DR. KING 'S .
THE SPLIT 's THE SPLIT .
Would YOU have anything to add to THE SPLIT or a way to kind of make that more specific or more local for other people doing research ?
Well , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think MY SENSE is that one characteristic of THE HUMAN CONDITION I THINK THAT WHEN YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF POWER YOU START DIVIDING IT is that THAT OR A WAY try very hard to divide THAT OR A WAY and to find OTHER DIFFERENCES THAT YOU OBSERVED , and THAT OR A WAY try to elevate THAT OR A WAY by I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE and THE LUMBEE INDIANS is immune from I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
Every group does MY SENSE and that MY SENSE 's MY SENSE .
In MY SENSE I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think MY SENSE is MY SENSE , YOUR draw a fair parallel even though the exact definition of the difference between OTHER GROUPS may be different .
But of course , there is A NATURAL DIFFERENCE .
A NATURAL DIFFERENCE is A NATURAL DIFFERENCE as well .
It might be more accurate actually to say that A NATURAL DIFFERENCE was more like some of the difference at the time between the NAACP 's approach and DR. KING 'S approach , but of course A NATURAL DIFFERENCE depends on YOU perspective .
Can OTHER GROUPS just go back one step ? MALINDA had had a question about when YOU took OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE to court .
ON WHAT GROUNDS JUDGE BUTLER OVERTURNED , NOT OVERTURNED -
REFUSED TO -
Refused to lift REFUSED TO - .
To tell YOUR THE TRUTH , MALINDA , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember exactly what ON WHAT GROUNDS JUDGE BUTLER OVERTURNED , NOT OVERTURNED - rationale was or if ON WHAT GROUNDS JUDGE BUTLER OVERTURNED , NOT OVERTURNED - actually gave much of a rationale .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE really I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember there was much to an opinion that ON WHAT GROUNDS JUDGE BUTLER OVERTURNED , NOT OVERTURNED - wrote to tell YOUR THE TRUTH , MALINDA .
What about JOE FREEMAN BRITT LATER argument on the behalf of ROBESON COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD , ROBESON COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD .
Yeah , good question .
What was JOE FREEMAN BRITT LATER argument ? To tell YOUR THE TRUTH , MALINDA , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'd probably have to go back and look to see .
HIS ARGUMENT ? TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH , MALINDA 's hard after all these years to think of any possible argument THEY could have made .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't really remember exactly what THEY were trying to say .
Okay .
Well , THEY can sort of-I 'm sure THEY can do some research .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember A VERY DECENT FELLOW was A VERY DECENT FELLOW , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember A VERY DECENT FELLOW made , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember thinking A VERY DECENT FELLOW made a reasonable argument , but I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think there was n't much to THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S OFFICE .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 's why I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE say in THE ORAL ARGUMENT IN RICHMOND it was pretty clear that we were going to win .
There just was n't much to THEY argument .
Do YOU feel like THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'S growing involvement in school desegregation had any impact on OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE , the Justice Department and THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 'S OFFICE of education in WASHINGTON ?
Well , THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'S GROWING INVOLVEMENT IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION 's A GOOD QUESTION .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE ca n't say that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE noticed that at THE TIME , ANYTHING about I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
Yeah , MALINDA think , did YOU know HELEN SHEIRBECK WELL AT THAT TIME ?
Who ?
HELEN SHEIRBECK WELL AT THAT TIME
Now that name does sound familiar .
Who was HELEN SHEIRBECK WELL AT THAT TIME ?
MALINDA guess HELEN SHEIRBECK WELL AT THAT TIME was working in THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION in DC then , and MALINDA just , THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION 's THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION .
HELEN SHEIRBECK WELL AT THAT TIME had some involvement in local matters here , but MALINDA do n't really know what they were .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE recognize JUST A NAME THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE LUMBER RIVER AND WAS NOT A NAME , but I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember any more than JUST A NAME THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE LUMBER RIVER AND WAS NOT A NAME .
Okay .
Okay .
Well , YOU talked A LITTLE BIT about the impact of breaking double voting for LUMBEES WITH ME .
Tell US , once the court case was won , what were the kind of sequence of events that took place to put THE WHOLE THING into effect , enforce THE WHOLE THING ?
All right .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think as soon as US won OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE or maybe shortly before , THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD gave THE SUPERINTENDENT A NEW CONTRACT FOR FOUR YEARS , WHICH WAS THE MAXIMUM THEY COULD GIVE HIM .
So LUMBEES WITH ME were trying to protect LUMBEES WITH ME power through THE SUPERINTENDENT .
US , once US won , US tried to get A NEW CONTRACT FOR FOUR YEARS , WHICH WAS THE MAXIMUM THEY COULD GIVE HIM set aside .
US went for emergency relief before one of the judges in THE FOURTH CIRCUIT from NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS JUDGE J. BRAXTON CRAVEN , A JUDGE FOR WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS HAD IMMENSE RESPECT .
But J. BRAXTON CRAVEN turned US down .
J. BRAXTON CRAVEN said J. BRAXTON CRAVEN thought US were not going to suffer irreparable harm , that US could wait out the four years with THE SUPERINTENDENT and then have THE NEW BOARD ELECT A SUPERINTENDENT .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was kind of disappointed by I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
But then THE NEW BOARD ELECT A SUPERINTENDENT was elected .
THE NEW BOARD ELECT A SUPERINTENDENT was primarily THE NEW BOARD ELECT A SUPERINTENDENT .
THE NEW BOARD ELECT A SUPERINTENDENT did elect , appoint PURNELL SWETT to be the FIRST superintendent of THE NEW COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION .
So THE NEW BOARD ELECT A SUPERINTENDENT was THE NEW BOARD ELECT A SUPERINTENDENT .
Were PURNELL SWETT
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE did n't have anything to do , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE left that with the local people .
No , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE did n't have anything to do with I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do recall , OF RECRUITING VOTES FOR THAT NEW BOARD OR also did , there was a fellow named OXENDINE WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE must say , generally speaking , that GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER was elected governor .
GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER had come through THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY and promised to save OLD MAIN and had gotten the ear of THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY , LARGELY INDIANS and A NUMBER OF INDIANS changed THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY , LARGELY INDIANS registration from DEMOCRATIC TO REPUBLICAN because THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTY , LARGELY INDIANS liked GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER and MANY PROMISES .
MALINDA think , can YOU hang on just one second .
MALINDA think YOU 're sort of fading out again .
Are YOU there ?
Yeah .
Can YOUR hear I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE again ? Maybe the batteries are going down .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'll try another phone .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 've had ONE THAT STUCK OUT AS ONE THAT WE MIGHT ADDRESS NEXT , SHOULD ADDRESS NEXT before too . -LSB- sounds of movement -RSB- Hello .
Is that better ?
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 's great .
So back up for MALINDA to GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER had saved Old OLD MAIN .
Yeah .
Okay .
GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER had promised to save OLD MAIN , and GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER eventually did when GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER became governor .
OLD MAIN thrilled PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH , and GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER also appointed A NUMBER OF INDIANS to positions in GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER government .
One of these was , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'm trying to remember GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER name .
GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER was one of a group of brothers who had GOOD POSITIONS IN EDUCATION .
GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER name was OXENDINE WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION , but I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember the FIRST name now .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE remember being at HIS FUNERAL .
EARL HUGHES .
Huh ?
Was HIS FUNERAL EARL HUGHES ?
EARL HUGHES
FINE , FINE GUY .
When WE won THE DOUBLE VOTING SUIT , THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE INDIANS and THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION still tried to reappoint , give THE SUPERINTENDENT A FOUR-YEAR CONTRACT , EARL HUGHES had been appointed to THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION , WHICH HAD TO APPROVE THE CONTRACT .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE did go with THE SUPERINTENDENT to A MEETING OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION where THE SUPERINTENDENT tried to get them to turn A MEETING OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION down .
THE SUPERINTENDENT was unsuccessful .
A MEETING OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION was after that that WE went to THE FOURTH CIRCUIT .
FIRST to JUDGE J. BRAXTON CRAVEN I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think to a full panel , and WE were unsuccessful .
So there was a little delay in - WE then did have an election , and THE LUMBEE INDIANS did win , and then JUDGE J. BRAXTON CRAVEN were able after the four-year contract of that superintendent to appoint PURNELL SWETT and begin getting control over THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD .
YOU were saying that a lot of Indians had switched from DEMOCRAT , WE registration from DEMOCRAT to REPUBLICAN .
Did that influence THE LEGAL PROCESS ?
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think that THE LEGAL PROCESS did enable A NUMBER OF INDIANS to get GOOD POSITIONS IN EDUCATION , appointed to good positions in THE HOLSHOUSER ADMINISTRATION , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do think that THE HOLSHOUSER ADMINISTRATION generally was concerned about THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIANS in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do remember-and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE tell YOUR THIS is very poignant for ME-BUT JANIE MAYNOR LOCKLEAR , THE PERSON WHO CONTACTED ME FROM ROBESON COUNTY and who had been a leader in all of these struggles developed an illness .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE did A LITTLE LEGAL WORK for HER in trying to get some help from HER health insurer in CONNECTION WITH OUR DOUBLE VOTING CASE so I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was in touch with HER and then unfortunately HER passed away .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE went to HER funeral and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was very pleased .
We were sitting in there when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE saw GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER walk in and sit down at HER funeral .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE thought I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was very nice .
HIS FUNERAL brought back a nice memory of what an excellent governor GOVERNOR JIM HOLSHOUSER had been on BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIANS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE must say actually Governor JIM MARTIN also was pretty good for THE LUMBEE INDIANS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think to SOME EXTENT THIS MIGHT BE BECAUSE , are YOUR there ?
Yeah .
The DEMOCRATIC TO REPUBLICAN party largely controlled and still controls THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY .
So politically I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think it was A GOOD MOVE FOR THEM TO HELP THE INDIANS , but I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think BOTH GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER AND GOVERNOR MARTIN WERE SINCERE ABOUT THAT , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was impressed with what BOTH GOVERNOR HOLSHOUSER AND GOVERNOR MARTIN WERE SINCERE ABOUT THAT did for THE LUMBEE INDIANS in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY .
A GOOD MOVE FOR THEM TO HELP THE INDIANS 's interesting MALINDA think to some historians the fact that Indians obviously a large number of them , but still fairly isolated regionally and economically from sort of the mainstream , would carry that kind of political weight on a state level .
Do YOU have any thoughts about A GOOD MOVE FOR THEM TO HELP THE INDIANS ?
Well , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think the explanation is that actually there was A GOOD FELLOW .
A GOOD FELLOW did n't win .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember A GOOD FELLOW name now .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'm trying to think of A GOOD FELLOW name .
A GOOD FELLOW was A GOOD FELLOW .
A GOOD FELLOW was very interested in and supportive of THE LUMBEE INDIANS .
A GOOD FELLOW became VERY GOOD FRIENDS at A TELEPHONE CALL because A GOOD FELLOW talked to I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE about LEGAL ISSUES involving THE LUMBEE INDIANS , and A GOOD FELLOW went to THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY and campaigned among THE LUMBEE INDIANS .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think MY SENSE is that the Republican Party saw an opportunity for AN INROAD into the DEMOCRATIC TO REPUBLICAN control of THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think VERY GOOD FRIENDS did achieve some success in that respect although THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION is still largely DEMOCRATIC TO REPUBLICAN , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think the number of Republicans among the Indians to MY SENSE has diminished .
So Indians at A TELEPHONE CALL tended to vote together , YOU would say .
Was THE RACIAL SITUATION PART OF THE REASON VERY GOOD FRIENDS felt VERY GOOD FRIENDS had AN INROAD or -
Right .
So THE RACIAL SITUATION PART OF THE REASON was THE RACIAL SITUATION PART OF THE REASON .
THE RACIAL SITUATION , there were THE RACIAL SITUATION , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think THE LUMBEE INDIANS were very appreciative and supportive of PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH .
So tended to bring in votes for that candidate that would do A COUPLE OF THINGS .
Right .
Okay .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't want to be totally cynical .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do believe that BOTH HOLSHOUSER AND MARTIN understood LEGAL ISSUES , understood the plight of THE LUMBEE INDIANS and sincerely wanted to help BOTH HOLSHOUSER AND MARTIN .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do remember hearing a report of a conversation that JIM MARTIN had with JOE FREEMAN BRITT LATER .
There was A NEW JUDGESHIP CREATED THAT WAS DESIGNED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY .
DEXTER BROOKS applied for A NEW JUDGESHIP CREATED THAT WAS DESIGNED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY , and JOE FREEMAN BRITT LATER decided to apply for A NEW JUDGESHIP CREATED THAT WAS DESIGNED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE heard , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't know if A NEW JUDGESHIP CREATED THAT WAS DESIGNED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY 's true or not , but I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE heard that JOE FREEMAN BRITT LATER had a conversation with JIM MARTIN when JIM MARTIN explained to JIM MARTIN that A POLITICAL SEAT was designed for A MINORITY .
JOE FREEMAN BRITT LATER said , well , Governor in Robeson County I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE am A MINORITY .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'm white .
JIM MARTIN said I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 's not what THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TO BE FOR A MINORITY intended by minority .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was kind of impressed with stories like that that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE heard about JIM MARTIN and JIM MARTIN real understanding and support for THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIANS .
Let MALINDA see .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE sort of reminded I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
Well , MALINDA guess MALINDA was thinking about , this is again going back A LITTLE BIT , to the expansion of THE LUMBERTON SCHOOL BOARD and correct MALINDA if MALINDA 'm wrong but MALINDA think MALINDA remember reading there were seats added to the board that were designated for minorities .
Is that right ? I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
Okay .
Okay .
Well , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE -RSB-
Okay .
Once we won A LAWSUIT .
Yeah , then I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was not quite so involved on a regular basis .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE did n't necessarily keep up with everything that was going on there .
Okay .
Okay .
Well , all right .
Then MALINDA 'll have to make sure to ask a series of questions then to SOME OTHER FOLKS ABOUT THE SORT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CASE , OF THE LAWSUIT .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE need YOUR to speak up now .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE ca n't hear YOUR very well .
Oh , is that better ?
Much better yeah .
Well , MALINDA guess MALINDA 'd like to get , again go back a little bit in A TELEPHONE CALL and talk A LITTLE BIT about YOU own background and getting into law and sort of how YOUR OWN BACKGROUND relates to the passion YOU obviously developed for the situation here speaking from YOU own experience .
For EXAMPLE WHEN YOU WERE IN LAW SCHOOL OR BECAME A LAW PROFESSOR , WHAT LITTLE BIT OF POWER drew YOU to LEGAL ISSUES here ?
Well , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think EXAMPLE WHEN YOU WERE IN LAW SCHOOL OR BECAME A LAW PROFESSOR 's fair to say that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE had I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE own social and political consciousness aroused by THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was in high school when THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT was getting strong , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE had I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE eyes opened to discrimination then .
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT was all around I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE , but I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE had n't noticed THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE became very concerned about the unfair treatment of OTHER PEOPLE , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think that PROBABLY MY SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL I BECAME VERY MUCH interested in OTHER PEOPLE and started learning about PROBABLY MY SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL I BECAME VERY MUCH .
YOU went to high school where ?
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE went to high school in Michigan .
Go ahead .
MALINDA 'm sorry .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was in A LARGE PART OF MY MOTIVATION , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think A LARGE PART OF MY MOTIVATION was A LARGE PART OF MY MOTIVATION .
When I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was in law school I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE worked ONE SUMMER FOR , or part of one ONE SUMMER FOR for ONE SUMMER FOR was called LSCRRC , LSCRRC , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't remember JUST A NAME THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE LUMBER RIVER AND WAS NOT A NAME .
But it was an internship program for LAW STUDENTS who would go down THE SOUTH IN MANY PLACES OBVIOUSLY and help work with lawyers from the North who were coming down for limited periods of A TELEPHONE CALL .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE worked for Marian Wright , who is now Marian Wright Edelman , in Jackson , Mississippi in THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and also I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE spent , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE took a week out off of THE UNC LAW SCHOOL and went down to Selma , Alabama during all the voting rights demonstrations there .
So a large part of I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE what was shaping I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE then I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE guess was THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
Then YOU decided to go into THE UNC LAW SCHOOL , MALINDA mean , MALINDA 'm sorry , a professor of law specifically to sort of teach others or -
Well , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE do n't know that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE specifically had that in mind but certainly when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE joined THE FACULTY OF THE UNC LAW SCHOOL , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was in CIVIL RIGHTS and continued A LITTLE LEGAL WORK in CIVIL RIGHTS generally .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think A LITTLE LEGAL WORK with THE LUMBEE INDIANS when JANIE and A GROUP OF PEOPLE came down to talk to I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE , it was right away very clear that that fit right into what I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was interested in .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was glad to work on I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
Did YOU have any particular response when YOU learned about Indian history here in NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS JUDGE J. BRAXTON CRAVEN , A JUDGE FOR WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS HAD IMMENSE RESPECT Was NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS JUDGE J. BRAXTON CRAVEN , A JUDGE FOR WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS HAD IMMENSE RESPECT surprising or typical in some way ? How would YOU describe YOU reaction to YOUR REACTION ?
Well , as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE said I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE had never heard of THE LUMBEES , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE probably did n't know anything about Indians in NORTH CAROLINA until JANIE and A GROUP OF PEOPLE came to talk to I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
After I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE talked to a lot of PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH and did quite a bit of reading about THE LUMBEE INDIANS in NORTH CAROLINA .
Actually at one point I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think had , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE believe it was a THE TUSCARORA group brought to I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE a massive quantity of documents that PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH were putting together trying to get federal recognition , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE reviewed all that .
So in the process of doing that , attending a number of Indian cultural events there , getting to know a lot of THE INDIAN PEOPLE , THE INDIAN PEOPLE 's when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE began learning about the Indian history and plight in EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE really ca n't say that before THE DAY that A GROUP OF PEOPLE came to see I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was particularly well informed about THE DAY although of course I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was generally informed about THE DAY .
Well , talk , speaking of getting to know some people , talk a little bit about DEXTER BROOKS and YOU working relationship with DEXTER BROOKS .
Sure .
Well , yeah , DEXTER was a gem and was a very special , a very special person .
DEXTER was very dedicated to THE INDIAN PEOPLE , and DEXTER was very helpful to I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
WE worked together very closely during the time of THE DOUBLE VOTING SUIT , THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE INDIANS , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE mentioned DEXTER talked to DEXTER that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was not ultimately involved in .
But I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 'm proud to say A LITTLE LEGAL WORK was A LITTLE LEGAL WORK that WE did together that encouraged DEXTER to come to THE UNC LAW SCHOOL and very pleased that DEXTER was very successful .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was also one of his professors in THE UNC LAW SCHOOL and WE were VERY GOOD FRIENDS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was very pleased to see DEXTER go back into THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY and start A PRACTICE and begin delivering LEGAL SERVICES to Indians and build up A PRACTICE .
Also DEXTER was very genuinely devoted to increasing the numbers of Indian lawyers in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY , and DEXTER and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE worked together to try to bring Indians from THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY to one of the law schools .
WE tried to bring at least one Indian to the UNC law school every year and tried to also encourage Indians to go to North Carolina Central and Duke as well as other law schools .
DEXTER was really DEXTER , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE often met with LAW STUDENTS and talked with LAW STUDENTS and also talked with TEACHERS , PREDOMINANTLY TEACHERS and tried to develop a program for bringing SOME OTHER FOLKS ABOUT THE SORT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CASE , OF THE LAWSUIT , and DEXTER was very successful .
When PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH graduated , DEXTER had room for some of PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES COULD VOTE FOR EACH in DEXTER law firm and helped OTHERS set up OTHERS own practices , and then DEXTER also helped start A LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM IN PEMBROKE .
DEXTER recruited JULIAN PIERCE to be JULIAN PIERCE , and DEXTER served as president of A LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM IN PEMBROKE .
A LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM IN PEMBROKE was A LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM IN PEMBROKE , it was very timely because LEGAL SERVICES was , THIS was A LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM IN PEMBROKE .
THIS were getting MORE SUPPORT from THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'S , and NORTH CAROLINA had developed a program called Legal Services of NORTH CAROLINA , and there was funding available for LEGAL SERVICES .
MORE SUPPORT was very organized and supported , and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was also involved in legal services in THE COUNTY AREA ONLY here , and so DEXTER shared THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIANS in developing legal service programs .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE met JULIAN PIERCE WITH DEXTER AND THEN ON MANY OCCASIONS and thought the world of JULIAN PIERCE WITH DEXTER AND THEN ON MANY OCCASIONS .
Talk about JULIAN SOME also .
When YOU met JULIAN SOME , the same sort of things that YOU mentioned about DEXTER in TERMS OF , THAT HAD TO DO WITH SCHOOLS OR THAT HAD TO DO WITH - -
Well , JULIAN SOME was JULIAN SOME .
This whole scheme , of course when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE went down as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE said , when I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE FIRST was invited by JANIE and DEXTER and CARNELL LOCKLEAR and A GROUP OF PEOPLE down to THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY , there were NO INDIAN LAWYERS there .
There was a tremendous need for INDIAN LAWYERS OF COURSE , and the absence of INDIAN LAWYERS OF COURSE left INDIAN LAWYERS OF COURSE vulnerable , left THE LUMBEE INDIANS there very vulnerable to A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS , not just the systemic problems such as double voting but A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS .
There was a great need for INDIAN LAWYERS OF COURSE .
So actually one of the reasons that I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE began having less to do in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY after we won THE DOUBLE VOTING SUIT , THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE INDIANS , at least for A WHILE , was because there were MORE INDIAN LAWYERS there .
DEXTER was down there and OTHERS were down there , and so THE NEED FOR BRINGING SOMEBODY FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTY was diminished .
THE NEED FOR BRINGING SOMEBODY FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTY was n't gone , but THE NEED FOR BRINGING SOMEBODY FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTY was diminished .
There were actually times when even DEXTER would call I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE and say there was A TREMENDOUS DEVELOPMENT .
So A TREMENDOUS DEVELOPMENT was A TREMENDOUS DEVELOPMENT .
A lot of THESE , a lot of MORE INDIAN LAWYERS were working for poor people and were not able to make MORE INDIAN LAWYERS might make in other places .
There was A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM TO FILL A GAP EVEN BELOW THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF POVERTY AMONG THE INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY AS WELL AS OTHERS .
Legal services program was not just for Indians .
A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM TO FILL A GAP EVEN BELOW THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF POVERTY AMONG THE INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY AS WELL AS OTHERS was for poor folk from all races .
So A LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM IN PEMBROKE was started and was terrific for all the poor people in THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION .
JULIAN SOME was just a perfect choice .
JULIAN SOME was brought down as I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE recall from Washington , DC , terrific guy .
JULIAN SOME fit in very well with THE LEGAL SERVICES folks generally .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE ran into JULIAN SOME often because I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was involved in LEGAL SERVICES generally , LEGAL SERVICES circles , I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was involved in OUR own legal services program here , and also I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE started a legal services program for prisoners .
So I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was involved in running TWO legal services programs , and so I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE was running in legal services circles and often saw JULIAN PIERCE there , and JULIAN PIERCE was JULIAN PIERCE in the legal services community .
JULIAN PIERCE was very highly regarded , and JULIAN PIERCE was JULIAN PIERCE and VERY BRIGHT , VERY NICE , VERY BRIGHT GUY was really VERY BRIGHT , VERY NICE , VERY BRIGHT GUY .
JULIAN PIERCE did consult with I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE on a couple of cases that JULIAN PIERCE brought , and JULIAN PIERCE was doing not just what OUR might think of as standard legal service case , individual representation .
JULIAN PIERCE was bringing test cases to improve the condition of people in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY and was doing a great job .
JULIAN PIERCE was involved in THE FIRST CASE TRYING TO CHALLENGE THE DISPARITIES IN FINANCING IN THE SCHOOLS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE worked with JULIAN PIERCE on I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE .
But there JULIAN PIERCE called on I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE as a consultant and I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE helped JULIAN PIERCE to SOME EXTENT THIS MIGHT BE BECAUSE JULIAN PIERCE asked .
JULIAN SOME there in the county as well as DEXTER working on THE FIRST CASE TRYING TO CHALLENGE THE DISPARITIES IN FINANCING IN THE SCHOOLS , THEY MEANING DEXTER AND JULIAN AS WELL AS INDIAN LAWYERS THEY BROUGHT DOWN THERE , BUT PARTICULARLY I WOULD SAY DEXTER AND JULIAN did n't need an outside lawyer to the same extent that THEY MEANING DEXTER AND JULIAN AS WELL AS INDIAN LAWYERS THEY BROUGHT DOWN THERE , BUT PARTICULARLY I WOULD SAY DEXTER AND JULIAN had before .
So THEY MEANING DEXTER AND JULIAN AS WELL AS INDIAN LAWYERS THEY BROUGHT DOWN THERE , BUT PARTICULARLY I WOULD SAY DEXTER AND JULIAN really filled A MAJOR GAP , and THEY MEANING DEXTER AND JULIAN AS WELL AS INDIAN LAWYERS THEY BROUGHT DOWN THERE , BUT PARTICULARLY I WOULD SAY DEXTER AND JULIAN really , THEY MEANING DEXTER AND JULIAN AS WELL AS INDIAN LAWYERS THEY BROUGHT DOWN THERE , BUT PARTICULARLY I WOULD SAY DEXTER AND JULIAN really were responsible for improving THE POLITICAL PROCESS and the conditions for minorities in THE EDUCATED INDIANS IN ROBESON COUNTY .
Yeah , A MAJOR GAP sounds like within BASICALLY THE SORT OF from MALINDA guess '73 when YOU FIRST came down to , was legal services started about ' 83 -
Sounds about right .
' 82 , '83 the opportunities for Indians headed BASICALLY THE SORT OF THE LEGAL PROCESS had exploded perhaps largely as a result of the double voting success .
Yeah .
Well , is there anything YOU feel like MALINDA 've left out to ask or -
About THAT PERIOD , ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE ?
About THAT PERIOD , ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE YOU feel is important .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE 's all I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE can think of now about THAT PERIOD , ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE .
There was A WHOLE SEPARATE STORY I THINK , but A WHOLE SEPARATE STORY I THINK 's A WHOLE SEPARATE STORY I THINK .
In TERMS OF , THAT HAD TO DO WITH SCHOOLS OR THAT HAD TO DO WITH -
Well , in THE SCHOOLS , GOVERNANCE FOR THE SCHOOLS I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think -
MERGER .
MERGER . had to do with THE SCHOOLS , GOVERNANCE FOR THE SCHOOLS .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think , there was AN IMPORTANT PART OF HOW THIS STORY KIND OF ENDS , the JULIAN PIERCE murder and situations surrounding that that led to THE SCHOOL MERGER .
So AN IMPORTANT PART OF HOW THIS STORY KIND OF ENDS did have something to do with THE SCHOOLS , GOVERNANCE FOR THE SCHOOLS .
Well , MALINDA think AN IMPORTANT PART OF HOW THIS STORY KIND OF ENDS would certainly be AN IMPORTANT PART OF HOW THIS STORY KIND OF ENDS .
MALINDA guess if there is AN APPROPRIATE ENDING POINT .
MALINDA might if AN APPROPRIATE ENDING POINT 's all right with YOU , WE might come back to WE at some point later in PROBABLY MY SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL I BECAME VERY MUCH .
I - -LSB- BLANK SPACE think A WHOLE SEPARATE STORY I THINK is A WHOLE SEPARATE STORY I THINK .
Yeah .
When MALINDA kind of gather some more information about this earlier period .
MALINDA think MALINDA would like to know JULIAN 'S MURDER , JULIAN SOME murder and THE SCHOOL MERGER and BASICALLY THE SORT OF , there 's a second wave it seems like of Indian control politically that was being struggled for in THE COUNTY , EACH BOARD OF EDUCATION .
So yeah , MALINDA 'll be coming back to that in the springtime SOME TIME .
So good .
Well , MALINDA appreciate YOU time as always .
Well , thank YOUR MALINDA .
SOME TIME 's nice to talk -
AND AND .
To YOUR .
