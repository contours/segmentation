Okay , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON could just start out telling us where YOU were born and a little bit about YOU family , and YOU early life , and school .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was born in MAXTON CITY , North Carolina in SCOTLAND COUNTY , which as everyone knows MAXTON CITY covers two counties .
MAXTON CITY straddles MAXTON CITY , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was born in Scotland County in 1930 .
MAXTON CITY was during the Depression when everybody was equal , really , because there was MAXTON CITY and big A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 's .
Everybody was struggling just to survive .

MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't have any brothers or sisters .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON have a couple of half-sisters from MY FATHER , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON .
So were YOU raised with both YOU father and YOU mother ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was raised by MY GRANDPARENTS .
By YOU grandparents .
Okay .
Tell US A LITTLE BIT about what going to school was like for YOU when YOU were A CHILD .
Well , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did n't realize until in LATER YEARS HOW BAD OFF WE WERE FOR AT THAT TIME LATER YEARS HOW BAD OFF WE WERE FOR AT THAT TIME was great .
-LSB- Laughter . -RSB-
Because , as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON say , everybody took CARE OF EVERYBODY .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'll put CARE OF EVERYBODY THAT WAY .
In the communities there was more of a togetherness than there is nowadays .
All the grown ups that were old enough to be YOUR PARENTS were allowed to chastise A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW for WHATEVER .
Also , WE all lived in houses that was inadequate , YOUR PARENTS say now , but at A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS YOUR PARENTS were .
WE called YOUR PARENTS air conditioned in the wintertime because A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW could feed THE CHICKENS through the cracks in the floor in THE KITCHEN .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 'd wake up in THE MORNING and take the dipper and break the ice in the water bucket .
THE MORNING 's just how cold THE MORNING would be in THE KITCHEN , and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW had to make a fire in order to heat up .
In THE WINTER there 'd be one big heater where A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW made a fire in there , and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW banked THE WINTER at NIGHT so THE WINTER would n't just completely go out .
In THE MORNING A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW would stoke THE MORNING up , and add more to THE MORNING , and THE MORNING 's where everybody came in to wash up and get dressed .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW did n't walk around in house coat , house shoes and all of this kind of thing because THE HOUSE was n't that comfortable .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW hurried up and got A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW clothes on .
Everyone had THEIR own garden .
THEIR had THEIR own chickens .
QUITE A FEW had a cow , and everybody had THE HOGS .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW did n't buy A LOT OF THINGS from THE STORE , so THE STORE 's why MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON say WE were poor , but WE did n't realize A LOT OF THINGS .
As A MATTER OF FACT , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did n't even know that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was black and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was poor until A MATTER OF FACT was told to MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON in high school .
Wow .
-LSB- Laughter . -RSB-
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did n't , because THOSE THINGS we did n't think about .
Everybody around YOU was black ?
There was Indian and white .
AND everybody .
But nobody ever talked about what color A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW were , and AND all visited each other 's homes .
AND played with EACH OTHER 'S children , and nobody said anything about the race thing .
EACH OTHER 'S just was n't talked about , and nobody made A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW feel inferior in MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY .
But as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON say , once MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON got to high school is when MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON found out that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was poor and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was black .
So what elementary school did YOU go to ?
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON went to MAXTON CITY , MAXTON CITY was called ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL .
And MAXTON CITY was MAXTON CITY ?
Okay .
So then where did YOU go to high school ? MAXTON CITY ?
Same school .
Okay .
So , right .
Well it says here - .
At A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS THEY called A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS primer grade .
Now THEY 've got kindergarten , but it was primer grades through ELEVEN , ELEVEN .
Right , okay .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW did n't go from one school to the next school like THEY do now .
Right .
In THE SAME PLACE THAT R. B. DEAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS NOW , R. B. DEAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL was R. B. DEAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .
Did that ever occur to YOU that YOU did n't go to THE WHITE SCHOOL that YOU played with or that YOU family visited with ? Did that occur to YOU ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE just seemed THE WAY THINGS were , that A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW played together , and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW helped EACH OTHER as far as what A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW needed in the home , or if someone got sick A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW went to THE HOUSE and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 'd sit with THESE INDIAN AND WHITE CHILDREN , and like THE WAY THINGS , but when THE HOUSE came to SCHOOL AND CHURCH , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW went to A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW church , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON went to mine .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW went to SCHOOL AND CHURCH , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON went to mine .
So when YOU say YOU were born in SCOTLAND COUNTY , did YOU sort of grow up SORT OF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MAXTON or was SORT OF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MAXTON in THE TOWN ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE .
Do A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know anything about MAXTON CITY ?
Not really .
Well , anyway , when A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW leave LUMBERTON , Highway 74 and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW get almost to MAXTON CITY .
Now that they got A BYPASS GOING AROUND .
A BYPASS GOING AROUND goes right straight down through MAXTON CITY .
The stop light 's here , and about a block and a half from the stop light on the other side is SCOTLAND COUNTY , and about a half a mile from there MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was born .
Okay .
In SCOTLAND COUNTY .
So SCOTLAND COUNTY really was just as close into town as -
As any place , any place in THE ROBESON COUNTY .
Right .
Right .
THE ROBESON COUNTY 's THE ROBESON COUNTY , THE TOWN is situated .
Did YOU run into THE DIFFERENCES that YOU remember between SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT GREW UP IN THE COUNTY AND GREW UP IN THE TOWN ? Were there , MALINDA MAYNOR do n't know , ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES OR ATTITUDE DIFFERENCES THAT YOU REMEMBER ?
Yeah , cause even though MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was just , SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT GREW UP IN THE COUNTY AND GREW UP IN THE TOWN call THE ROBESON COUNTY blocks now , but maybe about MAYBE A MILE FROM THE TOWN , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was considered country .
And THE CITY KIDS , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'll say , yeah , that made A DIFFERENCE when A DIFFERENCE came to school .
But the only difference was THE CITY KIDS had less than SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT GREW UP IN THE COUNTY AND GREW UP IN THE TOWN did .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON found that out later though , because MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON used to trade MY SAUSAGE BISCUIT for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with stale bread , so A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was A LITTLE stupid .
THE -LSB- LAUGHTER
But MY GRANDMOTHER did n't buy bread .
MY GRANDMOTHER made THE -LSB- LAUGHTER .
MY GRANDMOTHER made corn bread and MY GRANDMOTHER made biscuits .
THE TWO BREADS THAT YOU GOT , ONE OR THE OTHER , FOR BREAKFAST , LUNCH , OR DINNER was THE TWO BREADS THAT YOU GOT , ONE OR THE OTHER , FOR BREAKFAST , LUNCH , OR DINNER .
THE TWO BREADS THAT YOU GOT , ONE OR THE OTHER , FOR BREAKFAST , LUNCH , OR DINNER 's what A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW got .
But THE CITY KIDS , THE CITY KIDS had THE CITY KIDS own light bread as we called THE TWO back then , and peanut butter and jelly .
THE CITY KIDS 's what THE CITY KIDS 'd have for lunch .
And MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'd have A NICE JUICY SAUSAGE BISCUIT .
Well , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON got A NICE JUICY SAUSAGE BISCUIT all the time so A NICE JUICY SAUSAGE BISCUIT was n't A NICE JUICY SAUSAGE BISCUIT to MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , so MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'd trade MY SAUSAGE BISCUIT for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich .
A NICE JUICY SAUSAGE BISCUIT 's interesting .
And WE even brought milk to school , a little pint of milk .
WE 'd bring WE own milk to drink .
THE FIRST TOOTH I REMEMBER LOSING , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON drank THE FIRST TOOTH I REMEMBER LOSING with OUR OWN MILK for lunch .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was so afraid MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON would n't let nobody pull THE FIRST TOOTH I REMEMBER LOSING .
THAT DAY AT LUNCH TIME after MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'd finished eating and drank OUR OWN MILK MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON realized THE FIRST TOOTH I REMEMBER LOSING was gone .
So in the colored schools as they called THAT DAY AT LUNCH TIME , THE ROBESON COUNTY and the city children went to the same school ?
Was that true of THE WHITE SCHOOLS and the Indian schools that YOU remember ?
Well , THAT DAY AT LUNCH TIME 's according to how far out in THE COUNTRY A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW lived .
Okay .
Because THEY had LITTLE SCHOOLS out in DIFFERENT AREAS DIFFERENT AREAS did not come to this main school until THEY was in EIGHTH grade .
Once THEY completed EIGHTH grade then THEY came .
1970 was 1970 .
But WE had LITTLE SCHOOLS out at Floral College .
WE had schools in Shannon .
WE had schools in Wakulla .
WE had schools in Piney Grove , Alma , Evans Crossing , and all these little different places around MAXTON CITY .
Midway was another one that had the one room schools that took care of THEM FIRST OF ALL grade all the way through the EIGHTH grade .
Then when A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW go to EIGHTH grade A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW came to ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL or had BUSES .
BUSES brought THEM in from THE COUNTRY .
See , by MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON only living like MAYBE A MILE FROM THE TOWN MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was like a go between , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did n't have to go to those smaller schools to begin with .
MALINDA MAYNOR see .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON went to THE MAIN SCHOOLS from THE BEGINNING .
So TALK ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL THEN WHEN YOU FIRST REALIZED THAT YOU WERE BLACK AND POOR .
What was TALK ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL THEN WHEN YOU FIRST REALIZED THAT YOU WERE BLACK AND POOR that - ?
Well , at ONE TIME MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON had a pretty good voice , at least they said MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON always sang alto , and WE had A GLEE CLUB .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON know A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 've heard of glee clubs .
MALINDA MAYNOR used to sing in one .
WE had A GLEE CLUB , and WE was very excited about A GLEE CLUB .
THIS WHITE GIRL-BACKING up on the story a bit .
THIS WHITE GIRL THAT HAD PLAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY had a store in MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY .
Played with MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , even spent NIGHTS at THE HOUSE .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON spent NIGHTS at THE HOUSE when WE were growing up .
THIS WHITE GIRL THAT HAD PLAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY 's the one that made MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON realize that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was different .
What happened was , WE were invited over to THE WHITE SCHOOL to sing a program .
Well , WE got there maybe thirty minutes before ONE TIME , and WE all was in the back , in the auditorium behind the curtains .
THIS WHITE GIRL THAT HAD PLAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY was standing there talking to A FRIEND OF HERS , A WHITE FRIEND .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON walked up to THIS WHITE GIRL THAT HAD PLAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY and tapped THIS WHITE GIRL THAT HAD PLAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY like A FRIEND OF HERS , A WHITE FRIEND , `` HEY SARAH LIB , '' because HER NAME was Sarah Elizabeth , but WE called HER SARAH LIB .
THIS WHITE GIRL THAT HAD PLAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY did n't say anything .
So MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON tapped THIS WHITE GIRL THAT HAD PLAYED WITH ME ALL MY LIFE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD , HER DADDY .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , `` What 's wrong , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do n't know nobody anymore ? '' MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , `` This is MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON . ''
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , `` `` HEY SARAH LIB . ''
`` HEY SARAH LIB said , `` Come HERE A MINUTE . ''
`` HEY SARAH LIB excused `` HEY SARAH LIB from this other girl , and `` HEY SARAH LIB called MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON over in the corner .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was thinking there was some juicy gossip that `` HEY SARAH LIB wants to tell MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , because A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know , when A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're thirteen , fourteen that 's all A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know is gossip .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , `` What 's A MATTER OF FACT ? '' `` HEY SARAH LIB said , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 've got something to tell A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW . ''
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , `` What is A MATTER OF FACT ? '' `` HEY SARAH LIB said , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON daddy say MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON ca n't play with A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW no more , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON ca n't go to YOUR HOUSE , BAR NONE no more .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON can not associate with A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW no more because A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're black , and he do n't want MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON to associate with no black people . ''
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON says , `` Oh , really ? MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON done changed colors . ''
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was THIS COLOR all the time . ''
SHE said , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON know . ''
SHE said , `` THIS COLOR ai n't MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON fault . ''
SHE said , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't want A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW to be angry with MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON have to do what MY FATHER says . ''
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON says , `` FINE WITH ME , '' but FINE WITH ME broke MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON heart .
But MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said to SHE , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , `` Fine with MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON . ''
So FINE WITH ME 's when MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON realized that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was black , and SHE was white , and FRIENDS ANY LONGER BECAUSE HER PARENT 'S WOULD N'T ALLOW IT could not be FRIENDS ANY LONGER BECAUSE HER PARENT 'S WOULD N'T ALLOW IT .
How did FINE WITH ME affect YOU after FINE WITH ME ?
FINE WITH ME put a stigma on MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , really , FINE WITH ME did .
But MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON guess MY GRANDMOTHER carried MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON though at lot of the bad things that was said and done to A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was growing up because MY GRANDMOTHER was white .
MY GRANDMOTHER carried MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON through A LOT OF THINGS .
MY GRANDMOTHER always told MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , `` Do n't ever let anybody make A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW feel inferior , '' MY GRANDMOTHER said , `` because they ca n't do A LOT OF THINGS without A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW consent . ''
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 've never forgotten that .
MY GRANDMOTHER says , `` A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 've got to consent to A LOT OF THINGS . ''
MY GRANDMOTHER said , `` So , HER DADDY do n't want MY GRANDMOTHER to deal with A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW any longer .
A LOT OF THINGS does n't make A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW any different .
A LOT OF THINGS does n't make A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW be any less , and A LOT OF THINGS does n't make MY GRANDMOTHER be any more , but A LOT OF THINGS 's just one of the lessons that A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW have to learn as A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're going on , that there are always going to be PREJUDICED PEOPLE . ''
Then MY GRANDMOTHER started telling MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON stories about how MY GRANDMOTHER used to have to sit on THE PORCH AT NIGHT with the gun to protect YOUR GRANDFATHER AS WELL from THE KU KLUX KLAN because YOUR GRANDFATHER AS WELL was black .
PREJUDICED PEOPLE would n't bother MY GRANDMOTHER , but PREJUDICED PEOPLE wanted YOUR GRANDFATHER AS WELL .
And PREJUDICED PEOPLE 'd tell MY GRANDMOTHER , `` Why are A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW always sitting on THE PORCH AT NIGHT ? WE came after Emanuel .
WE do n't want A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW . ''
MY GRANDMOTHER 'd tell PREJUDICED PEOPLE , `` Well , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW have to come by MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON FIRST OF ALL . ''
Then one got smart and says , `` A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW ca n't kill WE all . ''
MY GRANDMOTHER said , `` No , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON got THE TWO shells in this double barrel shotgun , and AT LEAST TWO OF THEM will be down when AT LEAST TWO OF THEM 's over . ''
PREJUDICED PEOPLE never bothered MY GRANDMOTHER , but HE had to work on the farm during THAT DAY AT LUNCH TIME so HE could n't sit up all night dealing with THE KU KLUX KLAN .
MY GRANDMOTHER sounds like an amazing person .
MY GRANDMOTHER was to MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON .
MY GRANDMOTHER was a strong influence on YOU .
Yeah , very , very .
Was MY GRANDMOTHER raised in THE ROBESON COUNTY , or THE SCOTLAND ROBESON AREA ?
UM-HUM .
Yeah .
And YOU grandfather as well ?
YOUR GRANDFATHER AS WELL was from SOUTH CAROLINA .
Okay .
SOUTH CAROLINA 's like a lot of OUR people , INDIAN PEOPLE , too , came to THE SCOTLAND ROBESON AREA from SOUTH CAROLINA .
Well , tell OUR about the rest of YOU high school education .
Well , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did like a lot of YOUNG GIRLS .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON thought MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was in love , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON got married when MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was in the eleventh grade , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did not get MY DIPLOMA .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was n't pregnant , but in THOSE DAYS IF A YOUNG LADY GOT PREGNANT OR GOT MARRIED BEFORE SHE GOT HER DIPLOMA , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW did n't get THOSE DAYS IF A YOUNG LADY GOT PREGNANT OR GOT MARRIED BEFORE SHE GOT HER DIPLOMA .
YOUNG GIRLS cut THOSE DAYS IF A YOUNG LADY GOT PREGNANT OR GOT MARRIED BEFORE SHE GOT HER DIPLOMA off .
Now THOSE DAYS IF A YOUNG LADY GOT PREGNANT OR GOT MARRIED BEFORE SHE GOT HER DIPLOMA if A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're pregnant A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW can go back and get MY DIPLOMA .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW can even get married and finish YOUR SCHOOLING , but back then A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW could n't .
So YOUR SCHOOLING 's what kept MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON from getting a diploma from 1970 .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON decided MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON wanted to get married .
Big mistake , but WE all make them , do n't WE ?
WE sure do .
Then again , THE ONLY TWO THAT I EVER HAD was n't such a great one because THE TWO CHILDREN that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON have came from that marriage .
THE ONLY TWO THAT I EVER HAD 's THE ONLY TWO THAT I EVER HAD .
Is YOU son the oldest ?
When was YOUR SON born ?
Where ?
When .
Oh , forty-seven .
Nineteen forty-seven .
Okay .
So then YOU got involved in THE SCHOOL SYSTEM in the 1950s then , pretty early .
Tell us then some of the early things YOU remember about working with YOU children in THE MAIN SCHOOLS .
Well , BOTH OF MY KIDS graduated from a segregated school .
BOTH OF MY KIDS had not integrated THE MAIN SCHOOLS yet , because YOUR SON had graduated in MAYBE SIXTY-SEVEN , and MY DAUGHTER 'S MY DAUGHTER 'S graduated in SIXTY-NINE .
As A MATTER OF FACT MY DAUGHTER 'S class was THE LAST ALL BLACK CLASS FROM-AND THEY HAD CHANGED THEIR NAME FROM ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL TO R. B. DEAN , BECAUSE I DID N'T TELL YOU THAT PART .
When BOTH OF MY KIDS integrated THE MAIN SCHOOLS the white people in MAXTON CITY burned down MAXTON CITY , and BOTH OF MY KIDS had to rebuild another school .
After THE LAST ALL BLACK CLASS FROM-AND THEY HAD CHANGED THEIR NAME FROM ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL TO R. B. DEAN , BECAUSE I DID N'T TELL YOU THAT PART , as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON say , of BLACKS went out in SIXTY-NINE , then SIXTY-NINE 's when BLACKS changed THE LAST ALL BLACK CLASS FROM-AND THEY HAD CHANGED THEIR NAME FROM ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL TO R. B. DEAN , BECAUSE I DID N'T TELL YOU THAT PART to AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL , and BLACKS built TOWNSEND MIDDLE SCHOOL .
Right .
For , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON guess around four years , BLACKS AND WHITES went to the all-white high school
THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL is THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL .
Yeah , THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL .
BLACKS AND WHITES all went to 1970 .
Do YOU remember WHAT YEAR THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED GOING THERE ?
BLACKS AND WHITES integrated in , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON believe 1970 was 1970 .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON think 1970 was until seventy-five BLACKS AND WHITES all went to THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL .
Then BLACKS AND WHITES claimed that THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL was too old , and THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL was too dilapidated .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know what MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm saying .
BLACKS AND WHITES were saying that THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL was outdated , and THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL 's when BLACKS AND WHITES all come together with this business about putting 1970 out here in the middle of PURNELL SWETT WHERE IT WAS .
PURNELL SWETT WHERE IT WAS
Yeah .
THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL was West Robeson at A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS .
Yeah , um-hum , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was n't able to understand that , because THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL was THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'd heard of THIS SCHOOL IN IT THEY 'd named after a person , and THEY 're still living .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON thought A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW did THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL after death , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON got a wake up call .
Not in THE ROBESON COUNTY .
Anyway , there was a big discrepancy on THE ROBESON COUNTY because from the beginning-Maxton held out for quite a while .
THEY wanted THEY school on -LSB- Highway -RSB- 130 like going towards ROWLAND .
There was A BIG AREA OUT THERE OWNED BY BUDDY DUNN THAT HE HAD SAID HE WOULD DONATE FOR A HIGH SCHOOL .
But OUR OFFICIALS , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't know what happened , but OUR OFFICIALS gave in because OUR OFFICIALS was asking all the different towns to come together for this big school .
Just THE WORST MISTAKE THEY EVER MADE BECAUSE LUMBERTON HELD OUT was THE WORST MISTAKE THEY EVER MADE BECAUSE LUMBERTON HELD OUT .
RED SPRINGS held out , so OUR OFFICIALS got OUR OFFICIALS own high school , but the other towns that did n't go to PURNELL SWETT WHERE IT WAS is going to South SCOTLAND ROBESON , as A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know .
And RED SPRINGS 's just too MANY KIDS IN ONE PLACE .
Yeah .
Let RED SPRINGS go back a little bit to when the FIRST OF ALL sort of rumblings , MALINDA MAYNOR guess , about having to desegregate THE MAIN SCHOOLS began .
When was that in Maxton ? When did PEOPLE FIRST TALK ABOUT IT ? DO YOU remember ?
THE BIGGEST TALK ABOUT IT was like in MAYBE SIXTY-SEVEN .
What brought THE BIGGEST TALK ABOUT IT on ?
PEOPLE FIRST TALK ABOUT IT ? DO started to talk about THE BIGGEST TALK ABOUT IT .
PEOPLE FIRST TALK ABOUT IT ? DO were having MEETINGS , really , about this .
There were , PREJUDICE WHITE PEOPLE IN MAXTON , PREJUDICE WHITE PEOPLE IN MAXTON , that would rather die than see MAXTON CITY happen .
MAXTON CITY 's MAXTON CITY .
A SAD STORY .
A SAD STORY . 's true , but A SAD STORY . 's sad .
We had A WHITE TEACHER , A WHITE TEACHER , Mr.-I wo n't give A WHITE TEACHER name-in MAXTON CITY .
In A PUBLIC TOWN MEETING A WHITE TEACHER said A WHITE TEACHER 'd rather see A WHITE TEACHER kids dead than to see MANY KIDS IN ONE PLACE in school with a nigger .
A PUBLIC TOWN MEETING 's A PUBLIC TOWN MEETING .
And THE SAD PART ABOUT THIS , WHEN THEY GOT OUT FOR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS , guess what ? BOTH OF HIS KIDS got killed in an accident , and BOTH OF HIS KIDS was driving the car .
HIS WIFE , HIS WIFE just completely lost THE SAD PART ABOUT THIS , WHEN THEY GOT OUT FOR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS , became A MENTAL CASE .
But A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW have to be real careful what A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW say out YOUR MOUTH , because MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON would n't have wished that on BOTH OF HIS KIDS in no kind of way even though BOTH OF HIS KIDS was saying YOUR MOUTH against PREJUDICE WHITE PEOPLE IN MAXTON .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON would n't have wished that on BOTH OF HIS KIDS .
But BOTH OF HIS KIDS said YOUR MOUTH , and this happened , and then MOSTLY PEOPLE say there 's no God .
There is A GOD .
There is A GOD .
YOUR MOUTH 's terrible .
WE had QUITE A FEW , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'll say prominent folk in MAXTON CITY , that WE did n't even know or had NO THOUGHTS THAT THEY WERE MEMBERS OF KU KLUX KLAN until THE RIOT that QUITE A FEW had .
What was MAXTON CITY ?
MAXTON CITY 's when WE found out A LOT OF THEM , WE call QUITE A FEW the bigwigs of MAXTON CITY , was really Ku Klux Klansmen because QUITE A FEW ran so hard QUITE A FEW ran right out of QUITE A FEW white sheets , and everybody knew who QUITE A FEW were .
MAXTON CITY 's right .
How did AFRICAN-AMERICANS feel about AFRICAN-AMERICANS ?
WE loved AFRICAN-AMERICANS .
WE loved AFRICAN-AMERICANS .
This time MALINDA MAYNOR 'm just going to say for the tape recorder that WE 're talking about THE 1957 , or eight , rout MALINDA MAYNOR guess , of THE KU KLUX KLAN .
Yeah .
It was a THE KU KLUX KLAN rally THEY was proposing to have , and this prejudiced man , as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , let THEY have A BIG AREA OUT THERE OWNED BY BUDDY DUNN THAT HE HAD SAID HE WOULD DONATE FOR A HIGH SCHOOL , Gaddy 's Mill , and the word got around .
THEY was n't out in the open , but a lot of black folk contributed to that clash that went on because THEY kept the Indian people in PEMBROKE , '' NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT PEMBROKE aware of what was going on , and when PEMBROKE , '' NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT PEMBROKE was going on , and how PEMBROKE , '' NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT PEMBROKE was planned , and got PEMBROKE , '' NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT PEMBROKE all together .
And on THAT BIG NIGHT THAT BIG NIGHT exploded , so everybody was happy .
UM-HUM .
UM-HUM . did seem to benefit everybody , but AFRICAN-AMERICANS have never gotten credit .
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , but there were A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , and nobody paid THEM any attention because THEM felt like , `` Hey , we do n't have to worry about THEM . ''
But , as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON told A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW earlier , up until MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'll say the last thirty years BLACKS and Indians were together .
After MARTIN LUTHER KING-IT 'S LIKE I tell A LOT OF THEM NOW-MARTIN LUTHER KING DID N'T JUST HELP BLACK FOLK , MARTIN LUTHER KING-IT 'S LIKE I helped all poor folk , Indian and white , whether MOSTLY PEOPLE want to realize A LOT OF THEM NOW-MARTIN LUTHER KING DID N'T JUST HELP BLACK FOLK or not .
With THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING , `` A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do n't deal with BLACKS because A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW are better than BLACKS . ''
Saying that to THE INDIANS ?
Yes .
Because BLACKS felt like if WE stayed together as WE were back in THE 30S and THE 40S WE could take over because WE 'd be so strong .
There 's strength in numbers , so what is BLACKS motto ? Divide and conquer .
Right .
Would YOU go back A LITTLE BIT and talk about THE 30S and THE 40S and how THE INDIANS AND THE BLACKS were , what kinds of THOSE THINGS THE 30S AND THE 40S were doing together , what A LITTLE BIT really meant ?
Well , THEM INDIAN PEOPLE STAY OVER THERE worked on the farms together .
THEM INDIAN PEOPLE STAY OVER THERE nourished each other 's children together .
THEM INDIAN PEOPLE STAY OVER THERE took care of each other 's sick folk .
THEM INDIAN PEOPLE STAY OVER THERE visited each other 's homes .
THEM INDIAN PEOPLE STAY OVER THERE were just , THEM INDIAN PEOPLE STAY OVER THERE were A COMMUNITY .
It was n't THEM INDIAN PEOPLE STAY OVER THERE , and THOSE BLACK FOLKS stay over there , and THOSE BLACK FOLKS never come together , but THEM INDIAN PEOPLE STAY OVER THERE all came together on everything .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON remember MISS EDITH LOCKLEAR .
MISS EDITH LOCKLEAR had SOME BOYS .
SOME BOYS liked to drink .
On SATURDAY AFTERNOON SOME BOYS would come by YOUR HOUSE , BAR NONE .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW .
SOME BOYS called SATURDAY AFTERNOON A HOOVER BUGGY .
SATURDAY AFTERNOON was SATURDAY AFTERNOON .
SATURDAY AFTERNOON had THE TWO wheels on SATURDAY AFTERNOON like car wheels on SATURDAY AFTERNOON , but SATURDAY AFTERNOON was SATURDAY AFTERNOON on THE TOP .
THE HORSE pulled SATURDAY AFTERNOON .
THEY called SATURDAY AFTERNOON A HOOVER BUGGY .
Just as THEY 'd get by OUR house there was the railroad tracks .
And when THEY 'd go across the railroad tracks THEY 'd be so high that when THEY hit the railroad track THEY 'd fall off A HOOVER BUGGY and THE HORSE would go on home which was n't too far up from OUR house .
MY GRANDPA AND MY GRANDMA would go out there and help MY GRANDPA AND MY GRANDMA out of the ditch , bring MY GRANDPA AND MY GRANDMA home to OUR house , give MY GRANDPA AND MY GRANDMA black coffee and all kinds of THOSE THINGS to try to get MY GRANDPA AND MY GRANDMA together before MY GRANDPA AND MY GRANDMA 'd send MY GRANDPA AND MY GRANDMA home .
Then MY GRANDPAPA , MY GRANDPAPA 'd go home with MY GRANDPA AND MY GRANDMA .
MY GRANDPAPA said , `` Let MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON take SOME BOYS on up to MISS EDITH LOCKLEAR because MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON know MISS EDITH LOCKLEAR 's wondering .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 've seen the mule up there for MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't know how long , and SOME BOYS 's sitting down here , '' and take SOME BOYS home .
So there was A LOT OF COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION ?
Yeah , yeah .
As MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON say , A LOT OF COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION was like A COMMUNITY should be .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW were concerned about what happens to MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm concerned about what happens to A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW .
If there was anything going wrong at YOUR HOUSE , BAR NONE , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm hurting too .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know , YOUR HOUSE , BAR NONE 's YOUR HOUSE , BAR NONE , really .
WE did n't have too many white neighbors .
As MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON say , THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME was THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME .
MY FATHER had a little store where MY FATHER sold little groceries which was n't A LOT because MOST PEOPLE raised THEIR OWN .
THE ONLY THINGS WE BOUGHT FROM THE STORE was THE ONLY THINGS WE BOUGHT FROM THE STORE .
So YOU grandparents ran THEIR MAIN OCCUPATION ? THEIR MAIN OCCUPATION was MY GRANDPARENTS main occupation ?
Yeah , and MY GRANDMA would put things-at that ONE TIME WE did n't have freezers .
MY GRANDPARENTS canned everything .
MY GRANDMA canned a lot of vegetables during the summer , and then MY GRANDPARENTS 'd kill THE HOGS in the fall , and MY GRANDPARENTS had a smoke house full of meat .
MY GRANDPARENTS had chickens on the yard .
A few turkeys , and plenty of THE HOGS .
So what do YOU think made YOU want to get so involved in YOU children 's education and THE SCHOOL SYSTEM ?
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON just had a feeling that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON needed to be there .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know , from the very beginning because MY GRANDMOTHER , MY GRANDMOTHER had a stroke when MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was like seven , eight years old .
MY GRANDMOTHER did n't come to 1970 , but MY GRANDMOTHER 'd always ask A WHITE TEACHER or THE PRINCIPAL to stop by to see THE PRINCIPAL so THE PRINCIPAL could find out FIRST OF ALL hand what was going on with MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON at the school house , if A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know what MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON mean .
When MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON grew up NO THOUGHTS THAT THEY WERE MEMBERS OF KU KLUX KLAN , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON jumped up and got married just before graduating .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did n't get a college education , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm going to do MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON best to see THE TWO CHILDREN get everything that THE TWO CHILDREN are capable of . ''
And MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON learned A SAYING , `` A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW can lead a horse to water , but A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW ca n't make A SAYING drink . ''
Well , THEIR MOTTO was , `` If A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW hold A SAYING head under water long enough A SAYING 'll either drink THEIR MOTTO or drown . ''
Right .
THEIR MOTTO sounds like YOUR PARENTS .
So the only way that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON could see that THIS happened was to be right there , to find out how much homework A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW got .
Let MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON see YOUR HOMEWORK .
If A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW need MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON to help A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW can holler , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know , be available .
And as THIS got older , like MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON tell everybody now , `` Do n't drop A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW child when YOUR HOMEWORK gets in middle school .
THIS 's when THIS need A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW most . ''
Because THE MOST peer PRESSURE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL is horrendous .
Nobody knows but THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME .
So do n't drop THE MOST off , and forget THE MOST , and feel like THE MOST can make PRESSURE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW need to stay right with THAT CHILD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL until the graduation from THEIR OWN HIGH SCHOOL through the graduation of THE COLLEGE WHEN NORTH CAROLINA CAME IN AND SAYS .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW need to be there .
If THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME goes away from THEIR HOME A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW still can be a part of what goes on with THE MOST .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW can visit THE COLLEGE WHEN NORTH CAROLINA CAME IN AND SAYS , and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW can let THE MOST know that A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW are behind THE MOST and what A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW expect of THE MOST .
And A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 'd be surprised .
THE MOST usually come through for A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW , but THE COLLEGE WHEN NORTH CAROLINA CAME IN AND SAYS takes A LOT from A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW ca n't just expect THE COLLEGE WHEN NORTH CAROLINA CAME IN AND SAYS to happen by doing nothing .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW have a part to do also .
What kinds of conditions did YOU find YOU children in during THE MOST elementary , and middle school , and high school years ? What was 1970 like , and how did THEIR ELEMENTARY compare with THE OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE AREA ?
Well it was JUST THE NORMAL THINGS that MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON felt like JUST THE NORMAL THINGS happened in school is there were some teachers that really was concerned , and there was some that was just there for THE JOB .
There were bullies JUST THE NORMAL THINGS would be picking on THE TWO CHILDREN , and then there were OTHERS that A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW would love for A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW child to be friends with because OTHERS wanted to do something in life , and OTHERS 's what A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW wanted A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW child to do also .
But A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW had to be like a steering committee in THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW could n't just come out and say , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't want A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW dealing with so , and so , and so .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON want A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW to deal with SO AND SO . ''
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW could n't say that , but A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW were like a little steering committee in THE BACK , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do n't force SO AND SO , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW just nudge SO AND SO .
Nudge SO AND SO A LITTLE BIT until A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW get SO AND SO to where A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW want SO AND SO to be .
And MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON never let THE TWO CHILDREN hang out in THE STREET .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did n't let MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON hang out in THE STREET .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON did n't let MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON either .
A LOT OF RACISM
We always had CHORES .
When MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was growing up A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW had CHORES .
When A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW come from school A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW had to get in wood .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW had to get in coal , WATER , MAYBE EVEN SWEEP THE YARDS or whatever .
Feed THE CHICKENS .
Feed THE HOGS , but there was something that A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW had to do .
Once WATER , MAYBE EVEN SWEEP THE YARDS got dark A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW come inside .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW ate YOUR DINNER .
We called YOUR DINNER supper at A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW got out YOUR HOMEWORK , and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW went to bed .
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL was THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL .
So when THE CITY KIDS came along THOSE THINGS were A LITTLE better , and THE CITY KIDS did n't have as many chores as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON had when MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was growing up , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON made sure that THE CITY KIDS had enough that THE CITY KIDS did n't have a lot of idle time because grandma said , `` Idle mind is THE DEVIL 'S workshop , '' so A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW have to keep THE CITY KIDS busy .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON think THE CITY KIDS 's what happens to A LOT OF OUR CHILDREN today .
THE CITY KIDS do n't have enough to keep THE CITY KIDS occupied .
YOUR PARENTS buy all the conveniences for YOUR PARENTS , and YOUR PARENTS 're out there working trying to pay for all of this , and what THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME really wants is YOUR MAMA 'S , not what THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME can buy for THE DEVIL 'S .
Because , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW think about A LOT OF OUR CHILDREN .
Come home from school , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW have a lot of LATCHKEY KIDS we call LATCHKEY KIDS .
LATCHKEY KIDS come home from school .
There 's NOBODY THERE BUT THE TELEVISION , SO WHATEVER 'S on there , NOBODY THERE BUT THE TELEVISION , SO WHATEVER 'S watch THE TELEVISION .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW buy HBO .
NOBODY THERE BUT THE TELEVISION , SO WHATEVER 'S watch HBO .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW watch CINEMAX .
NOBODY THERE BUT THE TELEVISION , SO WHATEVER 'S can watch CINEMAX .
And the same thing with THE COMPUTER .
There is A LOT OF PORNOGRAPHY ON THE COMPUTER .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do n't want NOBODY THERE BUT THE TELEVISION , SO WHATEVER 'S to see THOSE THINGS , do n't have A LOT OF PORNOGRAPHY ON THE COMPUTER there available for NOBODY THERE BUT THE TELEVISION , SO WHATEVER 'S .
Yeah .
Was A LOT OF PORNOGRAPHY ON THE COMPUTER all black teachers at 1970 when YOU kids were going there ?
Yeah , and THE PRINCIPAL , TOO .
UM-HUM .
Did YOU find YOU looking around and saying , `` Well , TOO do n't have such and such that THE WHITE SCHOOL has , or this other thing that THE WHITE SCHOOL has ? '' Or was that not even really AN ISSUE ?
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON heard THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE , but if it was THE TWO CHILDREN WE just made do with what WE had .
WE did n't get to visit THE OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE AREA to make a comparison .
THE -LSB- LAUGHTER
But THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE did because THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE 'd have A WHITE TEACHER meeting , or whatever .
THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE 'd have to go over there for one reason or another , and THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE would see what was going on , but WE , as THE TWO CHILDREN , WE did n't see THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE .
In THE 1960S THE 1960S sounds like WHITE PARENTS were organizing against integration .
WHITE PARENTS were .
What were THE BLACK PARENTS ?
Praying A LOT .
THE -LSB- LAUGHTER
Because FIRST OF ALL , in the town of MAXTON CITY what THE BLACK PARENTS started doing automatically even before THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING got there was some of THE BLACK PARENTS did n't have CASH MONEY .
THE BLACK PARENTS were selling parts of THE BLACK PARENTS land and properties to get CASH MONEY to send THE BLACK PARENTS child to A PRIVATE SCHOOL .
THESE are WHITE PARENTS ?
And THESE started investigating the nearest private school THESE could send THESE child to .
So by THE TIME THAT SCHOOLS WAS REALLY INTEGRATED AND THEY STARTED GOING TO SCHOOL TOGETHER , the only people mostly at school was Indian and black .
THESE had done weeded THESE children out beforehand .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW might find one , THE TWO , or MAYBE THREE WHITE KIDS IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL .
But by THE TIME THEY GOT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL MAYBE THREE WHITE KIDS IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL was in A PRIVATE SCHOOL .
MAYBE THREE WHITE KIDS IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL was not in THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS any longer .
What were some of THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AROUND HERE ?
The closest one was Flora McDonald .
In RED SPRINGS ?
In RED SPRINGS .
Did ROWLAND have ONE or Fairmont ?
If ONE did , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't know about ONE .
Okay .
So THE BLACK PARENTS were praying for ONE to happen .
Were there any blacks that YOU remember that resisted ONE ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE
Not really .
Because THEIR hopes was everybody would be on AN EQUAL SCALE as far as education was concerned because WE knew that WE were on the bottom rung when AN EQUAL SCALE came to materials for education , so THEIR felt like if AN EQUAL SCALE was integrated THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME would get the same quality education as A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW child would get because WE 'd have the same tools .
But WE find out now that THE MAIN SCHOOLS are integrated THEIR 're still not giving WE THE TOOLS WE NEED .
Are THE TOOLS WE NEED still kept for HIGH SCHOOLS - ?
Yeah .
- and predominantly THE WHITE SCHOOLS ?
And how does that SYSTEM WORK ?
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS just is not getting SYSTEM WORK .
SYSTEM WORK 's not getting SYSTEM WORK .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm not a gambling person of any sort , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON just feel like OUR LEGISLATORS are keeping YOU THAT DO N'T EVER PICK UP A BIBLE OR EVEN GO TO A CHURCH , AND DO N'T EVEN CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER down to A POINT because A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 've got THE LOTTERY in VIRGINIA .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 've got A POINT in SOUTH CAROLINA , and OUR LEGISLATORS just finally got A POINT in TENNESSEE .
YOU THAT DO N'T EVER PICK UP A BIBLE OR EVEN GO TO A CHURCH , AND DO N'T EVEN CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER are surrounded , and the great things that OUR LEGISLATORS 're doing in SOUTH CAROLINA WITH THE LOTTERY as far as education is concerned is tremendous .
OUR LEGISLATORS 're talking about SOUTH CAROLINA WITH THE LOTTERY all the time .
And then OUR LEGISLATORS 're talking about how poor THE ROBESON COUNTY schools are .
OUR LEGISLATORS do n't have THIS , and OUR LEGISLATORS do n't have THIS , and OUR LEGISLATORS ca n't get CASH MONEY from the government , because OUR LEGISLATORS do n't have CASH MONEY to give to YOU THAT DO N'T EVER PICK UP A BIBLE OR EVEN GO TO A CHURCH , AND DO N'T EVEN CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
So why not ? There are MOSTLY PEOPLE .
INSTEAD OF THOSE THAT LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA , OR GOING TO TENNESSEE , OR GOING TO VIRGINIA , leave INSTEAD OF THOSE THAT LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA , OR GOING TO TENNESSEE , OR GOING TO VIRGINIA here , and let INSTEAD OF THOSE THAT LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA , OR GOING TO TENNESSEE , OR GOING TO VIRGINIA help THE TWO CHILDREN because THE TWO CHILDREN really need THE TWO CHILDREN .
But THOSE THAT LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA , OR GOING TO TENNESSEE , OR GOING TO VIRGINIA do n't see INSTEAD OF THOSE THAT LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA , OR GOING TO TENNESSEE , OR GOING TO VIRGINIA like INSTEAD OF THOSE THAT LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA , OR GOING TO TENNESSEE , OR GOING TO VIRGINIA .
Who was that ? Somebody told MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , `` Well , YOU THAT DO N'T EVER PICK UP A BIBLE OR EVEN GO TO A CHURCH , AND DO N'T EVEN CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 'll never get a lottery because A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know THE BIBLE BELT is THE BIBLE BELT . ''
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON says , `` THE BIBLE BELT has got nothing to do with THE BIBLE BELT .
THE BIBLE BELT has nothing to do with A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW religion .
There are PEOPLE THAT LIVE MAYBE NEXT DOOR TO YOU THAT DO N'T EVER PICK UP A BIBLE OR EVEN GO TO A CHURCH , AND DO N'T EVEN CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER , but PEOPLE THAT LIVE MAYBE NEXT DOOR TO YOU THAT DO N'T EVER PICK UP A BIBLE OR EVEN GO TO A CHURCH , AND DO N'T EVEN CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER will go and play THE LOTTERY .
So A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW have to use THE TOOLS WE NEED , whatever ones A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW can get , to BETTER THE SITUATION FOR YOUR CHILDREN . ''
Not everybody wants to better BETTER THE SITUATION FOR YOUR CHILDREN , BETTER THE SITUATION FOR YOUR CHILDREN sounds like .
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON think THE TWO CHILDREN want us to stay in a rut .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW get TOO MANY SMART PEOPLE YOU MIGHT ROOT THEM OUT OF THEIR LITTLE SPOT .
When TOO MANY SMART PEOPLE YOU MIGHT ROOT THEM OUT OF THEIR LITTLE SPOT start demanding THE DIFFERENT THINGS , and THE DIFFERENT THINGS .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Well , let 'S go back A LITTLE BIT to THE 60S again , and tell MALINDA MAYNOR about SOME OF THE THINGS that YOU were doing in MAXTON CITY to push AN ISSUE forward .
Did YOU have MEETINGS ? Was 'S A FORMAL SENSE OF BEING ORGANIZED IN THAT WAY , OR WHAT KINDS OF THINGS WERE HAPPENING ?
Well , THE 60S were having meetings at THE 60S church , at OUR CHURCH , AT THE CHURCH , about BETTER THE SITUATION FOR YOUR CHILDREN .
THE MEETING WE HAD AT THE CHURCH was mainly about getting-once SOME OF THE THINGS were into school integrated already-was getting A HIGH SCHOOL IN MAXTON instead of having to come all the way down , be bused down to PEMBROKE , '' NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT PEMBROKE to school .
But as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON say , THE MEETING WE HAD AT THE CHURCH was like mainly among THE CITIZENS OF MAXTON and THE CITY OFFICIALS OF MAXTON because at THE TIME THEY GOT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL THE 60S city officials was white .
THE 60S only got integrated here in the last few years .
THE CITIZENS OF MAXTON all was white .
And , as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON told A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW before , THE CITIZENS OF MAXTON all had sent THE CITIZENS OF MAXTON children to THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AROUND HERE .
So THE CITIZENS OF MAXTON was n't interested in having A HIGH SCHOOL IN MAXTON .
It was okay with THE CITIZENS OF MAXTON if THE CITIZENS OF MAXTON build ONE BIG SCHOOL , and herd THE CITIZENS OF MAXTON all around in one place .
ONE BIG SCHOOL did n't matter .
So THE TIME THEY GOT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL really was THE TIME THEY GOT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL of feeling hopeless .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON would n't say hopeless , helpless to a certain extent .
Fighting against THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
Right , because WE did n't have anybody in WE stead to speak up , that , `` Yeah , WE need A TIME OF TURMOIL AND STRESS WITH EVERYBODY , and WE need A TIME OF TURMOIL AND STRESS WITH EVERYBODY . ''
A TIME OF TURMOIL AND STRESS WITH EVERYBODY seemed like A TIME OF TURMOIL AND STRESS WITH EVERYBODY was just A TIME OF TURMOIL AND STRESS WITH EVERYBODY .
And so at that time was there still a MAXTON CITY administrative unit for THE MAIN SCHOOLS ? Were there still THE MAXTON CITY SCHOOLS ?
Um-hum , but they were all white .
UM-HUM .
So THE MAXTON CITY SCHOOLS were all white .
The THE MAXTON CITY SCHOOLS committee was all white .
MALINDA MAYNOR see .
The board was all white .
Okay .
Go back and tell US about when THEY burned down THE BLACK HIGH SCHOOL , THE BUILDING PART because MALINDA MAYNOR mentioned that to somebody that MALINDA MAYNOR work with on this project a couple of weeks ago , and THEY were like , `` WHAT ? '' THEY had n't really hard of anything like that happening in NORTH CAROLINA .
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
So tell US from what YOU remember , kind of from beginning to end , who was involved with US , why THE BLACK HIGH SCHOOL , THE BUILDING PART got to that level ?
Well , as A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know , THE RIOT was in fifty-seven .
Which RIOT , THE KKK ?
Yeah , right .
THE MAIN SCHOOLS were burned down in , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON think RIOT , THE KKK ? was SIXTY-NINE .
Nope , RIOT , THE KKK ? was n't SIXTY-NINE .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm getting old .
THOSE THINGS kind of get to HIS HEAD .
Now see , MY DAUGHTER 'S class was THE LAST ALL BLACK CLASS FROM-AND THEY HAD CHANGED THEIR NAME FROM ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL TO R. B. DEAN , BECAUSE I DID N'T TELL YOU THAT PART .
THE LAST ALL BLACK CLASS FROM-AND THEY HAD CHANGED THEIR NAME FROM ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL TO R. B. DEAN , BECAUSE I DID N'T TELL YOU THAT PART was in SIXTY-NINE .
MY DAUGHTER 'S graduated in 1969 .
Yeah .
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE .
MY DAUGHTER 'S graduated in SIXTY-NINE or SIXTY-EIGHT , SIXTY-NINE IN THAT ERA .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON ca n't remember .
SIXTY-NINE 's okay .
We 're dealing with A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS .
A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS was after MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON graduated .
That THE MAIN SCHOOLS were burned down .
That THE MAIN SCHOOLS were burned down .
Yeah , and THEY said A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS -
Okay , tell THEY again .
YOU think A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS was after YOU daughter graduated .
Yeah .
So they had decided to integrate THE MAIN SCHOOLS at A POINT .
Yeah .
So where did THE NEXT CLASS OF HIGH SCHOOLS go , the next class of HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ?
Went to THE WHITE HIGH SCHOOL .
In MAXTON CITY .
Yeah .
THE WHITE HIGH SCHOOL was THE WHITE HIGH SCHOOL after they had burned down R. B. DEAN .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON mean ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL .
Do YOU remember what time of WHAT YEAR THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED GOING THERE WHAT YEAR THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED GOING THERE happened ?
WHAT YEAR THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED GOING THERE was like in JULY or AUGUST .
WHAT YEAR THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED GOING THERE was just before school started .
At A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS school used to start right after Labor Day , but A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS was either JULY or AUGUST that THEY burned 1970 down .
THEY said A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS was A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS , but THEY never was persecuted -LSB- prosecuted -RSB- for A BUNCH OF YOUNG WHITE BOYS .
Okay .
So THEY had already decided to close 1970 and have HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS begin attending THE WHITE HIGH SCHOOL ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , THEY really had n't gotten into the particulars about how THEY was going to do A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , and why .
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE was A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE and a lot of other black folk .
Why would THEY burn the school down if THEY were against integration ? Leave 1970 there , and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 've got a better opportunity of keeping THEY over there .
But for SOME UNCANNY REASON THEY burned SOME UNCANNY REASON down .
THEY could have just been frustrated .
THE YOUNG TEENAGERS did n't know what to do with THE YOUNG TEENAGERS , and listening to all this integration stuff from THE YOUNG TEENAGERS parents in THEIR HOME , with THEIR PARENTS TALKING , and not ever being exposed to having to sit in A CLASSROOM WITH OTHER COLORS OF CHILDREN , or whatever , and THE YOUNG TEENAGERS could have just got all mixed up and confused , and said , `` Well , WE 'll fix THEIR HOME .
WE 'll go burn 1970 down . ''
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW never know , and WE 'll never know , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON guess , what really went through THE YOUNG TEENAGERS minds at THE TIME THAT SCHOOLS WAS REALLY INTEGRATED AND THEY STARTED GOING TO SCHOOL TOGETHER .
The logical thinking to MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was , `` A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do n't want MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON at SCHOOL AND CHURCH , why are A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW going to burn down mine ? Let MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON keep SCHOOL AND CHURCH . ''
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't know .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON really do n't know .
Well tell MALINDA MAYNOR , because PART OF WHAT WE 'RE TRYING TO DO is get a chronology , sort of , of the events in each place , did anybody in MAXTON CITY that YOU remember participate in THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE PROGRAM THAT ROBESON COUNTY HAD IN THE MID 60S , I GUESS , sixty-five , sixty-six .
PART OF WHAT WE 'RE TRYING TO DO 's when MALINDA MAYNOR 'm talking about THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE PROGRAM THAT ROBESON COUNTY HAD IN THE MID 60S , I GUESS .
Is that SOMETHING YOU remember ?
If WE did , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't know anything about SOMETHING YOU .
Okay .
Okay .
So what WE 're taking about then is basically something that occurs in the Maxton City School System .
And YOU did have black students from THE ROBESON COUNTY technically who were attending THE MAXTON CITY SCHOOLS ?
Yeah .
So these decisions about integration affected the county students as well as the city students ?
Right .
Right .
Did THE WHITES in MAXTON CITY try to take A MENTAL CASE to court , or JUST-WHAT exactly did JUST-WHAT try to do to stop MAXTON CITY ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , THE WHITES did n't go to take A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE to court .
THE WHITES just started moving THE WHITES children out .
THE WHITES did n't move THE WHITES , but THE WHITES 'd moved THE WHITES children to THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AROUND HERE .
So THE WHITES saw A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , and said , `` WE 're going to - . ''
Like an undercurrent , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know .
`` Well , WE ca n't stop THIS .
THIS 's going to happen anyway .
WE killed NOW-MARTIN LUTHER KING .
WE did n't help .
WE killed Kennedy .
WE did n't help .
Then WE come back and got Robert .
WE did n't help , so WE 're just going to move all the kids out to THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AROUND HERE . ''
Right .
Then THEY did n't have to worry about IT .
To MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON feel like THEY gave up on THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , but THEY figured , `` Well , WE kids are not going to be in there anyway , so WE 're not going to worry about IT .
Let THE INDIANS and BLACKS fight THE INDIANS out .
THE INDIANS will be THIS SCHOOL IN IT . ''
So in A WAY A WAY 's still segregation because MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't think there 's not one white child at PURNELL SWETT WHERE IT WAS , is there ? .
Not many .
Is there some ?
Well , there must be some , but not many .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't know of any from MAXTON CITY that went there .
There may not be .
There may not be .
MALINDA MAYNOR know there 's SOME AT RED SPRINGS .
Unless SOME AT RED SPRINGS 're to an inter-marriage couple or something , where ONE parent is white and one is black , or one parent is Indian and ONE is white , like ONE .
Children with WHITE PARENTS .
Yeah , MALINDA MAYNOR do n't know .
ONE would be ONE .
ONE would be good to find out .
In NO THOUGHTS THAT THEY WERE MEMBERS OF KU KLUX KLAN , because MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm thinking , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON could be wrong , but there are none there .
Well , that certainly seems consistent with what OPPOSED TO THE ROBESON COUNTY PUBIC SCHOOLS were doing .
THEY were trying to leave THE ISSUE TO FIGHT BETWEEN INDIANS AND BLACKS , TO FIGHT IT OUT ESSENTIALLY .
And THEY seems to have been the logic behind setting up PURNELL SWETT WHERE IT WAS and the schools that fed into THE ISSUE TO FIGHT BETWEEN INDIANS AND BLACKS , TO FIGHT IT OUT ESSENTIALLY , PEMBROKE , '' NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT PEMBROKE , and Prospect , and MAXTON CITY .
YOU 're going to have a definite minority of WHITE KIDS COMING FROM THOSE THREE HIGH SCHOOLS .
Right .
MALINDA MAYNOR find THREE interesting though that as of 1969 when YOU daughter graduated , WHITE KIDS COMING FROM THOSE THREE HIGH SCHOOLS really had n't sorted out where WHITE KIDS COMING FROM THOSE THREE HIGH SCHOOLS were going to go .
THE JUST knew that THE JUST had to go somewhere , and then burning down THE BLACK HIGH SCHOOL , THE BUILDING PART meant that THE JUST had to go to THE WHITE HIGH SCHOOL .
Yeah .
What ' MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm saying , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't know , THE BLACK HIGH SCHOOL , THE BUILDING PART just sounds kind of confusing .
Yeah , sure .
Sure .
Crazy .
If A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do n't want MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON over at YOUR HOUSE , BAR NONE , why burn down THE HOUSE ? A POINT was A POINT .
What do YOU remember about how THE BLACK COMMUNITY felt when 1970 was burned down ?
Well , THEY were devastated because really , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON think , a lot of the prominent blacks in THE TOWN was hoping that THEY could include that school in the process .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know what MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm saying ?
Instead of having to build TOWNSEND MIDDLE SCHOOL , in SOME WAY or another THERE , TOWNSEND MIDDLE SCHOOL could use that building for one of the schools .
THERE , TOWNSEND MIDDLE SCHOOL knew already there was going to be a elementary school , a middle school , and A HIGH SCHOOL and A LOT OF THEM thought because really THE WHITE HIGH SCHOOL , THE BUILDING PART , and THE BLACK HIGH SCHOOL , THE BUILDING PART , MAXTON CITY really was bigger because WE had from FIRST OF ALL grade all the way through twelfth grade .
THE WHITE HIGH SCHOOL only had from EIGHTH grade through ELEVEN .
So THIS SCHOOL IN IT really was n't as big , the size was n't as big .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON think THERE , TOWNSEND MIDDLE SCHOOL was just still in THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DECIDE IF WE CAN AT LEAST INCLUDE THIS SCHOOL IN IT .
Use THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DECIDE IF WE CAN AT LEAST INCLUDE THIS SCHOOL IN IT .
Put THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DECIDE IF WE CAN AT LEAST INCLUDE THIS SCHOOL IN IT to use .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't know if A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW ever heard of the Rosenwalds ? THERE , TOWNSEND MIDDLE SCHOOL built all of those black schools back in THE 30S , and ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL was one of them .
Oh , is that right ?
Okay .
What about SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES .
SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES 's interesting that YOU mentioned some of the leadership in the black community in MAXTON CITY .
Did YOU find ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES OR ATTITUDE DIFFERENCES THAT YOU REMEMBER or other things that caused disagreements , differences of opinion , maybe , in the black community about how THOSE THINGS should be handled and what should happen with integration ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said , THE ONES THAT I KNEW , THAT I GOT ANY FEEDBACK FROM was willing for THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING , but THE ONES THAT I KNEW , THAT I GOT ANY FEEDBACK FROM wanted A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE to be on an even basis .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know what MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm saying .
Right .
THE ONES THAT I KNEW , THAT I GOT ANY FEEDBACK FROM felt that A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE would be better , A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE would make A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE better for the black children if 1970 was integrated so that THE ONES THAT I KNEW , THAT I GOT ANY FEEDBACK FROM could get the equal opportunity in education .
So A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE makes A FORMAL SENSE OF BEING ORGANIZED IN THAT WAY , OR WHAT KINDS OF THINGS WERE HAPPENING to happen , for THE NEW UNIFIED SCHOOL to be ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was one of those that believed THAT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON - .
YOUR SON graduated from MAXTON CITY , and YOUR SON wanted to be a doctor .
Well , FIRST OF ALL of all THAT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON would n't let YOUR SON in at , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON think FIRST OF ALL was FIRST OF ALL .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON ca n't think of HER NAME now .
But anyway , what THAT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON did to YOUR SON , THAT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON accepted YOUR SON without YOUR SON going there .
THAT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON did n't see YOUR SON .
TWO WEEKS BEFORE TIME FOR SCHOOL TO OPEN I took YOUR SON for YOUR SON interview .
When THAT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON realized YOUR SON was black THAT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON cut YOUR SON off just like THAT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON .
Now , TWO WEEKS BEFORE TIME FOR SCHOOL TO OPEN I 's TWO WEEKS BEFORE TIME FOR SCHOOL TO OPEN I before college is opening up to start .
MISS MCDUFFIE
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW might have heard about Laurinburg Institute ?
Well , MISS MCDUFFIE was one of the founders .
MISS MCDUFFIE helped MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON by MISS MCDUFFIE being MISS MCDUFFIE and knowing MOSTLY PEOPLE to get YOUR SON in HOWARD UNIVERSITY , '' AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A TIME , AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A PLACE .
MISS MCDUFFIE made a few phone calls to a few prominent people at 1970 , and three days before 1970 was opened MISS MCDUFFIE called MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON .
MISS MCDUFFIE says , `` Get FRED ready and have FRED at HOWARD UNIVERSITY , '' AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A TIME , AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A PLACE .
`` FRED has been accepted . ''
FRED was accepted , because FRED told MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , `` Mama , if A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW just get MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON in there MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON wo n't let A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW down .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON wo n't let A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW down . ''
FRED even talks about IT now because FRED does a lot of public speaking , how far back in ONE TIME THOSE THREE HIGH SCHOOLS were from the modern schools of THAT DAY AT LUNCH TIME because FRED was in school with KIDS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY , even some came from other countries to this medical school .
FRED said , the things that FRED had to learn and catch up to in college , KIDS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY already did IT in high school .
KIDS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY already did IT in high school , so while KIDS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY were out enjoying KIDS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FRED was burning THE MIDNIGHT OIL TRYING TO KEEP UP .
FRED said IT was like FRED did n't go to school .
But , yet , when FRED graduated from ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL FRED was FRED .
FRED was what KIDS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY call a cum laude something or other .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know what those THE TWO things are .
FRED was all A 'S , an all A student .
FRED said FRED went to HOWARD UNIVERSITY , '' AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A TIME , AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A PLACE and HOWARD UNIVERSITY , '' AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A TIME , AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A PLACE was like FRED was the dumbest thing in the world because A LOT OF THINGS that THOSE CHILDREN THAT WAS THERE WITH HIM had already done in high school , THOSE CHILDREN THAT WAS THERE WITH HIM did n't even give HOWARD UNIVERSITY , '' AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A TIME , AT SUCH-AND-SUCH A PLACE to FRED when FRED was in high school .
Right .
THOSE CHILDREN THAT WAS THERE WITH HIM did n't have , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON guess , THE TOOLS WE NEED or the financial facilities .
FRED said FRED really had to work FRED butt off just to stay even .
FRED says , `` Not ahead of THE NEXT CLASS OF HIGH SCHOOLS , YOUR MAMA 'S . ''
FRED said when THE OTHER KIDS had time to go out and party and enjoy THE OTHER KIDS on the weekend , FRED says , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was burning THE MIDNIGHT OIL TRYING TO KEEP UP .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was catching up to make sure because MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON had promised A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW if A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW got MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON there , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON was n't going to get throwed out . ''
So THE OTHER KIDS was another thing to let MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON know that OUR schools was below par , that THE OTHER KIDS needed A DEVASTATING THING FOR A CHILD TO FEEL LIKE , `` HEY , I 'M SMART , because A DEVASTATING THING FOR A CHILD TO FEEL LIKE , `` HEY , I 'M SMART 's A DEVASTATING THING FOR A CHILD TO FEEL LIKE , `` HEY , I 'M SMART .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm getting all A 'S , '' and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW go to the next level , and THE OTHER KIDS say , `` All A 's for what ? Did A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do so-and-so , or did A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do such-and-such . ''
`` OUR did n't do OUR at OUR school . ''
`` Well , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW got ta get ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL . ''
ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL 's right .
Did a number of blacks from MAXTON CITY go to FIRST OF ALL Was that a common experience ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE
So MOSTLY PEOPLE were n't bringing back - .
MOSTLY PEOPLE was n't giving any feedback .
Yeah .
AT LEAST TO WHERE I DID N'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL MY CHILDREN started going to college .
AT LEAST TO WHERE I DID N'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL MY CHILDREN 's when MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON got THE FEEDBACK from what was going on , that OUR schools was n't what MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON thought AT LEAST TO WHERE I DID N'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL MY CHILDREN was .
Even with MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON staying out there , practically , at school , and trying to keep up with what was going on , and THIS , that , and EACH OTHER , OUR schools still was below par .
THIS was n't up to snuff .
So how do YOU feel about integration now looking back on EACH OTHER ? Is EACH OTHER A SUCCESS ? Is EACH OTHER a failure ? What would YOU say about EACH OTHER ?
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON feel like integration is A SUCCESS , but MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON feel like OUR educational system has deteriorated because during THIS MAXTON HIGH SCHOOL THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE were dedicated .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON mean THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE were dedicated .
THE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE would go to all kinds of lengths to make sure that that child succeeded , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm sure that OUR still have some with that same frame of mind , but the majority is , THE JOB 's THE JOB .
Like MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON got to work THE MORNING .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do so , and so , and so .
When MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON get off , forget THE MORNING .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm done with THE MORNING .
And A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW ca n't do THE MORNING if A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW want to really be MISS MCDUFFIE .
MISS MCDUFFIE got to be with THE MORNING 24/7 .
THE MORNING 's THE MORNING .
But , yeah , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't see anything that went wrong with THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING , THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING 's just the attitudes of the faculties that we have nowadays .
THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING 's THAT SOMETHING or class .
THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING does n't matter because if A WHITE TEACHER is dedicated she 's going to let A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know if something 's going on with A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW child .
THE REASON I SAID THAT , IT WAS N'T ME BUT A COUPLE OF FOLK THAT LIVED IN BACK OF ME HAD CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AT PURNELL SWETT , AND THEY DID N'T EVEN KNOW THEIR CHILD had been in-school suspension for THE TWO long weeks .
And YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE did n't even know THE REASON I SAID THAT , IT WAS N'T ME BUT A COUPLE OF FOLK THAT LIVED IN BACK OF ME HAD CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AT PURNELL SWETT , AND THEY DID N'T EVEN KNOW THEIR CHILD , and THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME failed .
YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE was how YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE found out .
And what happened is , YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE did n't send THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME A NOTE HOME .
The child 's in high school so YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE figured THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME is supposed to go home and tell YOUR PARENTS .
Now , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know , any child that knows that ONE PARENT is on A MENTAL CASE is not going to go home and tell YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE bad news .
What 's wrong with making a phone call ? If A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW ca n't travel make a phone call to ONE PARENT , and tell YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE , `` A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW child is suspended .
YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE 're coming to THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NEW SCHOOL AND THE OLD SCHOOL , but YOUR CHILDREN IN DURING THEIR ELEMENTARY , AND MIDDLE SCHOOL , AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS ? WHAT WAS THE SCHOOL LIKE 're in in-school suspension for the next two weeks . ''
WHAT 's wrong with WHAT ? But WHAT do n't do WHAT .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW child can be in in-school suspension and out , and A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do n't know nothing about THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NEW SCHOOL AND THE OLD SCHOOL unless THAT CHILD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL so desires to tell A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW .
And MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON feel like THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NEW SCHOOL AND THE OLD SCHOOL 's up to the faculty to let ONE PARENT know .
And THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NEW SCHOOL AND THE OLD SCHOOL 's THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NEW SCHOOL AND THE OLD SCHOOL .
THE OLD SCHOOL , A WHITE TEACHER came to YOUR HOUSE , BAR NONE .
THE PRINCIPAL came to YOUR HOUSE , BAR NONE .
And if A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW did something wrong in school , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know who brought A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW home ? THE PRINCIPAL .
THEY caught YOU .
He brought A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW home .
But now THEY leave too much to THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME .
THEY give THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME TOO MUCH LEEWAY , because even in THEIR ELEMENTARY THEY send A NOTE HOME to ONE PARENT .
Well , SOME PARENTS gets TOO MUCH LEEWAY and some parents , some of SOME PARENTS do n't .
TOO MUCH LEEWAY 's according to what the note is about .
THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME might deliver TOO MUCH LEEWAY , and SOME PARENTS might not deliver TOO MUCH LEEWAY , because MY GRANDSON did TOO MUCH LEEWAY to MY GRANDSON mom .
When MY GRANDSON was in THIRD or fourth grade A WHITE TEACHER sent A NOTE HOME .
MY GRANDSON claimed MY GRANDSON forgot THIRD , but A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know , THIRD was bad news .
MY GRANDSON never gave THIRD to HIS MOTHER , but at least A WHITE TEACHER made back up and called HIS MOTHER .
THIRD 's how HIS MOTHER knew , but a lot of times THEY do n't .
THEY just send a note , and THE CITY KIDS is THE CITY KIDS that YOUR PARENTS do less .
A WHITE TEACHER used to tell MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON THEY .
HIS MOTHER says , `` Every time MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON look around MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'm looking at A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW . ''
HIS MOTHER said , `` On THE TOP , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're at every PTA meeting and everything else that 's going on . ''
HIS MOTHER said , `` But YOUR PARENTS that WE really need to see , YOUR PARENTS do n't come . ''
HIS MOTHER said , `` WE send YOUR PARENTS letters to come , but WE never see YOUR PARENTS .
YOUR PARENTS drop the kid off at THE BEGINNING of school and do n't see YOUR PARENTS no more . ''
Maybe THE -LSB- LAUGHTER -RSB- THAT SOMETHING 'S going on .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW need to be visible at least twice a week .
A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW do n't have to go to A CLASSROOM WITH OTHER COLORS OF CHILDREN , but just be visible around 1970 because THE OTHER KIDS are going to tell YOUR KIDS , `` BOY , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 'd better be careful because there 's -LSB- THE -LSB- LAUGHTER down the hall .
YOUR MAMA 'S down there . ''
Not that A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're down there , but SOME WAY 's SOME WAY THE OTHER KIDS put SOME WAY .
SOME WAY lets THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME know , `` MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'd better stay on MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON P 's and Q 's because if MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME 's going to find out . ''
Right .
Well , THE OTHER CHILDREN THAT YOU RAISED , THE OTHER SIX THAT YOU RAISED were THE OTHER CHILDREN THAT YOU RAISED , THE OTHER SIX THAT YOU RAISED .
Yeah .
Yeah .
And all of them was in the integrated schools .
Tell MALINDA MAYNOR before we have to leave THIS , tell MALINDA MAYNOR about how YOU and some of the other members of THE BLACK COMMUNITY reacted to what Indians were doing in the early '70s to fight integration .
What do YOU feel like motivated that , and how did YOU react to THIS at THE TIME THAT SCHOOLS WAS REALLY INTEGRATED AND THEY STARTED GOING TO SCHOOL TOGETHER ?
Well , to me-you want MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON to be honest , do n't A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW ?
Yeah , well sure .
If YOU 're comfortable being honest .
MOST OF THOSE AROUND MAXTON really THOSE AROUND MAXTON did not want THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING .
THOSE AROUND MAXTON felt that what schools THOSE AROUND MAXTON had , THOSE AROUND MAXTON had done MOST OF THOSE AROUND MAXTON on THEIR OWN without the help of the state , and that THOSE AROUND MAXTON should not have to deal with whites or blacks .
NO THOUGHTS THAT THEY WERE MEMBERS OF KU KLUX KLAN was THOSE AROUND MAXTON thoughts , that , `` THOSE AROUND MAXTON did n't care whether WE had an education or not .
Up to A POINT WE worked together and built WE THIS SCHOOL IN IT here or THIS SCHOOL IN IT there .
Now THOSE AROUND MAXTON want to take WE school and put everybody in ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL . ''
THOSE AROUND MAXTON did n't feel like ROBESON COUNTY TRAINING SCHOOL was fair .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON question to THOSE AROUND MAXTON was , `` Well , it ca n't be integrated unless WE include everybody .
Why do A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW want to stick out there like A SORE THUMB ? If WE 're going to do A SORE THUMB WE need to all do A SORE THUMB . ''
But THOSE AROUND MAXTON thought A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE .
THOSE AROUND MAXTON did n't think THOSE AROUND MAXTON should .
THOSE AROUND MAXTON did n't think THOSE AROUND MAXTON should have to
A LOT OF RACISM
Was A LOT OF RACISM just racism , do YOU think , or was there something else behind A LOT OF RACISM ?
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON would n't say A LOT OF RACISM was A LOT OF RACISM .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON think A LOT OF RACISM was , `` A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're invading MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON territory . ''
Like with THE COLLEGE WHEN NORTH CAROLINA CAME IN AND SAYS , `` A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW 're going to be a part of THE SCHOOL SYSTEM so WE 're going to make A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW North Carolina College at PEMBROKE , '' NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT PEMBROKE .
`` THEY 're taking over WE schools , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do n't think THE COLLEGE WHEN NORTH CAROLINA CAME IN AND SAYS 's fair . ''
There was JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION .
And as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON say , JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION was n't to a point of really going at each other 's throat .
JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION was JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION .
How do A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW feel about JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION ? How do MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON feel about JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION .
Then A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW tell MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON how A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW feel , and MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON tell A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW how MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON feel .
JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION was JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION .
Well , JUST MOSTLY CONVERSATION 's interesting .
It seems like MALINDA MAYNOR notice a theme as MALINDA MAYNOR interview MOSTLY PEOPLE .
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER .
Maybe ONE WAY OR THE OTHER . 's because EACH OTHER had been really delayed here for such a long time .
Yeah .
MOSTLY PEOPLE kept trying not to make EACH OTHER AN ISSUE , and then finally , well , EACH OTHER 's got to be AN ISSUE , and there 's really nothing we can do about EACH OTHER .
But since everybody knew EACH OTHER was coming MOSTLY PEOPLE had conversations , and back and forth about how EACH OTHER was going to happen , or how is EACH OTHER best going to benefit MALINDA MAYNOR ? But then in THE INDIAN COMMUNITY , as YOU know , there was sort of a core group of people that did everything MOSTLY PEOPLE could to really stop THE INDIAN COMMUNITY .
Yeah .
But even then , MOSTLY PEOPLE could n't .
EACH OTHER could n't happen .
Was there A LOT of violence , racial violence in MAXTON CITY during THIS TIME PERIOD that YOU remember , either white/black , Indian/white , Indian/black ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE .
A LOT OF RACISM
MALINDA MAYNOR must ask because MALINDA MAYNOR read a newspaper article the other day about RED SPRINGS .
There was A FIGHT .
MALINDA MAYNOR think A FIGHT was 1969 or 68 maybe , a fight between black and white boys , and SOME WINDOW SMASHING , and THE DIFFERENT THINGS .
A FIGHT seemed pretty isolated .
Yeah .
There was n't a lot of fighting and tearing up THOSE THINGS .
THE MAJOR THING THAT HAPPENED IN MAXTON , they just burned 1970 down , and nobody ever figured out why . -LSB- laughter -RSB-
Well , right .
When YOU put THE MAJOR THING THAT HAPPENED IN MAXTON that way THE MAJOR THING THAT HAPPENED IN MAXTON 's like , `` WHAT ON EARTH ? '' But when MOSTLY PEOPLE passions are aroused , as YOU said , MOSTLY PEOPLE can do all kinds of CRAZY THINGS .
When A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW think about THE MAJOR THING THAT HAPPENED IN MAXTON , as MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON said before , NO THOUGHTS THAT THEY WERE MEMBERS OF KU KLUX KLAN was the child is sitting around listening to mom and dad talk about 1970 , that , blah , blah , blah , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know .
And WHAT ON EARTH may be all het up about THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING , that WHAT ON EARTH really do n't want THE INTEGRATION THAT HE TALKED ABOUT , IT HELPED THEM , TOO , AS WELL AS US , AND THAT 'S WHEN THE WHITE MAN STARTED PUTTING THE WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACKS AND THE INDIANS SAYING , and blah , blah , blah , so WHAT ON EARTH figures , `` Well , what the heck .
If WHAT ON EARTH 's how WHAT ON EARTH feel WE 'll just go burn down 1970 . ''
Maybe WHAT ON EARTH thoughts was , `` Then WHAT ON EARTH wo n't have PURNELL SWETT WHERE IT WAS to go . ''
Right .
`` If WHAT ON EARTH 're not happy where WHAT ON EARTH 're going , then WE 'll fix 1970 so WHAT ON EARTH wo n't have PURNELL SWETT WHERE IT WAS to go . ''
NO THOUGHTS THAT THEY WERE MEMBERS OF KU KLUX KLAN 's just NO THOUGHTS THAT THEY WERE MEMBERS OF KU KLUX KLAN , A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW know .
1970 backfired on WHAT ON EARTH .
Because THE OTHER KIDS usually get THE WRONG IDEA when YOUR PARENTS say a lot of CRAZY THINGS .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON feel like EVEN TODAY , EVEN TODAY , causes a lot of OUR YOUNG PEOPLE to still have prejudices because OUR YOUNG PEOPLE parents are prejudiced , and THAT , WHY IT GOT TO THAT LEVEL talk about THOSE THINGS before THESE INDIAN AND WHITE CHILDREN , and maybe THAT , WHY IT GOT TO THAT LEVEL do n't even mean EVEN TODAY in A FORMAL SENSE OF BEING ORGANIZED IN THAT WAY , OR WHAT KINDS OF THINGS WERE HAPPENING , but A CHILD sees EVEN TODAY in a different light .
Sure .
Or , THAT , WHY IT GOT TO THAT LEVEL could be just angry with A PERSON IN ANOTHER RACE FOR SOME OTHER REASON , but THAT , WHY IT GOT TO THAT LEVEL call THAT , WHY IT GOT TO THAT LEVEL out of HER NAME , and THE ONLY WHITE FAMILY WE HAD IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME right away says , `` Oh , A PERSON IN ANOTHER RACE FOR SOME OTHER REASON do n't like so-and-so .
THAT , WHY IT GOT TO THAT LEVEL 're against MY FATHER .
THAT , WHY IT GOT TO THAT LEVEL 're against MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON , '' and get THE WRONG IDEA .
So THE WRONG IDEA 's not always racism .
Sometimes THE WRONG IDEA 's just misunderstanding .
Yeah .
THE WRONG IDEA 's amazing how THE WRONG IDEA gets transferred from generation to generation .
THE WRONG IDEA 's true .
THE WRONG IDEA 's true .
Is there anything that MALINDA MAYNOR 've not asked YOU about that YOU feel like YOU want to say , or any particular thing that YOU feel like YOU helped accomplish during THIS TIME PERIOD that YOU want to talk about ?
A LOT OF THEM IN THE BACKGROUND THAT REALLY HELPED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS , LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON , AND WHO 'S DOING WHAT , AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING TO BE , AND WHAT TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THERE , MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON ca n't at this moment think of anything .
MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'll tell A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW what , if MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON do think of something else MISS WILLA ROBINSON AT THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION IN LUMBERTON 'll call A YOUNG LADY SO YOU DO N'T KNOW .
Please do .
This has been really - .
