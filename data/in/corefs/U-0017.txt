MY DADDY was quite interested in education .
MY DADDY used to run THE SCHOOL BOARD , and initiated building THE HIGH SCHOOL OUT HERE .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was in THE FIRST GRADUATING CLASS OUT THERE .
At ROSENWALD ?
Oh .
Remember `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' told A SENIOR `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' finished twice .
Right , right , right .
Okay .
THE FIRST TIME was THE FIRST TIME .
At THE FIRST TIME `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' knew HE had told US , well there was two of his children in THE FIRST GRADUATING CLASS OUT THERE , but HE told US that US were n't going to get any credit .
THAT , THAT 's simply THAT , THAT , THE HIGH SCHOOL OUT HERE did n't come up to par .
HE knew that .
THE HIGH SCHOOL OUT HERE was n't up to par .
But HE said , if `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' move A SENIOR all well , THE HIGH SCHOOL OUT HERE was THE HIGH SCHOOL OUT HERE .
THE HIGH SCHOOL OUT HERE would n't be finished .
And THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM moved out of there , THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM would n't stay .
There was just a few of US in there .
So US stayed .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' out HERE .
US had to come back , and had to go down here to THE FAIRMONT ROAD to ROSENWALD THE NEXT YEAR , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' think THE FAIRMONT ROAD was maybe THREE MONTHS , to get A CERTIFIED DIPLOMA .
US 's why `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' had to graduate twice .
Right .
Yes .
US 's amazing .
US 's what happened there .
Work-year student in 1940 .
A WORK-YEAR STUDENT , A SENIOR worked and went to school .
Okay .
We call them work-study students now .
A NEW NAME 's A NEW NAME now .
Occupational experience .
Do YOU want to include YOU army - -LSB- tape cuts off -RSB-
TAPE 10.21.03-AT is TAPE 10.21.03-AT .
THE INTERVIEWEE is `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' .
WE 're at THE INTERVIEWEE house in LUMBERTON , NORTH CAROLINA .
The interviewer is MALINDA MAYNOR .
So , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' , maybe YOU could start by telling WE about YOU father and telling WE about YOUR FATHER starting THE NAACP CHAPTER in ROBESON COUNTY , ROBESON COUNTY , what YOU were doing then , some of THE THINGS that were going on HERE .
Well , THE NAACP CHAPTER was initiated here in ROBESON COUNTY BY MY FATHER during THE FIRST TIME that `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was overseas .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was overseas from 1942 TO 1945 when `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' came home .
YOUR FATHER was very much interested in CIVIL RIGHTS AS WELL AS EDUCATION .
YOUR FATHER would step out in front as a leader in CIVIL RIGHTS AS WELL AS EDUCATION and when YOUR FATHER could even in education .
YOUR FATHER , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' do n't think YOUR FATHER even ever finished high school , but YOUR FATHER was very intellectual and was considered A LEADER in ROBESON COUNTY BY MY FATHER , church , and community activities .
What kind of work did YOUR FATHER do ?
BRICK MASON and farm .
Yes , after BRICK MASON quit the farm BRICK MASON became a brick mason and laid brick .
In fact , BRICK MASON learned to lay brick when BRICK MASON was BRICK MASON -LSB- actually , the school committee -RSB- out at Back Swamp and was building that school .
A GOOD FRIEND OF HIS named PROFESSOR ISLEY WHO WAS A REGULAR OLD BRICK MASON .
At THE FIRST TIME A GOOD FRIEND OF HIS learned to lay brick right out there .
BRICK MASON was also BRICK MASON , and THE SCHOOL BOARD 's why BRICK MASON had PROFESSOR ISLEY WHO WAS A REGULAR OLD BRICK MASON as a construction builder .
So before YOU went to THE WAR where were YOU attending school ?
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' attended school at Back Swamp .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' that A SENIOR might call high school class .
At THE FIRST TIME OUR classes , high school , was from eighth grade to eleventh .
OUR did n't have twelfth grade at THE FIRST TIME .
OUR was where `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was living , out there , and OUR 's where `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' finished .
Because of a lack of accreditation for THAT SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST YEAR-THE SCIENCE department was n't up .
The library department was n't up where OUR could get THE CREDIT FOR ALL OF THIS , so `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' had to spend THREE MONTHS at Rosenwald in THE FAIRMONT ROAD THE NEXT YEAR to get A CERTIFIED DIPLOMA .
YOU actual high school diploma .
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA .
So , now , after A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA . , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' finished school right here in 1937 .
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA . was at Back Swamp .
In 1938 `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' went back THREE MONTHS to ROSENWALD and got A CERTIFIED DIPLOMA .
After 1938 `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' worked in tobacco in 1939 , TOBACCO MARKETS , Durham , and on 1939 , TOBACCO MARKETS here .
In 1940 `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'd saved up enough money to enter Hampton Institute .
1940 's when `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' entered HAMPTON ON SEPTEMBER the 9th , 1940 .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was A WORK-YEAR STUDENT .
A WORK-YEAR STUDENT 's what we were called .
On THE SERVICE OCTOBER THE 16TH , 1940 , was when the call for all men the age of twenty-one to go to THEIR local board for registering for THE WAR .
THE SERVICE OCTOBER was in October of 1940 .
Nineteen hundred and forty-one , MY SECOND YEAR IN SCHOOL , then is when THEIR called `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' to go into THE SERVICE .
Of course , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' got A DEFERMENT twice .
THE THIRD TIME THEIR did n't grant `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' A DEFERMENT .
THEIR told `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' that `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'd have to report to THEIR LOCAL BOARD for service , which `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' did .
So in 1941 `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' left school in THE SERVICE OCTOBER , on October the THE 16TH , came home to THEIR LOCAL BOARD and was inducted into the service on November the 19th .
From that date `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was discharged from THE SERVICE OCTOBER , 1942 TO 1945 .
Okay .
And YOU returned home then ?
Returned home .
Went back to school at HAMPTON ON SEPTEMBER in THE TRADE SCHOOL .
When `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' FIRST went `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' went in the Ag department , but after `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' came back `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' went to THE TRADE SCHOOL and finished trade in tailoring , then came back home and worked for a few months with another tailor who was already set up here , THEN went into the tailor business for `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' right here on THE FAIRMONT ROAD .
FIRST 's what FIRST was then .
FIRST 's MARTIN LUTHER KING , JR. .
Drive .
Now did YOU get involved in THE NATIONAL NAACP when YOU came back and started working ?
Not immediately .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was a member , but so far as HOLDING OFFICE , NO .
After MY DADDY 'S PASSING `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' became president of THE NAACP CHAPTER for a couple of terms .
And when did MY DADDY 'S PASSING pass away ?
MY DADDY passed in 1973 .
Okay .
Nineteen seventy-three , April 25th .
Yes .
Really `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' mother was the ONE , which was his wife , trying to hold ONE up , to keep ONE going .
But one thing , after THE COUNTY CHAPTER was organized then all the municipalities here formed chapters : THE FAIRMONT ROAD , and Red Springs , St. Pauls , Maxton , and Rowland , and NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE .
All of them formed .
Okay .
And they formed after A SENIOR father formed THE COUNTY CHAPTER ?
Oh yes .
There was NO KIND OF CHAPTER here until daddy got a chapter formed in maybe 43 .
So we NO KIND OF CHAPTER went THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER with all these chapters operating here until maybe about THREE , or FOUR , or five years ago .
All the chapters were slowly not doing TOO MUCH , even ROBESON COUNTY , so the national offices advised all the chapters in ROBESON COUNTY to merge into one chapter .
And TOO MUCH was just here recently ?
Yes , TOO MUCH was just here recently , FOUR or five years ago .
So WE did WE , and THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER 's basically THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER , all merged into the ROBESON COUNTY chapter .
Okay .
And THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER 's THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER .
How effective was the NAACP did YOU think in THE 1940S and THE 1950S ? What kinds of THE THINGS was the organization doing ?
In THE 1950S ?
Yeah .
And THE 1940S ? THE NATIONAL NAACP at THE FIRST TIME did a lot of fighting for PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE and THE THINGS like THEY .
Now , THE NATIONAL NAACP became active in THE SCHOOL INTEGRATION during THE 1950S , but THE NATIONAL NAACP was working from THE NATIONAL LEVEL INSTEAD OF THIS COUNTY LEVEL at THE FIRST TIME .
WE even had Thurgood Marshall who was joint council for THE NATIONAL NAACP to come here and speak .
WE was in September in 1952 .
And why WE stands out , MY SECOND YEAR IN SCHOOL was MY SECOND YEAR IN SCHOOL -LSB- HURRICANE -RSB- HAZEL came through in SEPTEMBER , 1952 , and HURRICANE -RSB- HAZEL was delayed .
HURRICANE -RSB- HAZEL flight was delayed coming in so HURRICANE -RSB- HAZEL was late getting here that THAT NIGHT .
HURRICANE -RSB- HAZEL did come here and speak and everything .
At A WEEK THE NATIONAL NAACP on THE NATIONAL LEVEL INSTEAD OF THIS COUNTY LEVEL was fighting hard for integration and had THE SUIT .
It was already initiated to integrate THE SCHOOLS on the basis that separate but equal was unconstitutional .
In 54 , 54 's when THE NATIONAL NAACP was successful in getting THE U.S. SUPREME COURT to pass the law that separate but equal was unconstitutional .
What was YOU reaction to that ruling ?
Oh , well , WE were overjoyed .
Now , WE knew at THAT TIME IT WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS BECAUSE TRADITION IS NOT AN EASY THING FOR ANYONE TO GET OUT OF .
Naturally , WE knew that to integrate THE SCHOOLS was going to be tough and slow because WE knew that THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT were not ready for WE .
THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT was n't used to THAT TIME IT WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS BECAUSE TRADITION IS NOT AN EASY THING FOR ANYONE TO GET OUT OF .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' could understand that very well , but THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT did n't make THAT TIME IT WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS BECAUSE TRADITION IS NOT AN EASY THING FOR ANYONE TO GET OUT OF right , so WE kept fighting .
WE kept fighting .
What really set the ball to rolling was whenever THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ruled on Brown v. Topeka that separate but equal was unconstitutional and THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT and the president ordered to integrate THE SCHOOLS in ARKANSAS .
Now that started THE BALL ROLLING .
And , of course , out THERE , THE SAME AS IT IS HERE , THERE , THE SAME AS IT IS HERE resisted .
EVEN THE GOVERNORS was n't ready , and EVEN THE GOVERNORS represented THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM .
Naturally , EVEN THE GOVERNORS were going to try to satisfy THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM .
At EVEN THE GOVERNORS particular time-I never will forget THE SAME AS IT IS HERE .
THE FIRST ONE was THE FIRST ONE .
At THE FIRST TIME GOVERNOR FAUBUS was GOVERNOR FAUBUS .
GOVERNOR FAUBUS was GOVERNOR FAUBUS .
Of course all these SOUTHERN governors was against THE SCHOOL INTEGRATION , and they were just reluctant to do SOUTHERN .
THESE SOUTHERN GOVERNORS , THESE SOUTHERN GOVERNORS went against SOUTHERN .
THESE SOUTHERN GOVERNORS were slow .
THESE SOUTHERN GOVERNORS just would n't accept SOUTHERN .
What THESE SOUTHERN GOVERNORS did out here in ARKANSAS , Faubus-the justice department told THESE SOUTHERN GOVERNORS , `` Open THE DOOR and let THESE SOUTHERN GOVERNORS integrate THE SCHOOLS . ''
EVEN THE GOVERNORS took the initiative to place EVEN THE GOVERNORS state national guards in THE SCHOOL DOOR to keep THEIR STATE NATIONAL GUARDS from going there , keep BLACKS from going there even after BLACKS had been ordered to do so .
EVEN THE GOVERNORS was very easy because after GOVERNOR FAUBUS put THEIR STATE NATIONAL GUARDS there to keep THEIR STATE NATIONAL GUARDS out , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' know this because GENERAL EISENHOWER-HE was GENERAL EISENHOWER-HE .
GOVERNOR FAUBUS was GOVERNOR FAUBUS .
But GENERAL EISENHOWER-HE was GENERAL EISENHOWER-HE .
GENERAL EISENHOWER-HE took THE SAME GUARDS out there in ARKANSAS and federalized THE SAME GUARDS .
GENERAL EISENHOWER-HE said , `` A SENIOR 'll all have to move . ''
Federalized THE SAME GUARDS THERE AT THAT SCHOOL .
THE SAME GUARDS was already placed there by THE STATE to keep BLACKS out .
THERE AT THAT SCHOOL federalized THE SAME GUARDS .
THE SAME GUARDS 's what happened .
Was that happening here in LUMBERTON , NORTH CAROLINA ?
Oh , HOLDING OFFICE , NO .
Not at THE FIRST TIME .
What was happening here ?
Well , THE FIRST THING AFTER THAT , THAT was national .
THE FIRST THING AFTER THAT , THAT was for nationally .
If THE FIRST THING AFTER THAT , THAT was for ARKANSAS , THE FIRST THING AFTER THAT , THAT was THE FIRST THING AFTER THAT , THAT .
THAT , THAT passed an order to start desegregating THE SCHOOLS .
THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT told THAT , THAT to do THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'm trying to think of THE WORD that THAT , THAT used , but slowly do THE WORD .
THE WORD was what THAT , THAT was telling THAT , THAT to do .
But , as `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , all of them bucked up .
After THAT , THAT were moving slow , THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT turned around and kind of give THAT , THAT a time to speed up THE SCHOOL INTEGRATION .
Of course , then THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT was just that THE SCHOOLS had to be integrated , but every school system in THE SOUTH .
The boards were trying THEIR BEST , and THE STATE , even OUR state legislature , what THAT , THAT did , THAT , THAT drew up THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE .
THAT , THAT had been ordered to do THEIR BEST , how THAT , THAT were going to integrate .
And OUR plan , THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE , was named THE PEARSALL PLAN .
Pearsall was a legislator up there .
Now , THE PEARSALL PLAN places in THE PEARSALL PLAN to still keep THAT , THAT schools integrated .
THAT , THAT started building THEIR SCHOOLS INTEGRATED for BLACKS after BLACKS had been ordered , to build schools in the black communities and white schools in the white communities .
After THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT got onto that THAT , THAT told THAT , THAT THAT , THAT said , `` A SENIOR have to bus THAT , THAT .
A SENIOR have to bus THAT , THAT .
SCHOOL IN THE BLACK AND
-LSB- unclear -RSB- go to SCHOOL IN THE BLACK AND , SCHOOL IN THE BLACK AND 's black .
SCHOOL IN THE WHITE , go to SCHOOL IN THE WHITE , SCHOOL IN THE WHITE 's white .
THEY started busing , and that busing was very effective even right here in NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE .
THEY asked for A BOND ISSUE to build THE TWO SCHOOLS , a high school over here in THE SOUTH , THE SOUTH , which was predominantly black , and A HIGH SCHOOL over in NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE .
Now for THE TWO SCHOOLS A MILLION was A MILLION and a half dollars , one and a half million dollars , and THE TWO SCHOOLS was stated the half A MILLION to build the school in THE SOUTH and A MILLION to build the one in NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE .
Well , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was fighting that `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' just hook , line , and sinker .
So THE EARLY 1960S , RIGHT , THE BOND ISSUE was THE EARLY 1960S , RIGHT , THE BOND ISSUE ?
Yes , ma'am .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was fighting THE EARLY 1960S , RIGHT , THE BOND ISSUE hook , line , and sinker because at THE FIRST TIME `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' had MY OLDEST CHILD , Mishelle , MY OLDEST CHILD was FOUR YEARS ahead of our SECOND child -LSB- unclear -RSB- child , academically .
MY OLDEST CHILD was FOUR YEARS ahead of MY OLDEST CHILD , MISHELLE .
After A MILLION passed at THE SECOND COUNT , THE SECOND COUNT fell through THE FIRST TIME but THE SECOND COUNT passed THE SECOND COUNT , THEY built THE TWO SCHOOLS here .
THEY build TWO , ONE IN SOUTH LUMBERTON , one in NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE .
After THEY did THEY , and THEY was taken to THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT , THEY found THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT out , THEY ordered THIS SCHOOL SYSTEM , `` A SENIOR wo n't have LUMBERTON HIGH SCHOOL . ''
So MY DAUGHTER was a member of TODAY , A JUNIOR HIGH .
HERE had to shut TODAY , A JUNIOR HIGH down and use TODAY , A JUNIOR HIGH for A JUNIOR HIGH .
HERE 's what TODAY , A JUNIOR HIGH is TODAY , A JUNIOR HIGH .
TODAY , A JUNIOR HIGH was the only junior high in THE CITY ? , and the white one became the only senior high school in THE CITY ? .
So regardless of what color A SENIOR were , if A SENIOR were A SENIOR A SENIOR had to go to the same school .
A SENIOR had to go to THE SAME JUNIOR high .
How successful did YOU feel like THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT solution was ?
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 'S SOLUTION was just what WE needed .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'll tell A SENIOR what , if THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 'S SOLUTION had n't happened today WE 'd be right at the brink of where WE were when WE was freed from slavery .
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 'S SOLUTION started , not only in THEIR SCHOOLS INTEGRATED , THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 'S SOLUTION started integration at the lunch counters , integration of the buses , integration of motels , and all of these establishments .
THEY were fighting THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 'S SOLUTION , but THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT was pushing THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT .
THEY was all over THE SOUTH .
And today , today THE SOUTH caused one race to realize that there 're SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES .
THE SOUTH caused SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES to realize that BLACKS AS WELL AS WHITES have to have an opportunity to advance , progress just as BLACKS AS WELL AS WHITES have .
Through THE GENERATIONS THE SOUTH has caused even this younger generation to become less - well , basically THE GENERATIONS 're color blind now .
THE WHITE CHILDREN OF TODAY AND THE BLACK CHILDREN OR ANY MINORITIES , INDIANS AND ALL , THE WHITE CHILDREN OF TODAY AND THE BLACK CHILDREN OR ANY MINORITIES , INDIANS AND ALL .
Naturally now `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' must say THIS , there 's discrimination and segregation amongst THESE RACES THEMSELVES to A CERTAIN DEGREE .
A SENIOR 're going to find that , but today THESE RACES THEMSELVES intermingle , THIS co-mingle .
What has brought A CERTAIN DEGREE about is just A CERTAIN DEGREE .
A CERTAIN DEGREE 's true right now that WE have a lot of THE WHITES .
WE also have a lot of BLACKS .
But still , WE got SOME BLACKS , of COURSE MOST OF THEM ARE BY GONE BY NOW , SOME BLACKS do n't like mixing THESE RACES THEMSELVES .
And THE WHITES , THE WHITES do n't like COURSE MOST OF THEM ARE BY GONE BY NOW .
But WE 're at A PLACE WHERE WE CA N'T HELP OURSELVES BECAUSE AFTER OUR CHILDREN REACH A CERTAIN AGE NOW , WE LOSE CONTROL OVER THEM .
THE WHITE CHILDREN OF TODAY AND THE BLACK CHILDREN OR ANY MINORITIES , INDIANS AND ALL go for THE WHITE CHILDREN OF TODAY AND THE BLACK CHILDREN OR ANY MINORITIES , INDIANS AND ALL , and A PLACE WHERE WE CA N'T HELP OURSELVES BECAUSE AFTER OUR CHILDREN REACH A CERTAIN AGE NOW , WE LOSE CONTROL OVER THEM 's A PLACE WHERE WE CA N'T HELP OURSELVES BECAUSE AFTER OUR CHILDREN REACH A CERTAIN AGE NOW , WE LOSE CONTROL OVER THEM .
A SENIOR ca n't wait until THE WHITE CHILDREN OF TODAY AND THE BLACK CHILDREN OR ANY MINORITIES , INDIANS AND ALL 're FORTY or fifty years and then turn THE WHITE CHILDREN OF TODAY AND THE BLACK CHILDREN OR ANY MINORITIES , INDIANS AND ALL loose .
FORTY 's just been FORTY .
A SENIOR know , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 've seen THE THINGS take place that if THE WHITE CHILDREN OF TODAY AND THE BLACK CHILDREN OR ANY MINORITIES , INDIANS AND ALL 'd been during THE FIRST TIME `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'd of been hanging in A TREE .
Hanging in A TREE .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 've seen A TIME in this area A SMART BLACK MAN could n't show A TIME but so much .
A SMART BLACK MAN just had to shut up .
If A SENIOR did , they 'd call A SENIOR smart , and maybe flog A SENIOR to death .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' give GOD THE CREDIT FOR ALL OF THIS , but THE CREDIT FOR ALL OF THIS just brought THESE RACES THEMSELVES closer together .
What did YOU think about what Indians were doing at THAT TIME IN THE LATE 50S AND EARLY 60S , say the KKK thing , how did YOU react to that ?
Oh , THAT TIME IN THE LATE 50S AND EARLY 60S was marvelous .
THAT TIME IN THE LATE 50S AND EARLY 60S was marvelous .
Now , at one time , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' want to say THIS ABOUT THE INDIANS .
The black population was heavier than THE INDIAN POPULATION .
Most THE INDIANS .
THIS ABOUT THE INDIANS live everywhere , but THEY NEST was in the Pembroke area .
Of course , THE WHITES was against THE WHITES just like THE WHITES were against BLACKS , but THE WHITES accepted THE INDIANS , as `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' saw THE INDIANS , a degree above BLACKS .
THE INDIANS was like THIS , WHERE WE USED TO PARTNER WITH THE INDIANS , `` Well , if we 're going to have to have one to mingle with , '' THIS , WHERE WE USED TO PARTNER WITH THE INDIANS would prefer THE INDIANS .
A SENIOR may see a little of THE INDIANS now .
LIFE is just real .
LIFE 's just LIFE .
Again , WE all had a lot of prejudice .
The black race was filled with prejudice , too .
WE 've got WE .
WE 's human nature .
But , yet , if WE 're going to call WE Christians and things WE must struggle to get beyond some of THAT STUFF .
In order for WE to be successful and have a successful society WE must work together .
Did YOU feel that there were THE INDIANS ?
To start with BLACKS AT THAT TIME partnered with BLACKS .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' can remember clearly that 's THE WAY WE HAD TO VOTE .
BLACKS and THE INDIANS was getting together when THE INDIANS came to ELECTIONS to vote .
WE have A LITTLE OF THAT NOW , but THE GREATEST POPULATION is THE GREATEST POPULATION out of the THREE races now .
BLACKS 're much more independent now than BLACKS were back then .
Was A LITTLE OF THAT NOW more equal back THEN , THE GREATEST POPULATION , or who was dominating ?
THE WHITE were dominating , and THE GREATEST POPULATION was greater than THE INDIAN POPULATION , but now THE INDIAN POPULATION is greater than BLACK or THE WHITE .
Of course , back in THE FIRST TIME `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' could see that coming , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' give OH LORD THE CREDIT FOR ALL OF THIS because `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' even spoke to one of the Indian leaders that lived not far here from `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' .
When THEN , THE POPULATION , OR WHO WAS DOMINATING was getting ready for ELECTIONS , OH LORD came over HERE and sat down on the porch and THEN , THE POPULATION , OR WHO WAS DOMINATING talked .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Well , WORTH , '' WORTH was WORTH .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Now , WORTH 's true that THEN , THE POPULATION , OR WHO WAS DOMINATING 've got to work together to have any say-so in this county with THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Because THEN , THE POPULATION , OR WHO WAS DOMINATING 're out numbered . ''
THEN , THE POPULATION , OR WHO WAS DOMINATING all knew THEN , THE POPULATION , OR WHO WAS DOMINATING .
THEN , THE POPULATION , OR WHO WAS DOMINATING knew that .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` But A SENIOR know YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT , '' `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' told HIM , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Now YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT looks to `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' like THE INDIAN POPULATION was just beginning to grow . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT looks to `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' like in FIVE or ten years THE INDIAN RACE looks like THE INDIAN RACE 's fixing to double THE INDIAN POPULATION . ''
And HIM admitted YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT .
HIM said , `` Since A SENIOR said that , YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT 's what we plan to do . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` A SENIOR 're planning to take ROBESON COUNTY back over . ''
Jokingly `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said that , but `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' knew that THE INDIANS felt like the land had been taken from THEM , and if `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'd been in THEM shoes if there was any way to take THE INDIANS back , take THE INDIANS back .
But `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'm caught in the middle .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'm caught in the middle right here .
Right , absolutely .
Being A BLACK MAN .
How did that change or shape YOU strategy for dealing with the problem ?
Well , to tell A SENIOR THE TRUTH THE TRUTH did n't .
THE TRUTH has changed THE TRUTH .
Right now `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' can tell A SENIOR THIS , where WE used to partner with THE INDIANS there are some cases now that WE might even partner with THE WHITES , but back then WE could n't partner with THE WHITES .
THIS did n't want WE .
THE WAY WE HAD TO VOTE
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' can remember very clearly THE FIRST TIME A WHITE EVER CAME TO ME .
THE FIRST TIME A WHITE EVER CAME TO ME was a white running for COUNTY COMMISSIONERS .
THIS COMMISSIONER came to `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' asking `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' about how `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' felt about a run off .
And `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' told THIS COMMISSIONER , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Well , A SENIOR know THE FIRST TIME A WHITE EVER CAME TO ME 's something to know that A SENIOR 've come to `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Never before have the white folks eyes been open enough to see that COUNTY COMMISSIONERS might need black support . ''
WE were open to COUNTY COMMISSIONERS then , but COUNTY COMMISSIONERS did n't care nothing about WE vote .
But anyway `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' told THIS COMMISSIONER , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' just had a thought . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' asked THIS COMMISSIONER what THE COMMISSION was doing , asking me-I did n't put THE COMMISSION THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER , but `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' knew what COUNTY COMMISSIONERS was asking me-did `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' think `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' could help COUNTY COMMISSIONERS get enough support to get in ?
In THE RUN OFF .
Yeah .
From BLACKS .
And `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' just flat told HIM , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' do n't know .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' had n't even thought of it . ''
But `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' did tell HIM , `` SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IN YEARS PAST is SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IN YEARS PAST . ''
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IN YEARS PAST 's made RACISTS see RACISTS .
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IN YEARS PAST 's made RACISTS see RACISTS .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' really think , well , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' hate to say SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IN YEARS PAST like SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IN YEARS PAST because in every race WE 've got some who WE call WE followers of CHRIST .
Always WE follow CHRIST .
WE know CHRIST word , but yet WE fail to do THE WORD .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' think THE WORD 's caused all of us to look at WE Christian life .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' know that THE WORD has been flawed beyond measure .
There 's still flaws in THEM .
There 's still some flaws in THEM .
Maybe THEM could talk a little bit then about after THEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT came in and said there had to be only one high school , the City of NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE tried another tactic .
Oh , yes .
Right , to keep THE SCHOOLS SEGREGATED .
Let THE SCHOOLS SEGREGATED talk about THE SCHOOLS SEGREGATED .
Now , after THE CITY ? built THE TWO SCHOOLS , TWO , ONE IN SOUTH LUMBERTON black high schools and had to shut THEM down .
Then the City of NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE next tactic was THEM 'd keep THEM from heavily mixing .
BLACKS had never , never in BLACKS life , paid one cent to come to THE CITY ? THESE TWO SCHOOLS , TWO BLACK HIGH SCHOOLS and never been asked to if A SENIOR lived out in ROBESON COUNTY BY MY FATHER .
THE WHITES had always paid , if A SENIOR lived in ROBESON COUNTY BY MY FATHER to come to THE CITY SCHOOLS .
But after it was forced to integrate THE HIGH SCHOOL OUT HERE , THE CITY ? used the tactics , `` WE 're going to charge BLACK now if THE WHITES do n't live in THE CITY ? .
WE 're going to charge THE WHITES to come to school .
Thirty-five dollars A HEAD .
WE 're going to charge THE WHITES . ''
THE WHITES knew THE WHITES would eliminate a whole lot of BLACKS because THE WHITES did n't have the money .
And THE WHITES were right .
THE WHITES were exactly right .
So THE WHITES put THAT FEE on .
THE WHITES had THAT RIGHT NOW .
THE WHITES had been charging THE WHITE , but we knew the reason THE WHITES were doing THAT RIGHT NOW , to keep A SENIOR out .
There were SOME PARENTS , black parents had FIVE , SIX , SEVEN , SEVEN , EIGHT , nine children in school , and SOME PARENTS could n't pay thirty-five dollars A HEAD .
The majority of the blacks over in the THE SOUTH area , THE CITY LIMITS AT THAT TIME started up at MCMILLAN 'S FUNERAL HOME .
Well , THE CITY SCHOOL BOARD had already bought property out HERE where THE SAME JUNIOR high is now , and had THE CITY SCHOOL BOARD to extend THE CITY ? limits out there so HERE could build a school and have the property .
OUR city council did OUR .
HERE actually did HERE , but HERE did n't include anything but just THE HIGHWAY .
The residential and east side between MCMILLAN 'S FUNERAL HOME and THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL was in ROBESON COUNTY BY MY FATHER .
Nothing but THE HIGHWAY -LSB- unclear -RSB- road .
And who lived in those houses ?
Blacks .
Nothing but blacks on both sides .
It 's still THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER .
So SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES came .
SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES could n't pay thirty-five dollars A HEAD .
SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES came to `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' and asked `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' what SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES could do .
Well , at THE FIRST TIME MY DAUGHTER had finished high school .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' just had A SON , and A SON was just entering high school .
Some of SOME PARENTS had FIVE , SIX , SEVEN , SEVEN , FIVE , SIX , SEVEN , EIGHT , NINE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' response was well , `` There 's only one way in THE WORLD that WE might be able to get in HERE , and HERE is through legal counsel .
WE can not use any counsel here NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE , '' because NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE was nothing but white .
So YOU could n't hire any lawyers because WE were all white ?
A SENIOR could hire HERE , but NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE would n't make A DIFFERENCE .
HERE asked `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' if `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' knew anybody that might help .
Now go ahead for US .
JULIUS CHAMBERS .
JULIUS CHAMBERS . had just sued UNC so JULIUS CHAMBERS . could go to school there .
So `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' contacted JULIUS CHAMBERS . , and JULIUS CHAMBERS . agreed to come and look US situation over and help US .
So US were meeting at MCMILLAN 'S FUNERAL HOME .
JULIUS CHAMBERS . came down twice to talk to US and look OUR SITUATION over .
THE SECOND TIME HE LEFT AND WENT BACK HE called `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' .
JULIUS CHAMBERS . said , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 've been in communication with A SENIOR black city councilman .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 've been in communication with A SENIOR school board superintendent , DR. CARROLL . ''
Is THE SECOND TIME HE LEFT AND WENT BACK HE Gale , G-A-L-E ?
DR. CARROLL
MALINDA MAYNOR 'm sorry , okay .
DR. CARROLL said , `` NEITHER ONE OF THEM want to compromise .
In fact , DR. CARROLL told `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' that DR. CARROLL was n't interested in meeting with OUR GROUP OVER THERE .
Nothing DR. CARROLL can do for them . ''
DR. CARROLL said , `` YOUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN said there were TWO , ONE IN SOUTH LUMBERTON different bodies .
THE SCHOOL BOARD was independent .
THE CITY COUNCIL , SAME BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN was independent of THE SCHOOL BOARD . ''
DR. CARROLL said , `` Well , THEY ought to know that `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' know better than THEY .
All city councils work together with the school board on certain issues . ''
DR. CARROLL said , `` In THE FIRST PLACE THE SCHOOL BOARD did n't zigzag that line out there like THE FIRST PLACE did to build that school . ''
DR. CARROLL said , `` THE CITY COUNCIL , SAME BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN had to put THE CITY COUNCIL , SAME BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN out there .
They did THE CITY COUNCIL , SAME BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN for THE SCHOOL BOARD . ''
DR. CARROLL said , `` YOUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN insulted `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' intelligence . ''
DR. CARROLL said , `` DR. CARROLL really made `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' hot , so `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'm going to tell A SENIOR what A SENIOR do . ''
DR. CARROLL said , `` A SENIOR get A SENIOR group together down there . ''
DR. CARROLL said , `` When THEY did that THEY broke a statute of THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE . ''
DR. CARROLL told `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' what that statute was .
At THE FIRST TIME if A SENIOR extend the city limit A SENIOR had to take into consideration all THE -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- OF THE RESIDENTS , and THE RESIDENTS did not , not one .
DR. CARROLL said , `` We 've got to put heat to the seat , sue THE SCHOOL BOARD and THE CITY COUNCIL , SAME BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN . ''
So DR. CARROLL came down THE THIRD TIME .
DR. CARROLL said , `` Be ready to show `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' what A SENIOR want in THE SCHOOL DISTRICT . ''
THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THE CITY COUNCIL 's THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THE CITY COUNCIL .
So DR. CARROLL came down THE THIRD TIME .
When DR. CARROLL was getting ready to go , as `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 've said WE always met at MCMILLAN 'S FUNERAL HOME , WE black city councilman was in the rear .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' did n't know DR. CARROLL was in there , but when DR. CARROLL heard JULIUS CHAMBERS . make JULIUS CHAMBERS . plan of what JULIUS CHAMBERS . was going to do , DR. CARROLL immediately jumped up and said , `` No , do n't sue .
WE can help A SENIOR .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' can help A SENIOR . ''
YOUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN jumped up and said that ?
Yes .
So `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' did n't know A SENIOR was back there .
A SENIOR could have been helping US A long time ago and saved US A A LITTLE MONEY TO PUT IN OUR POCKETS . ''
JULIUS CHAMBERS . said , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' , A LITTLE MONEY TO PUT IN OUR POCKETS 's whatever A SENIOR all want to do . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` US A 're ready to go and show A SENIOR where A SENIOR 're wrong . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` YOUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN did n't ask for to go along with US A . ''
And JULIUS CHAMBERS . asked `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' , and `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Sure A LITTLE MONEY TO PUT IN OUR POCKETS 's all right .
All US A want is JULIUS CHAMBERS . to go along . ''
So JULIUS CHAMBERS . did , JULIUS CHAMBERS . came right along with US A and joked the whole while US A was out there .
So after US A began to show JULIUS CHAMBERS . what US A was going to do , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' never will forget , US A got down to MCCOLLUM STREET , and when US A got to MCCOLLUM STREET the next street over was STARLITE DRIVE , '' WHICH I HAD N'T .
US A 's where THE INDIANS lived on STARLITE DRIVE , '' WHICH I HAD N'T .
Nothing but blacks living on MCCOLLUM STREET .
So `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' suggested , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Let 'S go down half way between STARLITE DRIVE , '' WHICH I HAD N'T and MCCOLLUM STREET out to THE FAIRMONT ROAD . ''
'S 's what 'S was at THE FIRST TIME .
'S 's MARTIN LUTHER KING , JR. now .
This councilman says , `` No , lets go to STARLITE DRIVE , '' WHICH I HAD N'T . ''
At THE FIRST TIME `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Look , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' have not talked to SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES on STARLITE DRIVE , '' WHICH I HAD N'T .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' do n't even know what SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES want . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES 're Indians . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' have n't talked with SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES .
SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES might throw A MONKEY WRENCH in A MONKEY WRENCH . ''
JULIUS CHAMBERS . said , `` SMART PEOPLE IN ALL RACES 's all right .
Whatever A SENIOR want . ''
So WE came on with THE LINE COMING HALF WAY BETWEEN THE TWO STREETS and got to THE FAIRMONT ROAD , and then WE had make a decision , `` Where are WE going now ? '' This councilman said , `` Well now , WE 'll just go straight on across here to Allen Street . ''
THE LINE COMING HALF WAY BETWEEN THE TWO STREETS 's THE LINE COMING HALF WAY BETWEEN THE TWO STREETS .
Well , now `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'm living , MY RESIDENCE is sitting now on the other side of STARLITE DRIVE , '' WHICH I HAD N'T right here where MY RESIDENCE is now .
A SON , A SON 's in school , and `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' want A SON in school .
YOUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN said , `` Why do n't A SENIOR pay the thirty-five dollars ? '' `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` Yes , sir .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' could pay A SENIOR thirty-five dollars to get A SON in school , but when WE get through drawing THE LINE COMING HALF WAY BETWEEN THE TWO STREETS `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' can just see THE CITY COUNCIL , SAME BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN and THE SCHOOL BOARD ai n't going to let nobody just beyond THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT LINE COME IN THERE . ''
JULIUS CHAMBERS . said , `` A SENIOR 're right . ''
JULIUS CHAMBERS . said , `` What do A SENIOR want `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' to do ? '' So `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' just suggested , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` In ORDER THAT MY SON MAY CONTINUE GO RIGHT DOWN THE HIGHWAY SOUTH , DOWN TO THE SOUTH LINE , include MY RESIDENCE and then come back up , then WE 'll go across THE OTHER STREETS . ''
JULIUS CHAMBERS . drew ORDER THAT MY SON MAY CONTINUE GO RIGHT DOWN THE HIGHWAY SOUTH , DOWN TO THE SOUTH LINE on a piece of paper and wrote in there to include `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' residence .
ORDER THAT MY SON MAY CONTINUE GO RIGHT DOWN THE HIGHWAY SOUTH , DOWN TO THE SOUTH LINE 's in THERE THAT WAY by name now if THERE THAT WAY did n't throw ORDER THAT MY SON MAY CONTINUE GO RIGHT DOWN THE HIGHWAY SOUTH , DOWN TO THE SOUTH LINE away .
Then WE came on back to MCMILLAN 'S FUNERAL HOME .
YOUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN said , `` Now , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' could take THIS and get THIS through for A SENIOR all . ''
And JULIUS CHAMBERS . said , `` What do A SENIOR want to about THIS , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` JULIUS CHAMBERS . can do anything .
THIS do n't make A DIFFERENCE as long as THIS 's done . ''
We just handed THIS over to JULIUS CHAMBERS . .
JULIUS CHAMBERS . took THIS and went to THE SCHOOL BOARD , and THIS was okayed .
It was okayed just as beautiful as ever .
-LSB- Laughter . -RSB-
THEY 're like , `` SURE . ''
Yeah .
Yeah .
THEY could have done `` SURE all the time .
Then THEY began to have problems .
THE WHITES began to have a problem .
Right here CLYBURNE PINES , Barker Ten Mile , all of those schools .
THE WHITES were out of THE CITY LIMITS AT THAT TIME in THE SCHOOL DISTRICT , so THE WHITES started crying about how could THE WHITES get THE WHITES children in THE CITY LIMITS AT THAT TIME ? And DR. CARROLL told THE WHITES , `` Do like THE SOUTH .
Get A SENIOR petition together to get THE WHITES in . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' listened to YOUR PETITION , and `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` FIVE , SIX , SEVEN , EIGHT , NINE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL would n't tell us nothing , but FIVE , SIX , SEVEN , EIGHT , NINE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL 's telling THE WHITES now how to get in . ''
Now is that DR. CARROLL ?
Yeah , YOUR PETITION was DR. CARROLL .
YOU were telling MALINDA MAYNOR last time about a meeting that YOU were at CARROLL MIDDLE SCHOOL , is this that same time period ?
Yeah , THE SAME THING is THE SAME THING .
Late 1970s ?
Yes .
Now , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' had a cousin .
ME , `` ANGUS was teaching over to CARROLL MIDDLE SCHOOL .
ME , `` ANGUS came in one evening , and called ME , `` ANGUS , '' ME , `` ANGUS said , `` they had a meeting over HERE at CLYBURNE PINES .
THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT had a meeting in THE HIGH SCHOOL OUT HERE .
THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT 're wanting to get THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT children in the city school . ''
LAWYER LEE , LAWYER LEE was THE SCHOOL BOARD , and LAWYER LEE agreed .
LAWYER LEE , really , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' do n't even think LAWYER LEE knew what was going on .
Lloyd Lee ?
Lawyer .
THE SPEAKER
Okay .
THE SPEAKER was THE SPEAKER , and THE SPEAKER was telling all these people how hard THE SCHOOL BOARD had worked to get THE SOUTH in .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` THE SPEAKER did n't know no better . ''
SHE said , `` But THEY 'll have ANOTHER MEETING , and this time for THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL . ''
SHE said , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' 'll let A SENIOR know when THEY 're going to have ANOTHER MEETING . ''
So THEY did .
THEY had ANOTHER MEETING .
ME AND MY WIFE , ANGUS was just out of 1977 , HE was with us , but HE wo n't say nothing now .
At ANOTHER MEETING ME AND MY WIFE , ANGUS were crying about what ME AND MY WIFE , ANGUS could do to get ME AND MY WIFE , ANGUS children in THE CITY SCHOOLS .
It was announced , `` Anybody that had anything to say , '' and that auditorium filled up , `` feel free . ''
All A SENIOR had to do was go up to THE PODIUM , ALL THE WAY DOWN and tell ME AND MY WIFE , ANGUS .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' did n't even move until everybody finished .
It was n't nothing but THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT .
LAWYER LEE had told THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT how hard THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT worked to get THE SOUTH in and all THAT KIND OF STUFF .
Now at THE FIRST TIME MY PASTOR HAPPENED-HE was on THE SCHOOL BOARD .
MY PASTOR HAPPENED-HE was sitting on THE STAGE .
All the school board was sitting on THE STAGE .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' pastor was on there .
So , after THEY all finished `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' got up and went down to THE PODIUM , ALL THE WAY DOWN .
Told THEY who `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' was , `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' want to set the record straight .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' want to know how THE SOUTH got into THE SCHOOL DISTRICT . ''
And `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' told THEY what WE had went through , that WE had gotten JULIUS CHAMBERS . out of CHARLOTTE , and JULIUS CHAMBERS . threatened to sue .
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` After WE showed JULIUS CHAMBERS . what WE wanted in THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT LINE COME IN THERE and JULIUS CHAMBERS . drew THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT LINE COME IN THERE up , '' `` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` WE black city councilman was with WE .
JULIUS CHAMBERS . told WE that JULIUS CHAMBERS . could get THE SAME THING agreed to and incorporated . ''
`` ANGUS -LSB- THOMPSON . -RSB- '' said , `` So , WE let JULIUS CHAMBERS . do THE SAME THING .
WE 's how WE got in HERE , not through HERE working for WE .
THE SAME THING was through a fight . ''
And A SENIOR could hear a rat jump on THE -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- OF THE RESIDENTS .
And when WE came out - MRS. THOMPSON , what was the name of THAT WOMAN 'S ORGANIZATION ?
MRS. THOMPSON do n't remember .
Boy , they come at MRS. THOMPSON .
MRS. THOMPSON knew THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT did n't know what was going on .
So MRS. THOMPSON told THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT , MRS. THOMPSON said , `` Yeah , THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT 's how WE got in HERE . ''
And MRS. THOMPSON showed THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT how FIVE , SIX , SEVEN , EIGHT , NINE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL were growing up being misled .
LILLIAN , WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT WOMAN 'S ORGANIZATION : And paid a lawyer to come in .
Yeah , WE had to fight to get in there .
WE had to -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
Yes , LORDY .
LORDY 's how WE got in HERE .
Anyway , GENERAL EISENHOWER-HE , GENERAL EISENHOWER-HE came to MRS. THOMPSON THAT NIGHT .
SHE left here .
HERE got on SHE so bad that SHE left THE FIRST PLACE .
MRS. THOMPSON do n't even know what happened to THAT WOMAN 'S ORGANIZATION because SHE was getting a write up in THE PAPER and all that stuff .
But even at THAT WOMAN 'S ORGANIZATION , later on when THAT WOMAN 'S ORGANIZATION came out in THE PAPER , THAT WOMAN 'S ORGANIZATION came out through the news media that OUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN fought for us to get in THE SCHOOL DISTRICT .
OUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN did n't do nothing to keep THE SUIT -LSB- unclear -RSB- , but draw THE SUIT up .
But , MRS. THOMPSON can understand THE THINGS .
THEY did n't know .
THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER said , `` MRS. THOMPSON , MRS. THOMPSON did n't know all of that . ''
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` MRS. THOMPSON know A SENIOR did n't , and A SENIOR did n't try to find out either . ''
THEY 's just what MRS. THOMPSON told THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER .
THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER did n't know it , but THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER was with THEY .
THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER was THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER .
THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER was white .
THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER could have found out , but there was nobody caring about US .
How did YOU get the money to pay JULIUS CHAMBERS . ?
OUT OF OUR POCKETS .
How did YOU raise OUT OF OUR POCKETS . ?
OUT OF OUR POCKETS .
In fact , MRS. THOMPSON told them .
At THE FIRST TIME MRS. THOMPSON knew all US needed to do is take care of HIS expenses from CHARLOTTE .
HIS was n't coming to be charging US .
MRS. THOMPSON think THE FIRST TIME HE CAME DOWN IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS .
THE FIRST TIME HE CAME DOWN IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS was all US gave HIS .
Thirty-five dollars , THE FIRST TIME HE CAME DOWN IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS was big money then .
-LSB- Laughter . -RSB-
But HIS loved THE FIRST TIME HE CAME DOWN IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS .
THE FIRST TIME HE CAME DOWN IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS was THE FIRST TIME HE CAME DOWN IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS .
THE NATIONAL NAACP was paying HIS .
Of course THE NATIONAL NAACP has never been a money maker .
A SENIOR do n't make nothing too much .
THE NATIONAL NAACP 's like A SON .
As soon as A SON came out they took A SON there and A SON was made state THE NATIONAL NAACP lawyer .
All that stuff worked well .
Were there MEMBERS of THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO WERE NOT PART OF THE NAACP and who resisted what YOU were doing , or disagreed with THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO WERE NOT PART OF THE NAACP ?
Well , at THE FIRST TIME A SENIOR know MRS. THOMPSON hate to tell A SENIOR , but at THE FIRST TIME most of THE BLACKS-THE WHITES had picked out a leader for THE BLACKS-THE WHITES .
THE WHITE PEOPLE had picked out a black leader for THE BLACKS-THE WHITES .
When MRS. THOMPSON say THE WHITE , even if MEMBERS elected THE WHITE PEOPLE , especially at THE FIRST TIME , BLACKS were not thinking for THE WHITE PEOPLE like THE WHITE PEOPLE think now .
THE STATUS QUO was THE STATUS QUO .
If A SENIOR had some education or not , THE WHITE PEOPLE were looking for somebody to follow .
Not thinking for THE WHITE PEOPLE , what did THE WHITE PEOPLE know about laws and all that stuff ? None of THE WHITE PEOPLE had been exposed to THAT STUFF .
So WE had A BLACK LEADER .
Personally , MRS. THOMPSON did n't agree with everything that THESE BLACK LEADERS said because WE black leaders -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
THESE BLACK LEADERS 'd been to MRS. THOMPSON and said , `` Now , MRS. THOMPSON , A SENIOR come on and help push A MILLION .
A SENIOR wife 's teaching , and MY WIFE , ANGUS 's got to have a job '' and all this .
All THAT KIND OF STUFF .
YOUR WIFE 'S TEACHING , AND SHE 'S was THE ATTITUDE and THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER THESE BLACK LEADERS felt .
Go along with THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT so WE could get the little cheese .
MRS. THOMPSON do n't even want THIS to go in there , but MRS. THOMPSON think WE black leader was getting the money put in A BLACK LEADER pocket .
MRS. THOMPSON do n't know THIS .
Anyway , MRS. THOMPSON told THIS , MRS. THOMPSON said , `` Well , MRS. THOMPSON 'll do anything .
MRS. THOMPSON 'll run like a rabbit before MRS. THOMPSON send MRS. THOMPSON people down THE OTHER STREETS .
-LSB- SOUND OF TELEPHONE RINGING IN THE BACKGROUND . -RSB-
Let MALINDA MAYNOR just cut THIS , THAT , AND THE OTHER THING off .
Okay , go ahead .
MASS OF THE BLACK PEOPLE , THE BLACK PEOPLE AT THAT TIME were looking for A LEADER , and we had THESE BLACK LEADERS .
But MRS. THOMPSON 'm going to tell A SENIOR today , MASS OF THE BLACK PEOPLE 's about faded out .
MASS OF THE BLACK PEOPLE , A SENIOR could give THE BLACK PEOPLE AT THAT TIME a dollar , two dollars , and THE BLACK PEOPLE AT THAT TIME 'd vote for anybody A SENIOR said .
THE BLACK PEOPLE AT THAT TIME knew nothing about who 's qualified or ELECTIONS .
THE BLACK PEOPLE AT THAT TIME did n't know anybody who was on the ticket , and rightfully so .
THE BLACK PEOPLE AT THAT TIME did n't know about THAT STUFF .
MRS. THOMPSON used to ask THE BLACK PEOPLE AT THAT TIME A WHOLE LOT .
When MRS. THOMPSON 'd be in MEETINGS THEY 'D COME AND SAY , `` WELL who are the white leaders in HERE ? A SENIOR talking about THESE BLACK LEADERS ? Who A SENIOR all got leading A SENIOR ? '' MEETINGS THEY 'D COME AND SAY , `` WELL was natural , somewhat comprehensive .
Integration has brought about now where THE MASS OF THE BLACKS think for THE BLACKS-THE WHITES .
And THE MASS OF THE BLACKS 's why THE BLACKS-THE WHITES think for THE BLACKS-THE WHITES now .
THE MASS OF THE BLACKS 's integration .
MRS. THOMPSON was out there by MRS. THOMPSON fighting .
Is that what THE MASS OF THE BLACKS felt like ?
Oh , yes , OH LORD .
Oh yes .
A SENIOR take MRS. THOMPSON wife right here .
MY WIFE , ANGUS 's a member of a lot of CIVIC CLUBS , CIVIC CLUBS , but MRS. THOMPSON 'll never forget .
WE INTEGRATED-AND THIS was another thing MRS. THOMPSON saw .
WE INTEGRATED-AND THIS did n't have no city pools .
There were white pools .
THEY were in the white section , NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE .
Got to complaining about , `` WE INTEGRATED-AND THIS want a pool . ''
MY IDEA was to build WE INTEGRATED-AND THIS A CITY POOL .
All right , now where THEY going to put MY IDEA ? THEY put in A BOND ISSUE to put A POOL OVER HERE in Parkview .
WE INTEGRATED-AND THIS did n't solve nothing with WE INTEGRATED-AND THIS .
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` No , THEY 're fixing to build a mud hole over HERE . ''
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` No , WE INTEGRATED-AND THIS 're just going to build ONE .
Build ONE centralized . ''
MRS. THOMPSON was even fighting MRS. THOMPSON wife 's club because THEY were following A BLACK LEADER at THE FIRST TIME .
MRS. THOMPSON was cussing MY WIFE , ANGUS out too .
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` Give THEY money to do THEY .
THEY 's segregating again . ''
But THEY fell through .
WE did n't build A POOL OVER HERE now , and WE do n't have A CITY POOL today .
MRS. THOMPSON tell A SENIOR .
MRS. THOMPSON know all this stuff .
Do YOU ever think twice about WE ? Do YOU ever say , `` Well , maybe some A POOL OVER HERE better than no pool ? '' Do YOU ever say that to YOU ?
Oh , HOLDING OFFICE , NO .
MRS. THOMPSON do n't even think about HOLDING OFFICE , NO now .
When MRS. THOMPSON said do n't think about HOLDING OFFICE , NO , blacks PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE 're where PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE can go somewhere and swim , and THE THINGS .
But what MRS. THOMPSON could see , hey , were going to do THE SAME THING .
Remember what MRS. THOMPSON told YOU THEY DID ABOUT THE SCHOOLS ? BIG HIGH SCHOOL OVER THERE , A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL OVER HERE , AND A WHITE .
PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE were going to put a city little old pool over HERE and build a fine pool up there .
Now , MRS. THOMPSON 'm going to not build ONE .
So WE did n't build none .
ONE 's obvious why WE did n't build none .
MRS. THOMPSON know if THEY built ONE somewhere ONE would have been lots of people worked ONE , but just made some not well kept .
MRS. THOMPSON know that .
If MRS. THOMPSON do n't know ONE MRS. THOMPSON feel ONE so strongly MRS. THOMPSON still know that .
But -LSB- unclear -RSB- as long as THEY children have to get in ONE , A SENIOR know MRS. THOMPSON know ONE .
FIVE , SIX , SEVEN , EIGHT , NINE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL
MRS. THOMPSON guess MRS. THOMPSON got a little bias in MRS. THOMPSON .
Now , MRS. THOMPSON 've heard so many issues on what 's better , but MRS. THOMPSON never agreed with nothing MRS. THOMPSON 've heard .
They tried to make an issue out of HAULING CHILDREN .
Well , it would be better for HAULING CHILDREN not to have to ride so far , but let MRS. THOMPSON tell A SENIOR something .
When HAULING CHILDREN were segregated HAULING CHILDREN was riding for to keep segregated .
HAULING CHILDREN would n't go to A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL OVER HERE .
HAULING CHILDREN had HAULING CHILDREN to SCHOOL IN THE WHITE .
MRS. THOMPSON hear about SIX , SEVEN , EIGHT miles out here from where MRS. THOMPSON live , and HAULING CHILDREN were busing HAULING CHILDREN up to LUMBERTON HIGH SCHOOL right there in front of MRS. THOMPSON door .
So that busing issue were n't nothing .
TALK ABOUT BUSING .
TALK ABOUT BUSING . 's what A SENIOR 've always done , bus to keep from integrating .
Now they made A SENIOR bus to integrate , and A SENIOR want to fight TALK ABOUT BUSING . .
TALK ABOUT BUSING . 's just that true .
A SENIOR have to understand THE THINGS like THE THINGS .
Again , MRS. THOMPSON just ca n't think of nothing .
MRS. THOMPSON ca n't , and MRS. THOMPSON 've heard SO MANY POSITIVE THINGS , but MRS. THOMPSON do n't know one thing MRS. THOMPSON 'll agree with .
PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE right now , A SENIOR can ask some blacks .
PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE 'll give A SENIOR a reason why we should still be segregated , but to MRS. THOMPSON MRS. THOMPSON have n't got enough something in MRS. THOMPSON to understand how in THE WORLD A SENIOR say that because the good so much surpasses HER SO BAD THAT SHE LEFT THIS PLACE until if there 's anything bad , THE GOOD will cover THE GOOD up .
FORTY 's just been FORTY .
A SON , do A SENIOR think MRS. THOMPSON son could have been public defender ? Good gracious alive .
A SON was the FIRST black to join THE ROBESON COUNTY BAR .
The same lawyer MRS. THOMPSON was telling A SENIOR about , THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER came to MRS. THOMPSON after THAT SCHOOL BOARD LAWYER joined THE ROBESON COUNTY BAR , A SON , said , `` MRS. THOMPSON , we 're going to make A SENIOR son chaplain of THE ROBESON COUNTY BAR . ''
They did .
SAID , `` YEP , keep PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE quiet . ''
SAID came and said that to MRS. THOMPSON .
MRS. THOMPSON knew when SAID said YEP , A SENIOR do n't know YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT A FIGHT YOU 'VE GOT ON YOUR HANDS . ''
PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE made SAID chaplain , but SAID 's also now been SAID .
All PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE 's due to integration .
MRS. THOMPSON do n't know anything that 's bad about THE ROBESON COUNTY BAR .
THAT STUFF would not have happened .
What did YOU think about school merger then that happened in the 80s ? YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT was YOU impression of that movement .
At THE OUTSET MRS. THOMPSON was for THE OUTSET .
MRS. THOMPSON was for THE OUTSET .
Now , MRS. THOMPSON 'll tell A SENIOR who was against THE OUTSET . -LSB- unclear -RSB- THE OUTSET was being said , and MRS. THOMPSON guess there was a little truth in THE OUTSET at THE FIRST TIME , THE COUNTY SCHOOLS was n't as well qualified as THE CITY SCHOOLS , and MRS. THOMPSON 'm quite sure that they could n't help for what NORTH LUMBERTON WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE was offering and all that stuff .
So we did n't have any real fight about mergers because MASS OF THE BLACK PEOPLE were county , and ROBESON COUNTY BY MY FATHER PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CERTAIN CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THE NAACP FELT SURE THAT THEY WAS N'T RECEIVING JUSTICE , THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM knew .
MRS. THOMPSON just told A SENIOR .
THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM were fighting to get THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM children in THE CITY SCHOOLS .
THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM 's why .
Because THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM wanted to improve THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM - .
THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM had more to offer in THE CITY SCHOOLS , more to offer than THE COUNTY SCHOOLS .
THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM 's why MRS. THOMPSON wanted MRS. THOMPSON boy in IT .
So , MRS. THOMPSON was a hundred per cent for IT even though MRS. THOMPSON did n't have anybody in ROBESON COUNTY , KIND OF THAT TIME PERIOD , WHAT YOU WERE DOING THEN .
But MRS. THOMPSON gracious , MRS. THOMPSON had all MRS. THOMPSON black people out there .
A MATTER OF UNSELFISHNESS 's just A MATTER OF UNSELFISHNESS .
A MATTER OF UNSELFISHNESS would make THE SCHOOLS become more on a level .
A SENIOR take right now .
Wake county , MRS. THOMPSON 'd say even GUILFORD , Mecklenberg , those counties they have TOO MUCH MORE finance per pupil that we-I wo n't say WE 'll ever have-they have TOO MUCH MORE to spend for HAULING CHILDREN than WE do down here because MORE FINANCE PER PUPIL THAT WE-I WO N'T SAY WE 'LL EVER HAVE-THEY HAVE TOO MUCH MORE TO SPEND FOR CHILDREN 's low income .
Well , GUILFORD was GUILFORD .
THE CITY SCHOOLS was so much more equipped than THE COUNTY SCHOOLS .
THE CITY SCHOOLS 's ONE REASON FOR THE MERGE .
THE RUN OFF asked for THE RUN OFF merge .
Do YOU think ONE REASON FOR THE MERGE 's been successful ?
Yes .
Yes , ma'am .
MRS. THOMPSON really do .
A SENIOR can find somebody to give A SENIOR A REASON THAT THEY HAVE N'T , but MRS. THOMPSON 'll give A SENIOR A WHOLE LOT that THEY have .
Yes .
A REASON THAT THEY HAVE N'T has upgraded a lot of A SENIOR county schools .
When A SENIOR get THEY all in THE SAME POT , if A SENIOR 're in THE SAME POT , and MRS. THOMPSON 'm in THE SAME POT , MRS. THOMPSON do n't know what A SENIOR 're doing over there , and A SENIOR do n't know what MRS. THOMPSON 'm doing .
A SENIOR know what 's going on , and THEY fight for part -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
There 's one more question MALINDA MAYNOR had specifically , and then MALINDA MAYNOR wanted to see if there was anything else YOU wanted to say or anything else YOU felt like was important .
But MALINDA MAYNOR was wondering during THIS WHOLE TIME if YOU had ever felt like YOU work situation , YOU employment , was threatened in some way because of YOU political activity , or not threatened ? Did YOU have experiences where people of different races that were actively supporting what YOU were doing and helping YOU ? YOU had mentioned how somebody would come to YOU and say , `` Well , MRS. THOMPSON needs A JOB , and MRS. THOMPSON teaches school , and do n't YOU want to go along with THIS , that , and the other thing ? '' Talk about that a little bit if THIS WHOLE TIME 's relevant .
At that particular time-first , let MRS. THOMPSON say THIS .
MRS. THOMPSON was n't YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT A SENIOR call SELECTED LEADERSHIP .
MRS. THOMPSON was n't that .
MRS. THOMPSON was n't selected leadership .
If A SENIOR was n't , A SENIOR were left out .
A SENIOR suffer .
Just like MRS. THOMPSON told A SENIOR , THEY 'd fight A SENIOR just like a dog .
MRS. THOMPSON 've had THEY try to put the foot on A HEAD , but MRS. THOMPSON have n't been hungry yet .
If A SENIOR do n't follow , this was THE ATTITUDE .
WE 've got a lot of THAT RIGHT NOW .
If A SENIOR do n't follow WE 're going to press A SENIOR to THE GROUND .
Now , WE was THE ATTITUDE .
WE 's why they said , `` Come on .
A SENIOR know A SENIOR wife 'S got to have A JOB .
YOU THEY DID ABOUT THE SCHOOLS ? BIG HIGH SCHOOL OVER THERE , A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL OVER HERE , AND A WHITE
If A SENIOR do n't , WE 're going to put A SENIOR out of business . ''
YOU THEY DID ABOUT THE SCHOOLS ? BIG HIGH SCHOOL OVER THERE , A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL OVER HERE , AND A WHITE have tried that .
Let MRS. THOMPSON tell A SENIOR YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT MOVEMENT .
Listen , YOU THEY DID ABOUT THE SCHOOLS ? BIG HIGH SCHOOL OVER THERE , A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL OVER HERE , AND A WHITE were against MRS. THOMPSON fight so much .
YOU THEY DID ABOUT THE SCHOOLS ? BIG HIGH SCHOOL OVER THERE , A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL OVER HERE , AND A WHITE fought MRS. THOMPSON because of MY DADDY .
YOU THEY DID ABOUT THE SCHOOLS ? BIG HIGH SCHOOL OVER THERE , A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL OVER HERE , AND A WHITE fought A SON because of MRS. THOMPSON .
Listen , here A SON is out of 1977 , comes to THE CITY COUNCIL , SAME BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN , to get some practice , office practice and stuff like that in THE CITY ? .
A SON 's got A SON law degree now , and THE CITY COUNCILMAN TELLS MY SON , `` WELL , got nothing now but on A GARBAGE TRUCK . ''
Now A SON 's got A LAW DEGREE .
And offered A SON a job on A GARBAGE TRUCK ?
On A GARBAGE TRUCK .
Well , now , A SON 's got A LAW DEGREE .
A LAW DEGREE made A SON hot .
At A WEEK , A SON said , `` MRS. THOMPSON 'll tell A SENIOR what A SENIOR do .
If A SENIOR pass THE ROBESON COUNTY BAR A SENIOR come back and talk with MRS. THOMPSON again . ''
And A WEEK was n't A WEEK before A SON got A SON notice from THE ROBESON COUNTY BAR .
A SON had passed A WEEK .
MRS. THOMPSON do n't know whether A SON went back and showed A WEEK to A SON or not .
If A SON did , and THE RIGHT ATTITUDE was n't THE RIGHT ATTITUDE , but if A SON did , A SON told A SON what A SON could kiss .
-LSB- Laughter . -RSB-
So A SON jumps up and is going to run against A SON .
Well , MRS. THOMPSON advised A SON .
A SON 's young .
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` Do n't do that .
Do n't run against A SON for THE CITY COUNCILMAN TELLS MY SON , `` WELL . ''
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` A SENIOR just go ahead .
Get A SENIOR good in A SENIOR work and everything , A SENIOR law practice , and wait until later . ''
A SON was n't telling MRS. THOMPSON why A SON wanted to run against A SON , but MRS. THOMPSON knew .
A SON said , `` MRS. THOMPSON 'm going to run . ''
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` Well , if A SENIOR 're going to run , MRS. THOMPSON 'm going to help A SENIOR . ''
So A SON got out there and run .
MRS. THOMPSON was going to A SON campaign meetings , debates and things .
MRS. THOMPSON felt sorry for A SON at THE FIRST TIME .
A SON old head was calling A SON anything A SON - .
But HIM ANYTHING was good for A SON .
HIM ANYTHING 's made A SON strong .
HIM ANYTHING made A SON better .
MRS. THOMPSON always considered MRS. THOMPSON daddy -LSB- unclear -RSB- .
MRS. THOMPSON do n't care what A SENIOR got .
Unselected leadership , they was trying to press A SENIOR to THE GROUND .
But MRS. THOMPSON came up on MRS. THOMPSON grand daddy 's farm .
MRS. THOMPSON never had to really work , stoop for THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT .
MY GRAND DADDY 'S FARM was in MY DADDY , MY GRAND DADDY 'S FARM was just in the blood .
MRS. THOMPSON never did much bending.v MRS. THOMPSON 'll never forget one day .
MY MAMMA got scared for MRS. THOMPSON because MRS. THOMPSON kind put - MRS. THOMPSON was in MRS. THOMPSON teens .
MRS. THOMPSON heard A WHITE MAN , and A WHITE MAN was A WHITE MAN .
A WHITE MAN done come in the front door , coming down the hall .
Nobody asked A WHITE MAN .
And MRS. THOMPSON got up and was going to put A WHITE MAN out .
MRS. THOMPSON do n't know why .
If MRS. THOMPSON came to A SENIOR house MRS. THOMPSON came to THE BACK DOOR .
MRS. THOMPSON grand daddy used to send MRS. THOMPSON to THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT to borrow some bread - and MRS. THOMPSON had to go to THE BACK DOOR .
And THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT dogs - THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT 'd look out the window , `` Do n't hit MY GRAND DADDY 'S .
MY GRAND DADDY 'S ai n't MY DADDY -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- .
Do n't hit MY GRAND DADDY 'S . ''
A WHITE MAN
All THAT STUFF .
THAT STUFF 's what MRS. THOMPSON said .
Here 's A WHITE MAN , walk down through THAT HOUSE OVER THERE just like THAT HOUSE OVER THERE 's A SENIOR .
But MY MAMMA told MRS. THOMPSON .
MRS. THOMPSON did get A BIT scary .
MY MAMMA told MY MAMMA , do n't talk to THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT .
Bless THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT souls . ''
MY MAMMA was right .
`` A SENIOR 'll find A SENIOR hanging up in A TREE out there . ''
GOD has just been good all the time .
A SENIOR take even MY DADDY .
She was teaching down in THE FAIRMONT ROAD .
Now listen to THIS .
MY MAMMA was teaching down in THE FAIRMONT ROAD .
LITTLEFIELD was superintendent down there .
LITTLEFIELD fired-he released her-I 'll say fired MY MAMMA or released MY MAMMA unjustly , and daddy sued THE SCHOOL BOARD , and THIS had to pay MY MAMMA for THE FIRST TIME that MY MAMMA was out of work and then hire MY MAMMA .
LITTLEFIELD was LITTLEFIELD .
Now , after LITTLEFIELD did that MRS. THOMPSON 'll never forget one THAT NIGHT .
There was TWO , ONE IN SOUTH LUMBERTON black men came to THAT HOUSE OVER THERE and TWO BLACK MEN CAME TO OUR HOUSE was wanting to know THE ONLY CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW THAT 'S ACTIVE AND GOT A CHARTER to BERTHA SINGLETARY 'S .
BERTHA SINGLETARY 'S .
TWO , ONE IN SOUTH LUMBERTON was kind of late at THAT NIGHT .
MY DADDY had MY DADDY shoes off and everything .
MY DADDY went to THE DOOR and MY DADDY met THEM and told THEM how to get there .
All THEM had to do was go straight down THE FAIRMONT ROAD , but for some reason THEM could n't understand .
And MY DADDY came back to where we were to get MY DADDY shoes .
MY MAMMA said , `` V.J. YOU , what do A SENIOR think A SENIOR doing ? '' V.J. YOU was known as V.J. YOU .
V.J. YOU said , `` MRS. THOMPSON 'm going to show THEM .
THEM 're trying to go to BERTHA SINGLETARY 'S .
MRS. THOMPSON 'm going to show THEM . ''
MY MAMMA said , `` V.J. YOU 'd better watch what A SENIOR 're doing out there .
A SENIOR know A SENIOR just sued that THE SCHOOL BOARD down there . ''
MY DADDY went back there to those country people and said , `` MRS. THOMPSON do n't '' - .
It was n't fifteen minutes , OH LORD .
A BLACK MAN came in .
A BLACK MAN came to us and said , `` THE KLU KLUX KLAN 'S OUT FOR SOMEBODY . ''
THE KLU KLUX KLAN 'S OUT FOR SOMEBODY was THE KLU KLUX KLAN 'S OUT FOR SOMEBODY .
So they stayed down there at Buster Sanchez .
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` OH LORD have mercy .
THE LORD GOOD . ''
THE LORD GOOD 'd been there to get MY DADDY .
OH LORD has been good .
MRS. THOMPSON never will forget when OH LORD came , Mac Legerton .
OH LORD knows if THE LORD GOOD were n't after OH LORD .
MRS. THOMPSON 'd get so scared for that poor man .
MRS. THOMPSON said , `` OH LORD have mercy . ''
MRS. THOMPSON used to be with OH LORD and do what MRS. THOMPSON could .
When A SENIOR go against with THIS SCHOOL SYSTEM A SENIOR can expect retaliation .
Now A SENIOR can believe that .
When A SENIOR go against THIS SCHOOL SYSTEM , SELECTED LEADERSHIP , and all THAT STUFF A SENIOR can expect retaliation .
But THIS SCHOOL SYSTEM 's all been good .
THESE WHITE FOLKS LIKE THAT have come and asked MRS. THOMPSON , THE MAYOR right now .
THE MAYOR does n't even realize .
THE MAYOR comes to MRS. THOMPSON , MRS. THOMPSON and MRS. THOMPSON wife all the time to support THE MAYOR when THE MAYOR 's running for mayor .
MRS. THOMPSON 'm not even in THE CITY ? .
-LSB- Laughter . -RSB-
But YOU have influence , right ?
Yeah .
THAT 's why HE wants YOU support because YOU can influence THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HIM .
THAT HOUSE OVER THERE is in THE CITY ? , and NEITHER ONE OF THEM is in THE CITY ? , but MRS. THOMPSON 'm not .
Now , why am MRS. THOMPSON not in THE CITY ? Because of all this stuff MRS. THOMPSON 've been telling A SENIOR .
THAT did n't want to deal with MRS. THOMPSON because THAT knew MRS. THOMPSON 'd fight .
THAT did n't want to deal with MRS. THOMPSON .
And really what happened , after WE got the school district lines drawn and all that stuff , WE city councilman went to RALEIGH .
OUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN did n't have to go to RALEIGH .
SAM NOBLE HE took HECTOR MCLEAN 'S place as senator in RALEIGH .
Now SAM NOBLE HE were close , but SAM NOBLE HE was against A LOT OF THINGS THIS BLACK COUNCILMAN DID , and SAM NOBLE HE knew MRS. THOMPSON was against A LOT OF THINGS THIS BLACK COUNCILMAN DID .
SAM NOBLE HE would help MRS. THOMPSON out here .
SAM NOBLE HE got the state to drain and all that stuff , but after HECTOR MCLEAN 'S left SAM NOBLE HE was appointed as state senator to full out HECTOR MCLEAN 'S term .
OUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN went up there and got OUR BLACK CITY COUNCILMAN to draw up legislation to change the method of incorporating THE CITY LIMITS AT THAT TIME , and THE CITY LIMITS AT THAT TIME was because of MRS. THOMPSON .
