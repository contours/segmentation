This is an interview with ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. .
At ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. law firm Dominic , Fletcher , Yielding , Wood and Lloyd in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA .
Today 's date is Tuesday , May 27 , 2003 , and the interviewer is WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON .
If YOU could please just state YOU name we 'll see how the mike is doing .
YOUR NAME is ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. .
THOSE PEOPLE call ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. ART .
Some people , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess , by VIRTUE OF THE HONORIFIC CALL ME JUDGE .
Okay , so maybe YOU can tell WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON a little bit about YOU childhood and growing up ?
Surely .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was born before WORLD WAR II , right as WORLD WAR II started .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. remember very well ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad was A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC during WORLD WAR II .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. remember THOSE DAYS well .
After THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC came back and went to LAW SCHOOL on THE GI BILL .
A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC and MY MOTHER 'S were good card players and supplemented THE GI BILL by playing THE CARDS at THAT NIGHT .
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER is , although A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC would never admit THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER , mother was a very fine card player .
A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC would leave MY MOTHER 'S sleeping in THE MORNING and take ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. to LAW SCHOOL .
It was n't long after that that ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. went to LAW SCHOOL so ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. remembered that very well .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. grand daddy was THE ONLY GENERAL EVANGELIST THE NORTH ALABAMA METHODISTS EVER HAD .
THE ONLY GENERAL EVANGELIST THE NORTH ALABAMA METHODISTS EVER HAD was born at the site of Phillips High School downtown before CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM was CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was raised here during the war with ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad 's FIVE sisters and MY MOTHER 'S mother and daddy .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was basically raised by ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. aunts and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. grandmother during THOSE YEARS .
Thereafter ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. traveled with ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. family .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was raised in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM , but WE lived in Chicago and Washington , D. C. when ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad was in THE FBI .
Then WE came back and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. went to WOODLAWN HIGH SCHOOL here , and from there went to PRINCETON .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. played football A VERY , VERY FINE FOOTBALL SCHOOL .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. supposed ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. , but everybody got scholarships .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. , of course , were to places like Sewanee and Ripon College , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was invited to walk on at VANDERBILT .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. wanted to play for the new coach at ALABAMA .
Coach PAUL BRYANT had been there a couple of THOSE YEARS and had a couple of ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. teammates with PAUL BRYANT , so ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. went down to talk with PAUL BRYANT about going to ALABAMA .
PAUL BRYANT said , `` Artie , YOU can walk on A VERY , VERY FINE FOOTBALL SCHOOL , but YOU 're too little to play for ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think YOU ought to take that brain and go up to that Ivy League and play some of that sissy ball . ''
It was THE BEST ADVICE I EVER GOT FROM A MAN NOT MY FATHER .
So THE BEST ADVICE I EVER GOT FROM A MAN NOT MY FATHER 's how ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. wound up at PRINCETON .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. came back to ALABAMA to LAW SCHOOL .
GREAT .
So tell WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON A LITTLE BIT about when YOU FIRST started practicing law .
Well , are YOU talking about legally or de facto .
In 1965 ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was in LAW SCHOOL , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad had left the office of MAYOR OF BIRMINGHAM and not run for a second term .
A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC had gone back to the private practice of law , and was offered A HORRIBLY UNPOPULAR CASE , and Robert Thomas who were Klansmen charged with killing VIOLA LIUZZO ON THE SELMA to MONTGOMERY march .
At THAT TIME A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC was in the position where A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC could have gone with industry here as a result of a good eastern education and good fortune in LAW SCHOOL .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was in a position to have some of those pretty good jobs at the big law firms .
WE discussed whether WE were going to be TRIAL LAWYERS or whether WE were going to go for the secure silk stocking life , and WE decided to partner up when ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. finished LAW SCHOOL , and take THE CASES , and try THE CASES together .
So MY LAW PROFESSOR let ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. off for two weeks in the fall of '65 to try Collin Leroy Wilkins down in Hayneville with YOUR FATHER 'S , and MY LAW PROFESSOR was acquitted .
Then WE tried EUGENE THOMAS several months later .
WE tried Eugene Thomas in front of a jury of eight black men and FOUR white men .
Got AN ACQUITTAL in the killing of VIOLA LIUZZO ON THE SELMA .
In THOSE DAYS there were only the THE THREE OF US television channels , and TRIAL LAWYERS were strictly forbidden to advertise , and just the turn of THE CARDS and the way fate worked , WE had a fairly national law practice which lead to JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. went to LONDON .
LONDON was in 1968 , and undertook to represent JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED .
As WE speak now ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm the only person alive who ever prepared THE MARTIN LUTHER KING CASE FOR TRIAL , and THE MARTIN LUTHER KING CASE FOR TRIAL was WE turn of EVENTS .
JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED changed TRIAL LAWYERS on SUNDAY THAT NIGHT before WE were due to go to trial on MONDAY .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had spent all day FRIDAY with JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED .
WE were due to go to trial on MONDAY .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. came back to CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM to get ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad and WE files .
WE got to Memphis on SUNDAY THAT NIGHT to do SOME FINAL THINGS , take A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC a suit of clothes WE 'd gotten for A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC .
WE just got a note that A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC had changed TRIAL LAWYERS , so naturally WE packed up and left THE NEXT MORNING .
By Thursday A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC was calling saying , `` ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. made the worst mistake ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. ever made in MY LIFE .
All this guy wants ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. to do is plead guilty .
Please come back and try THE MARTIN LUTHER KING CASE FOR TRIAL . ''
WE would not go back , and ultimately in a bizarre turn of EVENTS , THE LAWYER FROM TEXAS had been waiting , and VIRTUE OF THE HONORIFIC CALL ME JUDGE allowed VIRTUE OF THE HONORIFIC CALL ME JUDGE to spend the weekend in the cell with JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED .
THE LAWYER FROM TEXAS got in there right after ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. left on FRIDAY .
Talked JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED was calling WE to come back .
Of course , ultimately , THE LAWYER FROM TEXAS did pressure THE LAWYER FROM TEXAS into pleading guilty which JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED renounced immediately .
A SIDELIGHT , not what YOU 're here for , but ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm reasonably convinced JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED did not fire the shot the killed MARTIN LUTHER KING .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. could convince YOU of A SIDELIGHT if ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had about thirty minutes to do so .
Huh .
Anyway , A SIDELIGHT 's A SIDELIGHT that WE were doing through THOSE YEARS .
WE were TRIAL LAWYERS .
POP agreed that WE were going to be courageous lawyers , that WE would undertake unpopular causes for reasonable fees of course .
And WE did .
WE represented SOME REALLY , REALLY HORRIBLE , EVIL PEOPLE THAT DID SOME HORRIBLE , EVIL THINGS .
WE won some and lost some .
Does that answer A NATURAL SEQUENCE about the beginning of the law practice A LITTLE BIT ?
A NATURAL SEQUENCE does .
A NATURAL SEQUENCE certainly does .
So how did YOU come to represent BOB CHAMBLISS ' ?
Well , A NATURAL SEQUENCE was A NATURAL SEQUENCE .
WE had through THOSE YEARS undertaken some brutally unpopular cases on all sides of the spectrum .
In THOSE DAYS , interestingly , A LAWYER , A LAWYER WITHOUT PERSONAL could be A LAWYER , A LAWYER WITHOUT PERSONAL , and WE devoted WE to being TRIAL LAWYERS , to representing clients , and WE represented Ku Klux Klansmen , Black Panthers .
YOU could do THOSE DAYS then .
YOU did n't have to paint YOU with the brush of YOU client .
YOU did n't have to undertake YOU client 's cause to undertake YOU client 's case , so it was not an unnatural call for WE to receive when BOB CHAMBLISS ' called WE to represent BOB CHAMBLISS ' in BOB CHAMBLISS ' case .
By THEN ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was sitting in THE FRONT CHAIR WHICH IS THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF THINGS , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad was slowing down some .
WE had started out with THEN making all of the calls and sitting in THE FRONT CHAIR WHICH IS THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF THINGS .
WE 's how WE got into THE FRONT CHAIR WHICH IS THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF THINGS .
So how did YOU prepare YOU defense for BOB CHAMBLISS ' ?
Well , A HORRIBLY UNPOPULAR CASE was A HORRIBLY UNPOPULAR CASE .
For instance , in the JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED case WE theory and WE theme was that JAMES EARL RAY CALLING US FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED could not have acted alone .
THE STATE 'S was stuck with the theory that James Earl Ray acting alone fired the shot that killed MARTIN LUTHER KING .
In THE RAY CASE , THE LIUZZO CASE , of course WE had n't seen the panel yet , but WE had pretty well come to THE CONCLUSION that WE were going to strike A JURY LOOKING TOWARD AN ALL BLACK JURY IF WE COULD POSSIBLY GET IT , THINKING THAT IN THOSE DAYS THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IN MEMPHIS HAD AN UNREASONABLE FEAR OF REPERCUSSIONS IF THERE WERE NO CONVICTION AND WANTED TO CLOSE THE BOOK , and WE idea of THE CONCLUSION was do n't close THE BOOK .
Do n't let them close THE BOOK .
TEN YEARS AFTER THE RAY CASE was different .
TEN YEARS AFTER THE RAY CASE was TEN YEARS AFTER THE RAY CASE , nine years .
Of course WE set out to determine what the facts were , as YOU do , to see WHAT WOULD WORK AND WHAT WOULD N'T WORK .
BOB CHAMBLISS ' always denied having done WHAT WOULD WORK AND WHAT WOULD N'T WORK , but had no claimed recollection of anything .
So WE plan was to try the weakness of THE STATE 'S case , put the burden proof of the state which all defense lawyers , all defendants have to rely on .
WE theme of THE STATE 'S CASE was that BOB CHAMBLISS ' was just a mean , racist old man , as there were 30,000 of in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM in 1963 , that BOB CHAMBLISS ' was rough talking , that BOB CHAMBLISS ' was rough , and that BOB CHAMBLISS ' was mean , but 1963 did n't mean that BOB CHAMBLISS ' did this horrible crime .
OUR THEME OF THE CASE was WE approach .
Of course WE knew , WE 'd gotten OUR THEME OF THE CASE from the indictment , but BOB CHAMBLISS ' was known as BOB CHAMBLISS ' .
BOB CHAMBLISS ' had quite a history of violence and the like around CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM .
WE plan was put BOB CHAMBLISS ' up there , let BOB CHAMBLISS ' deny OUR PLAN , let it be seen how mean BOB CHAMBLISS ' was .
WE knew that THE GI BILL was just going to eat THE GI BILL alive with THESE OTHER THINGS , because by putting THE GI BILL up there that would open THE DOOR to many of THESE OTHER THINGS , but THESE OTHER THINGS was all right .
WE plan for THE STATE 'S CASE was that THE STATE 'S CASE 's how THE STATE 'S CASE would play out .
WE figured that THE GI BILL would be mean and would show how mean THE GI BILL was .
WE 's what WE were going to do .
THE WHOLE WAY 's THE WHOLE WAY that WE approached THE TRIAL .
In fact , BOB CHAMBLISS ' led ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. into being judge .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'll tell YOU HOW .
Just like in THE RAY CASE , THE LIUZZO CASE ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. try not to be A CONSPIRACY NUT .
In fact , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. try not to be any kind of A CONSPIRACY NUT .
In TEN YEARS AFTER THE RAY CASE ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. try not to be spooky or eerie , but let ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. just tell YOU an experience ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had .
Okay .
OUR only witness was going to be BOB CHAMBLISS ' .
TEN YEARS AFTER THE RAY CASE had gone some days better than others in the course of THE TRIAL .
OUR 'd won some battles and lost SOME BATTLES , but SOME BATTLES 's all right .
TEN YEARS AFTER THE RAY CASE came THE MOMENT I , and VIRTUE OF THE HONORIFIC CALL ME JUDGE looked down and said , `` ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. . ''
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. stood up , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. looked down at BOB CHAMBLISS ' , and said , `` Take YOUR TURN TO TESTIFY BOB CHAMBLISS ' . ''
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'll never forget YOUR TURN TO TESTIFY .
BOB CHAMBLISS ' looked up at ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. and said , `` No . ''
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` BOB ! YOU DID N'T UNDERSTAND ME .
YOUR TURN TO TESTIFY 's YOU turn to testify .
Go take YOUR TURN TO TESTIFY . ''
BOB ! YOU DID N'T UNDERSTAND ME said , `` ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm not going . ''
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. try not to be , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. know that in retrospect YOUR TURN TO TESTIFY 's not as ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. remember YOUR TURN TO TESTIFY , but from this vantage point ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. swear HIS FACE shimmered with evil as ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. looked at HIS FACE .
YOUR TURN TO TESTIFY was at THE MOMENT I that ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. knew to a certainty WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON was WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON .
Somewhere deep inside ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. , when WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON was looking up at ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. and said , `` ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm not going , '' -- WE were in front of the entire world -- ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. knew right that moment ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was n't going spend the rest of ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. life defending and cashing ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. , and bleeding ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. heart out for SOME REALLY , REALLY HORRIBLE , EVIL PEOPLE THAT DID SOME HORRIBLE , EVIL THINGS any more .
At any rate , WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON insisted on not testifying .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON would n't have been so bad , and then to compound things WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON insisted on calling SOME OF HIS SORRY OLD BUDDIES to testify as to WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON character , and THE NET RESULT OF THAT was WE did n't have WE story , and yet WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON opened THE DOOR so THE GI BILL could just nail THE GI BILL with all this other reputation stuff .
Naturally , WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON was convicted .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. did THE ABSOLUTE , DEAD LEVEL BEST I COULD TO PREVENT IT , but ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm telling WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON .
So THE ABSOLUTE , DEAD LEVEL BEST I COULD TO PREVENT IT 's THE ABSOLUTE , DEAD LEVEL BEST I COULD TO PREVENT IT .
So YOU made THAT DECISION , and THAT DECISION 's HOW -- ?
Then the opportunity came , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. became A CIRCUIT JUDGE here .
WE are divided into divisions , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. spent THE NEXT NEARLY TWENTY YEARS trying nothing but civil cases which ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had done a good bit of as A LAWYER , A LAWYER WITHOUT PERSONAL also .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 've enjoyed writing and serving on committees .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. helped write THE RULES OF EVIDENCE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. wrote a domestic relations book .
YOU know , just piddling around , A NUTSHELL RENDITION of thing .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess A NUTSHELL RENDITION 's A NUTSHELL RENDITION .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Can WE talk about a few of THE WITNESSES ?
Sure .
Maybe WE can start with ELIZABETH COBBS , THE NIECE/NEPHEW . .
ELIZABETH COBBS , THE NIECE/NEPHEW .
Yes , ELIZABETH COBBS , THE NIECE/NEPHEW . .
ELIZABETH COBBS , THE NIECE/NEPHEW . always claimed that ELIZABETH COBBS , THE NIECE/NEPHEW . was THE KEY to the deal .
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER is ELIZABETH COBBS , THE NIECE/NEPHEW . did n't prove a thing , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. did n't think .
ELIZABETH COBBS , THE NIECE/NEPHEW . alone meant absolutely nothing .
ELIZABETH COBBS , THE NIECE/NEPHEW . was just a weird , shaky person .
THE PERSON THAT CONVICTED BOB CHAMBLISS was THE LADY FROM DETROIT WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN HIM THAT MORNING SITTING IN THE CAR .
DETROIT 's who convicted THE PERSON THAT CONVICTED BOB CHAMBLISS .
The niece standing alone would have had no consequence whatever .
In fact , THE LADY FROM DETROIT WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN HIM THAT MORNING SITTING IN THE CAR fit right into OUR plan of THE PERSON THAT CONVICTED BOB CHAMBLISS was just a mean old man .
Just a mean old racist man .
THE LADY FROM DETROIT WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN HIM THAT MORNING SITTING IN THE CAR was of NO CONSEQUENCE WE FELT .
How as NO CONSEQUENCE WE FELT to prepare a defense for A CASE THAT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD ?
NO CONSEQUENCE WE FELT was very , very difficult in THE SENSE THAT CHAMBLISS COULD AT LEAST CREDIBLY DENY THE MEMORY OF IT IN RETROSPECT .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. believe BOB CHAMBLISS ' remembered everything that BOB CHAMBLISS ' did THAT NIGHT , but THE REAL TRUTH OF IT , THE REAL TRUTH OF IT is that THE REAL TRUTH OF IT , THE REAL TRUTH OF IT 's harder on the state than THE DEFENDANT .
THAT NIGHT 's THE REAL TRUTH OF IT because THEY have the burden of proof , and just as THE DEFENSE WITNESSES die and become missing so also do THE STATE 'S witnesses .
In the absence of SOME OF THEIR WITNESSES SOME OF THEIR WITNESSES have a much harder time .
So in general terms ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. would guess that A HORRIBLE DISADVANTAGE TO THE DEFENDANT would be that , `` Oh A HORRIBLE DISADVANTAGE TO THE DEFENDANT 's A HORRIBLE DISADVANTAGE TO THE DEFENDANT . ''
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER is , on a level playing field THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER 's probably as hard or harder on THE STATE 'S .
Every now and THEN YOU get THE CASES where YOU have A CONVICTION regardless .
In the BOB CHAMBLISS ' case with A JURY LOOKING TOWARD AN ALL BLACK JURY IF WE COULD POSSIBLY GET IT , THINKING THAT IN THOSE DAYS THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IN MEMPHIS HAD AN UNREASONABLE FEAR OF REPERCUSSIONS IF THERE WERE NO CONVICTION AND WANTED TO CLOSE THE BOOK WE had , probably THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER is THEY could never have acquitted .
A HUNG JURY would be A HUNG JURY because , in those days at THAT TIME , there would always have been somebody on the jury who simply could not have gone back to THEY work , THEY church with an acquittal in A CASE THAT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD .
So the reality of that case at THAT TIME was there could never have been AN ACQUITTAL .
This day and time of trying THOSE PEOPLE in THE MEDIA , WE had SOME HUGE NATIONAL CASES WHERE PEOPLE WERE TRIED IN THE MEDIA , BUT THOSE WERE BEFORE CNN AND THE TIME NOW WHERE YOU HAVE ALL OF THE ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE CASES THAT THEY JUST PEG OUT , like the Lacey Peterson case for instance .
Everybody in THE COUNTRY has an opinion on A CASE THAT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD now .
WE were trying SOME HUGE NATIONAL CASES WHERE PEOPLE WERE TRIED IN THE MEDIA , BUT THOSE WERE BEFORE CNN AND THE TIME NOW WHERE YOU HAVE ALL OF THE ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE CASES THAT THEY JUST PEG OUT before there were any cases , in TEN YEARS AFTER THE RAY CASE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. gracious , THE RAY CASE , THE LIUZZO CASE had THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES down here .
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES announced the arrest by name .
In THE RAY CASE , THE LIUZZO CASE , EUGENE THOMAS was standing in a filling station in Bessemer filling THE CAR up with gasoline , and VIOLA LIUZZO ON THE SELMA heard THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES come on the radio , announce YOUR NAME , and announce that there was an arrest warrant for THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE UNITED STATES 'll curl YOU hair .
THE RAY CASE , THE LIUZZO CASE 'll curl YOU hair .
So how was THE FIRST OF THE TIMES , TOTALLY UNDESERVED NONETHELESS TRUE received in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM in 77 ? Do YOU feel like there was relief ?
Probably .
Probably .
THE FIRST OF THE TIMES , TOTALLY UNDESERVED NONETHELESS TRUE was THE FIRST OF THE TIMES , TOTALLY UNDESERVED NONETHELESS TRUE , CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM had been pilloried in the media of THE WORLD , THAT LIFE WOULD GO ON , and there was THIS COLLECTIVE SOCIETAL DESIRE TO PURGE OURSELVES OF THIS DEMON , so ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think THIS COLLECTIVE SOCIETAL DESIRE TO PURGE OURSELVES OF THIS DEMON probably was well received at THAT TIME .
What about THE RECENT SIXTEENTH STREET CASES , THE RECENT SIXTEENTH STREET CASES ? THE RECENT SIXTEENTH STREET CASES was BLANTON and CHERRY a couple of FOURTEEN YEARS .
Well , in TEN YEARS AFTER THE RAY CASE THE EVIDENCE was such that probably THE TWO OF THEM could well have been prosecuted on THE EVIDENCE .
THE GI BILL left THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL and left public life at THAT TIME .
THE NET RESULT OF THAT was THE NET RESULT OF THAT just never was picked up again .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'll say THIS ABOUT BLANTON AND CHERRY .
TRIAL LAWYERS were able to carry off a very , very difficult defense , again with dignity and without exacerbating THE PROBLEMS and the nature of THE STATE 'S CASE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. commend TRIAL LAWYERS for TRIAL LAWYERS .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON went to the BLANTON trial and listened to THE FBI TAPES , THE FBI TAPES , and WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON was wondering if YOU had MY OPINION OF IT about whether or not THE END OF THE WORLD , THAT LIFE WOULD GO ON should have gone in ?
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do , but ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. friend Judge Jim Garrett was on the bench at THE SAME TIME ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was and , frankly , WE discussed those at THAT TIME , not necessarily because ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. knew anything about THE STATE 'S CASE but because ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was one of the authors of WE rules of evidence .
Oh , okay .
MY FRIEND JUDGE JIM GARRETT 's one of the problems with trying A CASE so long after the fact .
The law changes , and the question of what law to apply .
For instance , when we tried BOB CHAMBLISS ' BOB CHAMBLISS ' could n't get the death penalty .
If BOB CHAMBLISS ' 'd been tried in 1963 , 64 , or 65 BOB CHAMBLISS ' could have .
SOME FINAL THINGS change over THE COURSE OF TIME , and THE COURSE OF TIME becomes very difficult from a legal point of MY VIEW OF ALL OF THAT .
THE COURSE OF TIME 's THE COURSE OF TIME .
Who was SKAKEL , SKAKEL that was tried .
Is n't that SKAKEL name .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON think so , yeah .
Tried '62 , THE NEXT NEARLY TWENTY YEARS or thirty years after the alleged act ?
Right .
'62 is so very , very difficult from A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW .
'62 skews SOME FINAL THINGS .
'62 adds a factor that 's not fair either for THE DEFENDANT or against THE DEFENDANT , but almost invariably there is A REASON OTHER THAN THE ULTIMATE DESIRE TO BRING A OFFENDER TO JUSTICE IN THESE LATE COMING TRIALS .
THEY 're skewed .
THEY 're skewed A LITTLE BIT .
UM-HUM .
Not JUST THOSE KIND OF MURDER TRIALS , but there have been JUST THOSE KIND OF MURDER TRIALS .
JUST THOSE KIND OF MURDER TRIALS 's right .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 've always -- ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'd say not always -- ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. have said that BOB CHAMBLISS ' was BOB CHAMBLISS ' .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. turned down an unpopular case just because OF THE -- ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. wo n't tell YOU what we talked about or what BOB CHAMBLISS ' said -- but Byron De La Beckwith asked ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. to represent BOB CHAMBLISS ' at ONE TIME IN THE MEDGER EVERS CASE , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. just could n't do ONE TIME IN THE MEDGER EVERS CASE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm sorry .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. prided ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. on being A LAWYER , A LAWYER WITHOUT PERSONAL -- PERSONAL 's another story .
Never mind .
But yeah .
THE GI BILL told QUITE THAT GOOD that YOU had told THE GI BILL about going and telling BOB CHAMBLISS ' wife -- .
Ah .
Would YOU like to hear that story from ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. ?
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON would .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON would .
WE tried THE STATE 'S CASE and , if there is such a thing as a moral victory when YOU whole defense has been torpedoed as BOB CHAMBLISS ' insisted on torpedoing BOB CHAMBLISS ' own defense , A JURY LOOKING TOWARD AN ALL BLACK JURY IF WE COULD POSSIBLY GET IT , THINKING THAT IN THOSE DAYS THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IN MEMPHIS HAD AN UNREASONABLE FEAR OF REPERCUSSIONS IF THERE WERE NO CONVICTION AND WANTED TO CLOSE THE BOOK deliberated one afternoon , was out one THAT NIGHT , deliberated several hours , and came back late the following morning .
They came in with A CONVICTION , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. and Judge Mike Bolen who is WE probate judge here was ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. , sat at the table , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. brother Tom , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. conferred after the immediate flurry after THE FIRST OF THE TIMES , TOTALLY UNDESERVED NONETHELESS TRUE came down .
`` MISS TEE , BOB CHAMBLISS ' wife , was A WONDERFUL , SWEET , GENTLE SOLE , A WONDERFUL , SWEET , GENTLE SOLE .
BOB CHAMBLISS ' WIFE had n't been at THE TRIAL , and WE needed to tell Tee .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. told MY PARTNERS , `` MY PARTNERS , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'll take the rap .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. sat in THE FRONT CHAIR WHICH IS THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF THINGS .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. made the arguments .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'll go tell `` MISS TEE .
So ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. went to THEIR house in NORTH BIRMINGHAM .
THEIR HOUSE was in A CHANGING NEIGHBORHOOD , MIXED RACES THROUGHOUT .
It was A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD LIVED MOST ALL OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE .
A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD LIVED MOST ALL OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE was A CHANGING NEIGHBORHOOD , MIXED RACES THROUGHOUT .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. went THE FRONT DOOR , and THE FRONT DOOR was one of those clear , rare , low humidity THOSE DAYS JUST , in the 70s maybe .
THE FRONT DOOR was open , but A SMALL LITTLE TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN NORTH BIRMINGHAM was shut , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. could see A SMALL LITTLE TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN NORTH BIRMINGHAM was dark inside .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. rapped on A SMALL LITTLE TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN NORTH BIRMINGHAM .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. could hear THIS FAINT LITTLE VOICE , `` Who is A SMALL LITTLE TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN NORTH BIRMINGHAM ? '' ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` `` MISS TEE , THIS FAINT LITTLE VOICE 's ART . ''
`` Come in . ''
And ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. opened A SMALL LITTLE TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN NORTH BIRMINGHAM , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. stepped into THEIR LITTLE LIVING ROOM .
A SMALL LITTLE TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN NORTH BIRMINGHAM was A SMALL LITTLE TWO BEDROOM HOUSE IN NORTH BIRMINGHAM .
She was lying there on THE SOFA and , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know , maybe ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. read too much great literature at PRINCETON , but ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had these pictures in ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. mind .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. could see the dust motes floating through the slanting rays of SUNLIGHT , THE FEW THAT WERE FILTERING INTO THE ROOM .
SUNLIGHT , THE FEW THAT WERE FILTERING INTO THE ROOM was cool , and THE FEW THAT WERE FILTERING INTO THE ROOM was lying there on THE SOFA .
As A SOUTHERN LADY YOU will appreciate the phrase , `` As if A SOUTHERN LADY had the vapors . ''
Yes .
A SOUTHERN LADY was lying there .
A SOUTHERN LADY had A LITTLE RAG ON HER FOREHEAD , and ONE HAND lying over HER FOREHEAD .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. scootched THE WHOLE WAY onto A LITTLE EDGE OF THE SOFA where A SOUTHERN LADY was lying , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` MISS TEE , . ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 've got bad news for YOU . ''
A SOUTHERN LADY said , `` What is THE WHOLE WAY ? '' ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` `` MISS TEE , THEY convicted BOB CHAMBLISS ' . ''
A SOUTHERN LADY said , `` THEY convicted BOB CHAMBLISS ' ? '' And ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` Yes , mam . ''
A SOUTHERN LADY said , `` When will BOB CHAMBLISS ' be coming home ? '' ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` `` MISS TEE , BOB CHAMBLISS ' wo n't be coming home . ''
A SOUTHERN LADY pulled A LITTLE RAG ON HER FOREHEAD off HER HEAD , and A SOUTHERN LADY said , `` BOB CHAMBLISS ' wo n't be corning home ? '' And ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` No , mam '' A SOUTHERN LADY said , `` Do YOU promise ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. ? '' ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` Yes , mam . ''
A SOUTHERN LADY ripped that rag off HER HEAD .
A SOUTHERN LADY stood up in the middle of THEIR LITTLE LIVING ROOM and said , `` Praise GOD ! PRAISE GOD ! '' Opened the curtains , and the light came in .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. knew at THE MOMENT I , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. knew at that very moment that ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. instinct was right , that GOD ! PRAISE GOD ! '' was GOD ! PRAISE GOD ! '' . ''
Is that about THE WAY BILL tells QUITE THAT GOOD ?
Yeah , QUITE THAT GOOD was n't QUITE THAT GOOD .
But GOD ! PRAISE GOD ! '' was n't there .
GOD ! PRAISE GOD ! '' ca n't tell QUITE THAT GOOD quite that well .
GOD ! PRAISE GOD ! '' was n't there , but THE GI BILL can tell QUITE THAT GOOD , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. can assure YOU .
Well , thank YOU .
Thank YOU .
What SOMEWHERE ELSE about THE TRIAL ? WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON 've talked to Mr. Baxley A LITTLE BIT about this , but why do YOU think that BOB CHAMBLISS ' was n't tried in 63 , or in the few years right after THAT TIME ?
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know .
THE TRIAL 's hard to tell .
THE WAY BILL would probably have a better idea than ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do .
In THE FIRST PLACE , THE FBI had much of THE EVIDENCE , and the FBI in THOSE DAYS JUST did n't cooperate with LOCAL POLICE .
THE FIRST PLACE had nothing to do with race necessarily or THE KINDS OF THINGS .
LOCAL POLICE were just very closed mouthed .
LOCAL POLICE did not give information .
LOCAL POLICE took information .
LOCAL POLICE was true whether YOU were talking about racketeering , or CIVIL RIGHTS , or bank robberies , or whatever it was .
OUR THEME OF THE CASE was just LOCAL POLICE approach to law enforcement .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. would think in part the lack of access to THE FBI information .
THE WAY BILL had SOME but probably did n't have all of it .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think even Doug Jones had difficulty getting all of it from THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT .
So THE COURSE OF TIME 's THE COURSE OF TIME .
SOME were difficult to prosecute for A REASON OTHER THAN THE ULTIMATE DESIRE TO BRING A OFFENDER TO JUSTICE IN THESE LATE COMING TRIALS .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. would think that in THOSE DAYS there would have been a lot of debate about the advantages and disadvantages .
There would have been HIGHER POLICY QUESTIONS ABOUT PROSECUTING BECAUSE IN 1963 AND 64 -- BEAR IN MIND , HIGHER POLICY QUESTIONS ABOUT PROSECUTING BECAUSE IN 1963 AND 64 -- BEAR IN MIND , 1963 was when the stand in the schoolhouse door was .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. mean the University of Alabama was n't even integrated in 1963 .
THE END OF THE WORLD , THAT LIFE WOULD GO ON were very , very , very hot , difficult issues .
THOSE DAYS THE SUMMER OF '61 still existed .
If A CASE THAT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD had gone to trial in 1964 , regardless of the outcome , there would have been a likelihood of real disorder .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm just speculating .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. can think of a lot of reasons why .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. would think there would probably have been fear on THE PART OF THE WITNESSES to come forward .
As ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. understand THE PART OF THE WITNESSES there is evidence that is very compelling against all these defendants that to THIS DAY has n't been put on simply due to , even to THIS DAY , the reluctance and the fear of THE WITNESSES to testify .
There are A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. would defer to THE GI BILL assessment of A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS as opposed to mine , but ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. can think from scratch of A LOT OF GOOD REASONS why A LOT OF GOOD REASONS would n't have been prosecuted then .
What SOMEWHERE ELSE about THE TRIAL ? What question have n't WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON asked YOU about THE TRIAL ?
A VERY , VERY FINE QUESTION there is A VERY , VERY FINE QUESTION .
What kind of judge did WE have ? WE had JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON .
JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON was JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON .
As A YOUNG LAWYER ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. used to go by and talk to A YOUNG LAWYER .
A YOUNG LAWYER was very gruff , a great trial judge .
A YOUNG LAWYER gave US A GREAT TRIAL IN THAT CASE .
A YOUNG LAWYER blew a couple of calls that US appealed .
A GREAT TRIAL IN THAT CASE 's A GREAT TRIAL IN THAT CASE .
They were courageous calls and well made .
JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON told ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. ONE TIME , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess ONE TIME was after A GREAT TRIAL IN THAT CASE but before ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. became judge .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. went by JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON office and was visiting with JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON .
JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON was just sort of musing and being philosophical one afternoon .
JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON said , `` ART , YOU may want to do THIS JOB ONE DAY .
Let ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. tell YOU something .
They say that ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm mean , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess that ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. am , but ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. want YOU to know ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. did n't start out to be mean .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. started out to be nice .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. started out to be everybody 's friend , but TRIAL LAWYERS will make YOU mean .
If YOU take THIS JOB , do n't let TRIAL LAWYERS make YOU mean . ''
YOU 've got to get YOU wisdom where YOU find A PIECE OF WISDOM , and A PIECE OF WISDOM was A PIECE OF WISDOM that ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. took to heart .
Of course WE had had A GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN BIG NATIONAL TRIALS AND HUGE , CROWDED COURTROOMS so HUGE , CROWDED COURTROOMS was nothing new to WE , but A GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN BIG NATIONAL TRIALS AND HUGE , CROWDED COURTROOMS was A GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN BIG NATIONAL TRIALS AND HUGE , CROWDED COURTROOMS .
Then the idea of cameras , sound in the courtroom was totally alien to anything WE knew .
There was NO TV , no news reels , no nothing , and the courts were sacrosanct .
There was no entertainment or theater to them at all .
NO TV was very interesting .
We had NO OBJECTION TO IT , and THE WAY BILL did n't , THE GI BILL did n't and VIRTUE OF THE HONORIFIC CALL ME JUDGE on request , and over NO OBJECTION TO IT .
The wall behind A JURY LOOKING TOWARD AN ALL BLACK JURY IF WE COULD POSSIBLY GET IT , THINKING THAT IN THOSE DAYS THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IN MEMPHIS HAD AN UNREASONABLE FEAR OF REPERCUSSIONS IF THERE WERE NO CONVICTION AND WANTED TO CLOSE THE BOOK was lined with MICROPHONES THAT WERE HUNG FROM THE BALCONY .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know if YOU 've ever been in that big ceremonial courtroom ?
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON have .
They were hung from THE BALCONY .
YOU can see that JURY BOX in SPIKE LEE 'S movie , FOUR Little Girls .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think that JURY BOX made SPIKE LEE 'S MOVIE where ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. pointed out that JURY BOX to SPIKE LEE 'S , but behind JURY BOX there was a wall , and that wall was just matted with MICROPHONES THAT WERE HUNG FROM THE BALCONY from all over THE WORLD , THAT LIFE WOULD GO ON , NEWS PEOPLE hanging NEWS PEOPLE down to record the proceedings which was just radical for ONE DAY that JURY BOX would be allowed .
Were YOU involved in any way or knew THOSE PEOPLE ?
Why , sure .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. mean , bear in mind , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had THE THREE OF US great grand daddies rode off from THIS VALLEY before CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM was CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. grand daddy was THE ONLY GENERAL EVANGELIST THE NORTH ALABAMA METHODISTS EVER HAD .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had FIVE aunts who were prominent school principals .
One was president of the AEA .
MAYOR was MAYOR .
MAYOR was MAYOR and THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE .
MAYOR was MAYOR OF BIRMINGHAM .
MAYOR and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. were HE AND I here , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. spent THE NEXT NEARLY TWENTY YEARS as A CIRCUIT JUDGE .
So , in answer to YOU questions , `` Did ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. know anybody in Operation New Birmingham ? '' yeah , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. did .
Everybody ?
Yeah , pick a name .
OPERATION NEW BIRMINGHAM , YEAH , SURE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 've known EVERYBODY IN TOWN , if EVERYBODY IN TOWN 's possible in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM MY WHOLE LIFE , MY WHOLE LIFE .
Okay .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know where YOU 're leading ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. to .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm sorry .
Nothing , WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON 'm just thinking about -- .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. lived through THOSE DAYS .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. knew Al Lingo when AL LINGO -- ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess YOU 've run across AL LINGO name ?
UM-HUM .
Sure .
When AL LINGO was here AL LINGO had AL LINGO command headquarters during the disorder here in THE ST. FRANCIS HOTEL , ST. FRANCIS HOTEL .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. went over there .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. argued to the state supreme court when ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. before they even had third year cards .
When YOU were a young man of THE WAY THOSE THINGS WORKED EVEN IN BIRMINGHAM , AND CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH IN THOSE DAYS , and YOU knew THOSE PEOPLE , THE WAY THOSE THINGS WORKED EVEN IN BIRMINGHAM , AND CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH IN THOSE DAYS 's THE WAY THOSE THINGS WORKED EVEN IN BIRMINGHAM , AND CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH IN THOSE DAYS .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. would carry messages .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was twenty-one .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was in college , but ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. would carry messages for Governor JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON or ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad , whatever THE WAY THOSE THINGS WORKED EVEN IN BIRMINGHAM , AND CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH IN THOSE DAYS was .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. remember going in and COLONEL LINGO always looked like JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON stepped out of a band box .
JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON would lie up in one of those big double beds there at THE ST. FRANCIS HOTEL , and THE ST. FRANCIS HOTEL would be JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON command post .
As soon as JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON would get THERE COLONEL LINGO WOULD LIE IN THE BED IN HIS UNDER SHORTS , and JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON beautifully pressed uniform as soon as JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON came in would always be hanging on coat hangers so that THERE COLONEL LINGO WOULD LIE IN THE BED IN HIS UNDER SHORTS would stay crisp in case JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON had to go out .
JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON would sit there on JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON telephone and command operations in JUDGE WALLACE GIBSON under SHORTS .
When was that ?
Golly , THOSE YEARS run together .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know , when ? YOU 're the historian .
YOU would probably know better than I. Maybe 1962 , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess , possibly 61 , 62 MAYBE , 63 -- THOSE YEARS .
Okay .
Who else do YOU remember from THAT TIME ?
Everybody .
Everybody ? What about POOR OLD BULL CONNOR , POOR OLD ?
Yeah , POOR OLD BULL CONNOR , POOR OLD .
Poor POOR OLD BULL CONNOR , POOR OLD .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. say POOR OLD BULL CONNOR , POOR OLD MAYOR ! POP used to just agonize .
MAYOR 'd say , `` We could fix this , but nobody can do anything with Bull . ''
OLD BULL -- oh OLD BULL was probably a hundred years too young .
OLD BULL was just hard headed .
Bull was n't particularly bright .
OLD BULL was very hard headed .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad and JACK KENNEDY had a real affinity for each other .
MY DAD AND JACK KENNEDY were both PT boat skippers .
MY DAD AND JACK KENNEDY were within six months of THE SAME AGE , and MY DAD AND JACK KENNEDY had almost identically the same kind of charisma and style .
MY DAD AND JACK KENNEDY really did , although MY DAD AND JACK KENNEDY politics were divergent , nonetheless MY DAD AND JACK KENNEDY had A PERSONAL AFFINITY .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess A PERSONAL AFFINITY was 1961 .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad was still mayor .
A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC was not mayor in ' 63 .
ALBERT BOUTWELL was ALBERT BOUTWELL .
But ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad just agonized .
A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC wanted so desperately to keep the peace , and solve THE PROBLEMS , and get on about THE BUSINESS .
A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC thought AIR TRAVEL was THE KEY to AIR TRAVEL .
CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM and ATLANTA ATLANTA were about the same size , and A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC hope , CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM -- A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC was in great competition with the mayor of ATLANTA ATLANTA .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think BILL HARTSFIELD was BILL HARTSFIELD then .
They were HIS FRIENDS and competing very strongly for THE THINGS THAT MADE ATLANTA ATLANTA , THE THINGS THAT MADE ATLANTA ATLANTA .
In fact , CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM was running ahead .
Geographically CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM makes more sense to go to CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM than to ATLANTA FOR THE AIRLINES , and CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT was just killing CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM , just killing us .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad was so agonized over CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM , and A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC was also so very worried about THE SUMMER OF '61 in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM .
A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC talked to MAYOR about CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know if THE SUMMER OF '61 was THE SUMMER OF '61 or ' 62 MAYBE , but A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC asked MAYOR if they could make peace , and A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC suggested that THE SUMMER OF '61 to integrate THE GOLF COURSES .
HIS REASONING was that knowing THE PEOPLE OF BIRMINGHAM that THE PEOPLE OF BIRMINGHAM would literally die , that there would be tremendous unrest if YOU forced CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM on the children , boom , from scratch .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm talking about integration .
HIS REASONING 's impossible to explain to anybody who did n't live through THAT PERIOD OF HISTORY what HIS REASONING meant .
In THIS AREA THIS AREA was very , very dramatic .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad proposed to take THE GOLF COURSES , the adult facilities , integrate THE END OF THE WORLD , THAT LIFE WOULD GO ON THE SUMMER OF '61 , and then the adults would realize that THE END OF THE WORLD , THAT LIFE WOULD GO ON was n't THE END OF THE WORLD , THAT LIFE WOULD GO ON , and then the next summer MY DAD PROPOSED TO TAKE THE GOLF COURSES , THE ADULT FACILITIES could give the swimming pools .
MAYOR told MAYOR that MAYOR could n't do THE GOLF COURSES .
MAYOR brother BOB CHAMBLISS ' , and MARTIN LUTHER KING , and HIS BROTHER BOBBY , HIS BROTHER BOBBY , AND MARTIN LUTHER KING , AND HE needed AN EXAMPLE .
HIS BROTHER BOBBY , AND MARTIN LUTHER KING , AND HE had the Civil Rights Act .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess THE GOLF COURSES was THE GOLF COURSES .
At any rate , HIS BROTHER BOBBY , AND MARTIN LUTHER KING , AND HE had legislation HIS BROTHER BOBBY , AND MARTIN LUTHER KING , AND HE were interested in .
MAYOR told MAYOR that `` WE need AN EXAMPLE .
WE need a symbol , and CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM has got to be CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM because POOR OLD BULL CONNOR , POOR OLD is so intractable .
MAYOR , YOU can not make peace , '' is what MAYOR told MAYOR .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON 've never heard that story .
NO , YOU have n't , because WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON does n't fit in with history .
At THIS JUNCTURE HISTORY DOES N'T ALLOW PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK THIS JUNCTURE HISTORY DOES N'T ALLOW PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK 's way through .
We 're talking about ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. daddy who , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess , history has on the wrong side , if YOU will , of THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK .
MAYOR is THE ONE WHO SPENT ALL OF HIS MONEY , sent ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. THE UNITED STATES .
THE ONE WHO SPENT ALL OF HIS MONEY gives YOU an example of what kind of thing YOU 're talking about .
History just has THE ONE WHO SPENT ALL OF HIS MONEY wrong .
This thing that won the Pulitzer LAST YEAR .
JUST HORRIBLE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm sure YOU 've read JUST HORRIBLE .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON have .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm sure YOU 've read JUST HORRIBLE .
That young lady , what kind of historian does SHE think SHE is ? What kind of historian does SHE think SHE is to come down here and write that purely from one side .
Senator Jim Simpson has THE TWO OF THEM fine sons here , THE TWO OF THEM fine lawyer sons , Henry a graduate of VANDERBILT and Jimmy a graduate of PRINCETON .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad has a son .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm not much , but ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. speak English , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. have SOME RECOLLECTION OF HISTORICAL FACTS , and HISTORICAL FACTS is true across the boards .
SHE pillories , as ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. understand SOME RECOLLECTION OF HISTORICAL FACTS , MR. SMYER WHO , IN THOSE DAYS , WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ISSUE .
SHE 's just wrong .
SHE did not see fit to interview anybody , anybody on the other side of THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK .
SHE talked to FRED SHUTTLESWORTH AND THE LIKE .
See , FRED SHUTTLESWORTH AND THE LIKE 's what history does .
FRED SHUTTLESWORTH AND THE LIKE 's what history does .
THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE makes that BOOK SCRIPTURAL , if YOU will , when BOOK SCRIPTURAL is wrong in many instances and , at the very best , ill researched .
THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE 's just THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE .
THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE 's just THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE .
BOOK SCRIPTURAL , IF YOU WILL , WHEN IT IS WRONG IN MANY INSTANCES AND , AT THE VERY BEST , ILL even has BOTH SIDES OF THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK wrong .
Oh , really ? How ?
Oh yeah .
MR. SMYER WHO , IN THOSE DAYS , WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ISSUE was for immediate integration .
Yeah .
Okay , go ahead .
THE PEOPLE OF GOOD will all knew THIS JUNCTURE HISTORY DOES N'T ALLOW PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK , THIS JUNCTURE HISTORY DOES N'T ALLOW PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK right , whether YOU 're talking morally , intellectually , politically or in any other respect , knew that the segregated system in THE SOUTH PACIFIC could not stand , and THE PEOPLE OF GOOD will all were trying to find a way to accomplish THIS JUNCTURE HISTORY DOES N'T ALLOW PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK without civil unrest .
The idea in retrospect that YOU could -- look at IRAQ right now .
Look at IRAQ right now .
YOU do away with AN EXTREME EXAMPLE , and AN EXTREME EXAMPLE 's AN EXTREME EXAMPLE , but AN EXTREME EXAMPLE 's AN EXTREME EXAMPLE .
A COMPLETE SOCIAL CHANGE , A COMPLETE SOCIAL CHANGE requires a certain amount of thought .
YOU ca n't just get rid of THE LEADERSHIP , WHERE THE PEOPLE MY AGE and say , `` Now YOU people in Baghdad go about YOU business . ''
YOU have looting , and rioting , and THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm not making that analogy more than THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE is , but THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE 's THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE , a massive societal change is what YOU were dealing with .
THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE took thought and differing approaches to THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE .
There were some people like POOR OLD BULL CONNOR , POOR OLD .
THE KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE could n't happen .
A PERSON OF GOOD WILL would fall in a category with the J. B. Stoners , and THE ASA CARTERS , AND ED FIELDS , and THE ASA CARTERS , AND ED FIELDS .
Of course , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. view of all of that is that YOU 're talking maybe within A RADICAL CHANGE , and A RADICAL CHANGE was A RADICAL CHANGE , and A RADICAL CHANGE is A RADICAL CHANGE .
It seems to ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. that as long as THOSE PEOPLE are making A LIVING and gaining attention on THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK that A LIVING will remain an issue .
Morris Dees in MONTGOMERY is A GOOD EXAMPLE .
Reverend Jesse Jackson is A GOOD EXAMPLE .
As long as there is A LIVING TO BE MADE OF FIGHTING A FIGHT , OSTENSIBLY ON BOTH SIDES , THEN there will be THE PEOPLE .
Until we get to A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW where THE LEADERSHIP , WHERE THE PEOPLE MY AGE are gone , PART OF MY LIFE was n't PART OF MY LIFE really .
What THE PEOPLE call THE `` N '' WORD NOW AS NEVER ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE , FOR INSTANCE .
THE `` N '' WORD NOW AS NEVER ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE , FOR INSTANCE was THE `` N '' WORD NOW AS NEVER ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE , FOR INSTANCE .
THE `` N '' WORD NOW AS NEVER ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE , FOR INSTANCE was not allowed .
But other than THE `` N '' WORD NOW AS NEVER ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE , FOR INSTANCE , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. just went about THE BUSINESS .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. just did n't think about THE `` N '' WORD NOW AS NEVER ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE , FOR INSTANCE .
THE `` N '' WORD NOW AS NEVER ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE , FOR INSTANCE just was n't PART OF MY LIFE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think , however , if ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. were THE SAME AGE and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had been segregated until ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was twenty-two years old ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. doubt that ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. would forget THE SAME AGE .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. have A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT , and HIS FRIENDS have a lot of equanimity , but A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT 's A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT .
A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT 's A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think we 've got to have the generations who remember MY OPINION OF IT completely is MY OPINION OF IT .
MY OPINION OF IT was MY OPINION OF IT .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 've forgotten what YOU asked .
NO , WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON think NO 's great .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON think WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON started YOU off on OPERATION NEW BIRMINGHAM , YEAH , SURE .
YOU did n't start ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. off .
YOU said THE `` N '' WORD NOW AS NEVER ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE , FOR INSTANCE .
YOU asked ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. if ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. knew anybody .
Well , what about GEORGE SEIBELS ? WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON 've been doing some research on GEORGE SEIBELS .
Sure , sure .
A NEAT GUY was A NEAT GUY .
A NEAT GUY tried desperately to get ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. to go to Virginia when ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. started college .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. loved A NEAT GUY , and A NEAT GUY was active , gosh , until A NEAT GUY died , way late .
A very vigorous , active man .
A neat guy .
THE MOMENT I graduated from INTEGRATED PRINCETON UNIVERSITY , do YOU know what ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was doing when they called YOUR NAME on Cannon Green ?
What ?
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was sitting under a shade tree in Avondale eating a sandwich with THE TWO OF THEM guys .
THE THREE OF US were running behind A CITY OF BIRMINGHAM GARBAGE TRUCK .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. THE SUMMER OF '61 between PRINCETON and LAW SCHOOL .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad always exercised all of his considerable influence and connections to not only get ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. A SUMMER JOB THAT STARTED -- I 'D GET OFF THE RED-EYE FLIGHT AT FOUR IN THE MORNING , AND WOULD ALWAYS START TO WORK AT SIX-THIRTY THAT SAME MORNING , and SAME MORNING was SAME MORNING .
But A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC would always exercise A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC influence and get ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. the dirtiest , hardest , LOWEST PAYING JOB IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM , LOWEST PAYING JOB IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM .
THE SUMMER OF '61 GEORGE SEIBELS was , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think , president of THE CITY COUNCIL .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't think GEORGE SEIBELS was mayor yet .
GEORGE SEIBELS may have been mayor .
GEORGE SEIBELS has a very nice home there right on A LITTLE EDGE OF THE SOFA , right off Montevallo Road .
THAT EARLY MORNING was THAT EARLY MORNING , and GEORGE SEIBELS 's got A LITTLE HILL maybe THE TWO OF THEM feet high leading up to GEORGE SEIBELS curb .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. and the crew were getting A NEAT GUY garbage and putting THE MAYOR 'S GARBAGE in THE BACK OF THE TRUCK .
OUT OF THE MISTY DAWN OF THAT EARLY MORNING appeared AN APPARITION from THE LIP OF THE LITTLE HILL , and OUT OF THE MISTY DAWN OF THAT EARLY MORNING was THE MAYOR IN HIS BATHROBE out to get THE MAYOR IN HIS BATHROBE newspaper .
The night before ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. had been talking .
THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK was , of course , aviation .
THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK had always been something A PT BOAT SKIPPER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC was interested in for A CITY OF BIRMINGHAM GARBAGE TRUCK .
The day or THE TWO OF THEM before THE CITY COUNCIL had passed an increase in OF THE -- ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 've forgotten which THE TWO OF THEM was .
OF THE 'd either passed AN INCREASE in the gasoline fuel tax in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM as OPPOSED TO AN INCREASE IN THE LANDING FEES .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad thought OF THE should have done AN INCREASE the other way around because THE AIRLINES could avoid AN INCREASE by gassing up in ATLANTA ATLANTA or SOMEWHERE ELSE .
HE AND I had been talking about the increase in the millage on the gasoline as OPPOSED TO AN INCREASE IN THE LANDING FEES and the philosophy .
YOU know how YOU talk to YOU dad about miscellaneous things .
At any rate , AN APPARITION appears out of the mist in YOUR DAD ABOUT MISCELLANEOUS THINGS red silk bathrobe , and YOUR DAD ABOUT MISCELLANEOUS THINGS pajamas , and YOUR DAD ABOUT MISCELLANEOUS THINGS leather slides , and YOUR DAD ABOUT MISCELLANEOUS THINGS raised YOUR DAD ABOUT MISCELLANEOUS THINGS arms as IF IN A DOUBLE BENEDICTION , AND SAID , `` GOOD MORNING BOYS , '' in that wonderful , stentorian Virginian accent of YOUR DAD ABOUT MISCELLANEOUS THINGS .
`` Good morning IF IN A DOUBLE BENEDICTION , AND SAID , `` GOOD MORNING BOYS .
Good morning .
Do any of YOU have any questions about YOU city government ? '' We 're back there emptying THE MAYOR 'S GARBAGE into THE BACK OF THE TRUCK .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. very timidly raised ONE HAND , just as innocent as YOU can be .
HE said , `` Yes , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. boy . ''
HE did n't recognize ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. because in THE FIRST PLACE THE FIRST PLACE was misty , and in the second place ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. was covered with garbage .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. said , `` Yes , sir , mayor .
Can YOU explain to ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. why YOU increased the mileage on the gasoline as OPPOSED TO AN INCREASE IN THE LANDING FEES -- '' for several reasons we 'd talked about .
BECAUSE looked down .
BECAUSE looked like BECAUSE 'd been hit with a wet fish , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. realized in A FLASH that A FLASH must have gone through BECAUSE mind , `` Who on earth is hiring these garbage men ? '' BECAUSE response was , `` Bless YOU IF IN A DOUBLE BENEDICTION , AND SAID , `` GOOD MORNING BOYS , '' and BECAUSE spun on BECAUSE heels and went back in THEIR HOUSE .
But GEORGE SEIBELS was one of the people of good will that ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. 'm talking about .
Well , WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON know GEORGE SEIBELS did A LOT OF WORK on reforming the police department .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON did .
WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON do n't know if YOU can speak to A LOT OF WORK or not , reforming SOME FINAL THINGS .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know maybe the details .
EVERYBODY THAT COMES THROUGH CITY GOVERNMENT , of course , does some things .
BEAR in mind , we changed THE FORM OF CITY GOVERNMENT from the commission form to the mayor/council form in '62 , '62 or ' 63 ? BEAR 's where ALBERT BOUTWELL came from , and that resulted in a radical , radical change in the way government was operated in the whole construction of A CITY OF BIRMINGHAM GARBAGE TRUCK .
So to SOME EXTENT , all of those developments then GEORGE SEIBELS , and ALBERT BOUTWELL , and THE FIRST COUNCIL , WHAT , '62 were having to restructure all the city government .
Yeah , there would have been reforms then , but SOME EXTENT would have been by necessity because before THE MAYOR/COUNCIL formed in a commission form , each commissioner has THE MAYOR/COUNCIL own departments , or HIS OWN DEPARTMENTS .
SOME EXTENT would have been THE MAYOR/COUNCIL own departments then .
Now it could be THE MAYOR/COUNCIL or EVERYBODY THAT COMES THROUGH CITY GOVERNMENT own departments .
THAT COMMISSIONER 'S has THAT COMMISSIONER 'S departments , and they are responsible for THAT COMMISSIONER 'S DEPARTMENTS , and the commission as a whole really had somewhat limited powers .
THAT COMMISSIONER 'S DEPARTMENTS 's why Bull Connor as POLICE COMMISSIONER was almost unbridled in what POLICE COMMISSIONER could do in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM .
THAT COMMISSIONER 'S DEPARTMENTS is , in part , why ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad was frustrated because nobody could do anything with OLD BULL , and that , in large measure , is what lead to THE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF CITY GOVERNMENT .
So THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION , `` Do ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. know any of the details of the change of LOCAL POLICE , '' ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. guess ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. have known , but THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION does n't really matter because all of those developments and changes in THAT PERIOD OF HISTORY would be responsive to THE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF CITY GOVERNMENT as opposed to any real reformist movement in A CITY OF BIRMINGHAM GARBAGE TRUCK .
What about DAVID VANN ? WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON guess DAVID VANN 's DAVID VANN .
Yeah , DAVID VANN was DAVID VANN .
DAVID VANN and DAVID VANN partners , VERNON PATRICK and Erskin Smith , were PART OF THE EARLY GROUP THAT SAW THE CHANGE OF FORM OF GOVERNMENT .
All good young lawyers then were PART OF THE EARLY GROUP THAT SAW THE CHANGE OF FORM OF GOVERNMENT and instrumental in PART OF THE EARLY GROUP THAT SAW THE CHANGE OF FORM OF GOVERNMENT , and had figured out that the only way to get rid of POOR OLD BULL CONNOR , POOR OLD and that kind of approach to policing in CONTROLLING BIRMINGHAM was to change THE FORM OF CITY GOVERNMENT and put PART OF THE EARLY GROUP THAT SAW THE CHANGE OF FORM OF GOVERNMENT in the hands of THE FIRST COUNCIL .
DAVID VANN was DAVID VANN .
And interestingly , YOU know , we 're talking about history .
DAVID VANN and DAVID VANN friends were DAVID VANN AND HIS FRIENDS .
MAYOR was MAYOR that THAT TIME was going on .
Then and up until MAYOR death DAVID VANN , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. dad , and ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. always remained very good friends .
THAT IDEA THAT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WOULD SEGUE INTO PERSONAL DIFFERENCES -- I GUESS MAYBE IT 'S A LAWYER FRAME OF MIND , OR AT LEAST WAS THEN -- THAT YOU COULD HAVE HONESTLY HELD DISAGREEMENTS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES AND STILL have a lot of admiration and respect for each other as a person .
THAT IDEA THAT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WOULD SEGUE INTO PERSONAL DIFFERENCES -- I GUESS MAYBE IT 'S A LAWYER FRAME OF MIND , OR AT LEAST WAS THEN -- THAT YOU COULD HAVE HONESTLY HELD DISAGREEMENTS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES AND STILL 's THAT IDEA THAT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WOULD SEGUE INTO PERSONAL DIFFERENCES -- I GUESS MAYBE IT 'S A LAWYER FRAME OF MIND , OR AT LEAST WAS THEN -- THAT YOU COULD HAVE HONESTLY HELD DISAGREEMENTS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES AND STILL .
DAVID VANN was DAVID VANN , and a very , very astute student of government and HIS TELEPHONE AND COMMAND OPERATIONS IN HIS .
GREAT .
So just a few last things .
What about THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE ? WILLOUGHBY ANDERSON know DAVID VANN was instrumental in THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE and also RICHARD ARRINGTON .
THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE , ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. do n't know what YOU question is .
What about THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE ? Is THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE ?
Sure .
Sure .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think that THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE is THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE because THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE 's THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE , and what is a museum for ? THE CIVIL RIGHTS INSTITUTE 's to preserve history .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. believe that WE must make THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HISTORY RATHER THAN CURRENT EVENTS to lay THAT ISSUE TO BE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL AND PEOPLE OF A MIND TO MAKE PEACE AND TO LET HISTORY WORK to rest .
ARTHUR J. HANES , JR. think THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HISTORY RATHER THAN CURRENT EVENTS 's important that WE lay THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HISTORY RATHER THAN CURRENT EVENTS to rest .
Just as THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR Between THE UNITED STATES has become THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HISTORY RATHER THAN CURRENT EVENTS .
