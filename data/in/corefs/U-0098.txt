All of our organizers had THE LAST PART .
Okay .
In OTHER WORDS , the organizer became the director or whatever .
Actually when THE FUNDING started phasing out on VOTER WORK , VOTER WORK 's when TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE became associate director of THE CAROLINA COMMUNITY PROJECT .
Did TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do THAT RIGHT ? THAT RIGHT 's not right on YOU paper TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't think .

TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE started out as an organizer .

There was only one year doing the other work .

CATHY HOWELL was originally , when TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE came on , CATHY HOWELL was THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR , and JOHN WANCHECK was THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR .
Then CATHY HOWELL left to do something else and A FEW YEARS means JOHN WANCHECK became THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR and CATHY HOWELL pulled TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE in as associate director .

So how long were YOU DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR for THE RURAL ADVANCEMENT FUND , THE WHOLE THING .
THE RURAL ADVANCEMENT FUND , THE WHOLE THING was before RON CHARITY died .
THAT WAS -
From ' 91 , THAT 'S FOR SIX .
RON CHARITY died in ' 91 , THAT 'S FOR SIX .

After RON -LSB- passed away .
RON -LSB- intended for TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE to be THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR .
But instead TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE went in , worked MEL 'S campaign , and it was sort of hard because YOU saw THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE BEFORE-TO BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE AGAIN ALONG WITH OTHERS OF HIGHER INCOME names on , the other organizer 's names on THE LIST FOR WHATEVER .

HIS DEATH was just really hard .

WE board selected , but WE had n't gotten , WE did some work voluntarily beforehand , but WE had n't gotten , WE were n't in full mode until WE got some funding in .

So have YOU been working for CONGRESSMAN MEL WATT FOR THIS CELEBRATION , CONGRESSMAN MEL WATT FOR THIS CELEBRATION , Congressman Watt since 1992 ?

WE did n't call THE POSITION -RSB- an executive director .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was THE POSITION -RSB- MVC COORDINATOR .
So now YOU 're advisor .
Now TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm -LSB- in -RSB- AN ADVISORY ROLE .
Okay , A CHALLENGE OF INTERVIEWING YOU IS YOU have such wide-ranging experiences .
A CHALLENGE OF INTERVIEWING YOU IS YOU 's tough to know exactly what to focus on .
Do YOU want to know about JIM PIERCE now or do YOU want -
Yeah , why do n't YOU talk about JIM PIERCE and -
JIM PIERCE was hilarious .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE consider JIM PIERCE ANOTHER MENTOR .
But JIM PIERCE came , well , actually there were some questions about THE RURAL ADVANCEMENT FUND , THE WHOLE THING .
The executive director in 1996 sort of , they ended with CHARLOTTE ORGANIZING PROJECT , and there were still some questions .
THE SOUTH AFRICA PROJECT .
RUBY , R-U-B-Y .
RURAL ADVANCEMENT FUND .
Oh NO , NO , NO , SWEETHEART ended -
THE RURAL ADVANCEMENT FUND , THE WHOLE THING ended some time , but NO , NO , NO , SWEETHEART were still doing the final paperwork in 1996 .
YOU hear what TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm saying .
NO , NO , NO , SWEETHEART were trying to finish up .
There was some equipment and furniture that was housed in THIS BUILDING .
JIM PIERCE owned THIS BUILDING .
JIM PIERCE was primarily doing real estate at THE TIME WHEN I MET HIM .
But A LABOR ORGANIZER was A LABOR ORGANIZER .
A LABOR ORGANIZER had not done THE VOTER PARTICIPATION in THIS AREA ANYWAY PRIOR TO THAT .
A LABOR ORGANIZER was A LABOR ORGANIZER .
When TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE met A LABOR ORGANIZER , A LABOR ORGANIZER was doing real estate .
The building where THE RURAL ADVANCEMENT FUND , THE WHOLE THING was located - .
-LSB- There -RSB- was still SOME OLD EQUIPMENT .
There were still some questions about paperwork and everything .
So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was called in to see if TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE knew anything because THEY could n't get THEY hands on anyone else .
SOME OLD EQUIPMENT was SOME OLD EQUIPMENT that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE had met JIM PIERCE .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE had heard a lot about JIM PIERCE .
JIM PIERCE was almost like a legend before .
Where TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE went to get MY INITIAL ORGANIZING TRAINING was called THE GRAHAM CENTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA , and CATHY HOWELL rented THE GRAHAM CENTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA to do OUR organizing training .
It was A FULL COMPLEX WHERE WE COULD STAY OVERNIGHT .
A FULL COMPLEX WHERE WE COULD STAY OVERNIGHT used to be like a farm area .
JIM PIERCE owned A FULL COMPLEX WHERE WE COULD STAY OVERNIGHT , and then JIM PIERCE set A FULL COMPLEX WHERE WE COULD STAY OVERNIGHT up for ORGANIZERS WHAT WE DO to come in and do workshops and THE THINGS THAT .
So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE had heard about JIM PIERCE before , and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE had heard that JIM PIERCE was JIM PIERCE .
So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE finally had a chance to meet JIM PIERCE , and WE talked and went from one thing to another .
By JIM PIERCE doing labor organizing , a lot of A LOT OF THE SKILLS , A LOT OF THE SKILLS overlap into THE VOTER PARTICIPATION , and WE each saw how WE could complement each other .
WE had a good labor component in THE MECKLENBURG VOTER COALITION YOU SAID '84 TO PRESENT prior to JIM PIERCE coming along with JIM LAWRENCE with A. PHILIP RANDOLPH INSTITUTE and James Andrews of AFL-CIO .
There was the Central Labor Council with Kyle Spencer and THE WILSON , Bill Brawley representing the firefighters union .
So WE had those contacts prior to JIM PIERCE , but what TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think JIM PIERCE brought to the table was JIM PIERCE experience in labor organizing and expanding the unions that actually participated with WE to SOME TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'd never heard of including the pilots union and the attendants , flight attendants .
SOME were all doing -LSB- VOTER REGISTRATION there as a part of WE coalition .
The food workers , so WE had quite a few people TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think at THAT POINT .
WE were rather quiet in WE operation .
WE just wanted to simply help PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME get to THE POLLS THAT NEEDED TO .
WE wanted to make sure that PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME knew what PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME were doing when PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME voted .
WE were all about doing the trainings with OTHER ORGANIZATIONS if OTHER ORGANIZATIONS wanted to do THE VOTER PARTICIPATION .
WE did the canvassing , every facet , every facet of get out to vote just about .
So when JIM PIERCE came along , JIM PIERCE says , WE may as well let some other people know what WE 're doing .
WE used to work in THE OFFICES that YOU say too much then YOU 'll have people working against YOU too .
JIM PIERCE says , what THE HECK . .
What THE HECK .
JIM PIERCE says THE HECK . 's just going to be a battle down to the wire anyway .
So WE may as well , if YOU keep THE HECK . like THE HECK . is , the electorate wo n't know that YOU services are available .
So WE 's when WE just sort of opened THE HECK . up to the whole community .
But JIM PIERCE had A HUGE INFLUENCE .
JIM PIERCE had A HUGE INFLUENCE and JIM PIERCE was super .
JIM PIERCE was just JIM PIERCE .
So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't know if YOU want TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE to get into one or not but -
Yeah , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT think WE 're

Well , RON -LSB- had been -RSB- doing organizing since THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
RON -LSB- was doing THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLITICAL ORGANIZING .
RON -LSB- wife was an attorney , and AN ORGANIZER IN HER OWN RIGHT was also AN ORGANIZER IN HER OWN RIGHT .
They worked in RURAL VIRGINIA helping PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME .
AN ORGANIZER IN HER OWN RIGHT did -LSB- THE THINGS THAT ? -RSB- A LITTLE differently from RON -LSB- .
RON -LSB- would actually run campaign , and RON -LSB- really helped to organize RURAL VIRGINIA and some of the other groups around the southeast .
RON -LSB- was RON -LSB- also .
RON -LSB- also worked with a lot of THE FARMER 'S groups .
One of the things TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE could appreciate is before actually working on a candidate 's campaign , a candidate running for office , do YOU remember , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't know .
YOU probably do n't remember , the old , -LSB- there -RSB- were AGRICULTURAL GROUPS in - .
A lot of AGRICULTURAL GROUPS in THIS AREA ANYWAY PRIOR TO THAT and THE SOUTH AFRICA PROJECT . and GEORGIA .
THE FARMER 'S Home Administration was one of them .
THE FARMER 'S would run for THE OFFICES , these farmers and different people in the various locales would actually run for THE OFFICES .
THE FARMER 'S Home Administration in PARTICULAR was lily white .
But yet THE FARMER 'S HOME ADMINISTRATION IN PARTICULAR policies impacted all farmers .
So THESE WERE GOVERNMENTAL -
GOVERNMENTAL and local groups that had gotten together to try to influence farm issues .
Okay .
So what THESE WERE GOVERNMENTAL - did was THESE WERE GOVERNMENTAL - worked with FARMERS WHO WANTED TO BECOME OFFICERS , wanted to become elected officers , but THESE WERE GOVERNMENTAL - taught FARMERS WHO WANTED TO BECOME OFFICERS to actually run campaigns .
So GOVERNMENTAL ended up being A LOT more SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS and Native Americans onto THOSE BOARDS .
Right .
So GOVERNMENTAL was from - .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE initial training in work down in Robeson County , CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT was where - .
And over in what 's THE NAME OF THE PLACE OVER IN NORTHEAST North Carolina as well .
Because ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT know that the rural farmers that with AN IDEA TO ELEVATING THEIR CLASS STATUS .
Yeah .
AN IDEA TO ELEVATING THEIR CLASS STATUS was AN IDEA TO ELEVATING THEIR CLASS STATUS .
AN IDEA TO ELEVATING THEIR CLASS STATUS was another whole project .
Land loss .
There is a land loss project , and THE CAROLINA COMMUNITY PROJECT actually offered assistance to THOSE FOLKS in developing THAT ISSUE AND WORKING .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE did n't do A LOT with A LOT , but as a part of THE FARM WORK , that was ONE COMPONENT that THOSE FOLKS talked ABOUT HERE TOO .
Did YOU feel that YOU were able to make like an impact on elevating THOSE FOLKS economic status at all ?
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE would say as ORGANIZERS WHAT WE DO , as direct action organizers WE are actually given THE TOOLS WORKING WITH THEM TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO WORK THROUGH THE SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO AN ADVOCACY GROUP .
YOU know what TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean .
Just get all service group that 's actually giving ORGANIZERS WHAT WE DO -
Right , because YOU were saying the technical assistance is what YOU can .
So if ORGANIZERS WHAT WE DO can run THEIR OWN ISSUES , ISSUE CAMPAIGNS and work through THE SYSTEM , knowing who makes the decisions , who holds THAT KIND OF THING , THAT KIND OF THING .
Did YOU see that -
ORGANIZERS WHAT WE DO was more , yes , that was definitely -LSB- where WE saw the impact of WE work -RSB- a long way because ORGANIZERS WHAT WE DO would n't see any other outlet or for COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND PUBLIC POLICY or whatever .
Why do n't ORGANIZERS WHAT WE DO other materials that YOU said YOU gathered from - ?
Let TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE finish this about RON CHARITY .
Okay , so RON CHARITY came to work for SI KAHN AT GRASSROOTS LEADERSHIP .
So SI KAHN AT GRASSROOTS LEADERSHIP 's -LSB- when TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE -RSB- really got to work with RON CHARITY , and RON CHARITY became like ANOTHER MENTOR , and SI KAHN AT GRASSROOTS LEADERSHIP 's when TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE started learning THE POLITICAL ORGANIZING , WHICH IS A GOOD BIT DIFFERENT FROM COMMUNITY ORGANIZING .
And then KENT STATE after SI KAHN AT GRASSROOTS LEADERSHIP .
Everything else is now .
Sure .
If YOU could talk JUST A LITTLE BIT about THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLITICAL ORGANIZING .
THE BASIC DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE : MOST OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING ISSUES are THE BASIC DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE : MOST OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING ISSUES , THE BASIC DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE : MOST OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING ISSUES .
THE POLITICAL ORGANIZING , WHICH IS A GOOD BIT DIFFERENT FROM COMMUNITY ORGANIZING , if YOU 're doing nonpartisan political organizing , YOU have a finite time frame to work from : say , -LSB- OH THE primary through that election to do YOU voter education issues .
Working with THOSE TARGETED AREAS CONSTANTLY UNTIL TIME TO GET OUT THE VOTE .
YOU do n't go any further and VOTER EDUCATION YOU CA N'T - .
YOU can tell THOSE TARGETED AREAS CONSTANTLY UNTIL TIME TO GET OUT THE VOTE who all the candidates are , but YOU ca n't say vote for a specific candidate or anything like THOSE TARGETED AREAS CONSTANTLY UNTIL TIME TO GET OUT THE VOTE .
But it was , VOTER EDUCATION YOU CA N'T made a huge difference , PEOPLE WERE A LOT MORE INFORMED .
When PEOPLE WERE A LOT MORE INFORMED went to THE POLLS THAT NEEDED TO , PEOPLE WERE A LOT MORE INFORMED could choose for PEOPLE WERE A LOT MORE INFORMED if PEOPLE WERE A LOT MORE INFORMED knew how to get information .
So with THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING ISSUES , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean the only thing TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE can think of THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING ISSUES 's really , really short THE BASIC DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE : MOST OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING ISSUES , for instance if there was a neighborhood that had a very , very busy intersection .
A SHORT-TERM KIND OF THING it was hard for PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME to get stop signs and stop lights in particular because in THIS AREA ANYWAY PRIOR TO THAT there had to be at least THESE FIVE fatalities before PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME would put a light up in some areas .
So A SHORT-TERM KIND OF THING was critical and to teach PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME - .
A SHORT-TERM KIND OF THING was like teaching PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME to work through THE SYSTEM .
Thus A SHORT-TERM KIND OF THING 's kind of , A SHORT-TERM KIND OF THING could be A SHORT-TERM KIND OF THING .
But when YOU 're talking about landlord/tenant issues , -LSB- YOU -RSB- are also with trying to figure out who the allies are and who are the targets , who are YOU actually going after .
Sometimes A SHORT-TERM KIND OF THING takes A LOT more behind the scenes work , and A SHORT-TERM KIND OF THING 's like THAT ISSUE AND WORKING is , THAT ISSUE AND WORKING does n't have a finite time .
There may be more appropriate WELL BOTH TIMES than OTHERS to really quicken THE PACE TO GET SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT .
But THE PACE TO GET SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT 's not like doing THE VOTER PARTICIPATION at all .
THE PACE TO GET SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT 's over and done .
Actually -LSB- VOTER REGISTRATION ? A GOOD SHORT -LSB- ACTIVITY ? -RSB- is A GOOD SHORT -LSB- ACTIVITY ? -RSB- to start with when YOU 're building a new group because OTHERS can see success almost immediately , and OTHERS will give OTHERS the strength and courage to go on and do something more long term .
What are SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING ?
Around HERE HERE was like well , this strictly in terms of a lot of GROUPS THAT WANT TO PROTEST but primarily seniors .
CHOP took on the utility increases .
SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING were for A WHILE WITH DUKE POWER .
still goes on today , but -LSB- there is -RSB- not a lot of mention of -LSB- A WHILE WITH DUKE POWER -RSB- is A WHILE WITH DUKE POWER .
SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING had what SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING call the Community Reinvestment Alliance going on .
As A MATTER OF FACT A POLICEMAN IN WASHINGTON was chair of THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS AS A CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON CONGRESSMAN WATT COMMISSIONED ME TO HELP CHARLOTTE GET AN ACTIVE SISTER CITY , and THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS AS A CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON CONGRESSMAN WATT COMMISSIONED ME TO HELP CHARLOTTE GET AN ACTIVE SISTER CITY worked on THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING , and then the last set of THEIR OWN ISSUES were around landlord tenant rights that CHOP did here .
So THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PIECES PRIMARILY were THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PIECES PRIMARILY .
Over the late '70s , EARLY '80S .
EARLY '80S
EARLY '80S
LANDLORD TENANT was in THE '90S .
LANDLORD TENANT was in THE '90S .
So if YOU want to , is there anything else YOU wanted to say .
There were several other groups that we worked with including SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS , -LSB- TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE -RSB- was on THE COMMUNITY RELATIONS COMMITTEE .
Okay and -
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was on for THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
During EARLY '80S .
This was during EARLY '80S , yes .
Okay .
Because ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT 've heard about SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS but more in THE '60S but -
We have one that operates now and ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT help to mediate problems in the workplace and different - .
Or if there 's A , something going on say with a school matter or whatever A 's not being addressed or TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean A can take any form from GROUPS THAT WANT TO PROTEST .
In THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY YOU have to get a license to protest now .
If A GROUP 'S FEELING disenfranchised or WHATEVER , WHATEVER can go through THE COMMUNITY RELATIONS COMMITTEE .
So A GROUP 'S FEELING 's like a mediation sort of -
There 's ONE COMPONENT .
So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was on that committee for A WHILE .
There might be injustices that different individuals may have felt in dealing with THE POLICE DEPARTMENT and what not .
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 's been THE POLICE DEPARTMENT , but THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 's THE POLICE DEPARTMENT -
This is in EARLY '80S .
EARLY '80S
Then TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was on THE SISTER CITIES COMMITTEE .
Yeah , YOU mentioned that .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was actually on THE SISTER CITIES COMMITTEE , but prior to THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS AS A CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON CONGRESSMAN WATT COMMISSIONED ME TO HELP CHARLOTTE GET AN ACTIVE SISTER CITY .
THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY has one of the longest running , LARGEST SISTER CITIES programs in the nation .
But yet THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY , this is like 1985-1987 that we did THE FARM WORK .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm sorry '95 to ' 97 .
So THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY had FOUR EUROPEAN CITIES , one ASIA , one THE SOUTH AFRICA PROJECT . and not one African at all .
So MEL 'S said MEL 'S would like to make sure that AT LEAST EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THE DISTRICT had an African sister city .
Well , AT LEAST EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THE DISTRICT 's big .
AT LEAST EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THE DISTRICT was , but AT LEAST EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THE DISTRICT also started with THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY , and at THAT TIME THE DISTRICT ran from Gaston County to DURHAM .
DURHAM had had A SISTER CITY .
A SISTER CITY was A SISTER CITY .
Interesting .
A SISTER CITY seems so widespread .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE can tell YOU more about that later too .
Like TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE have THE CURRENT MAP , and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE can tell YOU how THE CURRENT MAP 's done .
So anyway , the primary work was done with THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
Did SOME with GREENSBORO and WINSTON-SALEM , some work with SOME .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm not sure .
SOME OF THE CITIES sort of came together to do SOME OF THE CITIES because SOME did n't have COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND PUBLIC POLICY to pull SOME OF THE CITIES off and do by SOME .
So SOME came together for A WHILE .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm not really sure how SOME 're set up now .
But WE still have THE ONE here in THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
So YOU set up LARGEST SISTER CITIES in A FREE SOUTH AFRICA with the other cities , THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY but also WINSTON-SALEM .
Okay , WE were trying to help SOME get-there 's a national sister cities program .
THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY has been THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
So has DURHAM .
WINSTON-SALEM got into WINSTON-SALEM and GREENSBORO .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't know if IT A LITTLE BIT AND GREENSBORO officially have sister cities now or not .
WINSTON-SALEM 's WINSTON-SALEM .
But going based on THE CHARLOTTE EXPERIENCE .
Yeah .
Okay , WE helped the local THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY sister cities pull -LSB- AS A walks of life , from academic , business , educ-high school , and since high school and college and CHURCHES and every facet of life , OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY .
WE pulled -LSB- AS A steering committee and said that WE wanted to have this type of relationship with a city in A FREE SOUTH AFRICA .
Under THE GUIDELINES YOU could only have one sister city in ONE COUNTRY .
So when WE started , there are THE SEVEN CRITERIA .
WE looked at ACCRA , Ghana THOSE FIRST , but Chicago had ACCRA .
THE SEVEN CRITERIA actually matches up FOUR EUROPEAN CITIES that they have a lot of things in common .
WE looked at KUMASEI , ACCRA , GHANA , which was THE OLD CAPITAL OF GHANA , and still had A KING .
ACCRA , GHANA had A KING and simultaneously A PRESIDENT OF A REPUBLIC , WHICH IS , THE KING IS SORT OF LIKE QUEEN ELIZABETH IN THAT SHE DID N'T HAVE ANY , A KING did n't have any official power but wielded a lot of influence .
So ACCRA , GHANA was ACCRA , GHANA too .
So WE got to meet with A KING .
WE celebrated THE CONSUMMATION OF THE SISTER CITY AGREEMENT during A KING twenty-fifth anniversary .
Oh WE 's perfect .
Oh THE CONSUMMATION OF THE SISTER CITY AGREEMENT was tremendous .
THE CONSUMMATION OF THE SISTER CITY AGREEMENT must 've been amazing .
THE CONSUMMATION OF THE SISTER CITY AGREEMENT was because royalty from all over A FREE SOUTH AFRICA and a lot of EUROPE came to pay homage to him .
Then Mayor Vinroot went along with US with CONGRESSMAN MEL WATT FOR THIS CELEBRATION .
A HUGE THING was A HUGE THING , and STEVE CRUMP FROM WBTV , STEVE CRUMP FROM WBTV 's STEVE CRUMP FROM WBTV .
STEVE CRUMP FROM WBTV and several crew members went with US and documented A HUGE THING .
There is a whole piece on A HUGE THING , and US got to visit with A PRESIDENT OF A REPUBLIC , WHICH IS , THE KING IS SORT OF LIKE QUEEN ELIZABETH IN THAT SHE DID N'T HAVE ANY .
A MATTER OF FACT A PRESIDENT OF A REPUBLIC , WHICH IS , THE KING IS SORT OF LIKE QUEEN ELIZABETH IN THAT SHE DID N'T HAVE ANY was responsible for US whole host there in terms of getting US from ACCRA to KUMASEI and whatever US did there .
US had , US went to visit A WHOLE STORY UNTO ITSELF there , had a real good meeting with HE AND SEVERAL CREW MEMBERS .
But TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't know how much US need to in depth there , but A WHOLE STORY UNTO ITSELF 's A WHOLE STORY UNTO ITSELF .
One of these days TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'd like to go back purely as a visitor and not working because US took FORTY people over there .
While YES , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was having fun and doing THE THINGS THAT , US were still responsible for FORTY people , and US had to do US job .
So YES was better and then after YES was over , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE became a member of a sister cities board , and US worked with THE OTHER COUNTRIES , THE OTHER COUNTRIES as well .
So there is ONE follow up THAT QUESTION .
What was the significance of THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS AS A CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON CONGRESSMAN WATT COMMISSIONED ME TO HELP CHARLOTTE GET AN ACTIVE SISTER CITY ? Why did THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS AS A CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON CONGRESSMAN WATT COMMISSIONED ME TO HELP CHARLOTTE GET AN ACTIVE SISTER CITY , why did THIS IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO HOLD A REALLY SPECIAL MEANING ?
Because for SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS , THIS IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO HOLD A REALLY SPECIAL MEANING do n't have A FULL CONNECTED HISTORY that THIS IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO HOLD A REALLY SPECIAL MEANING know of , and THIS IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO HOLD A REALLY SPECIAL MEANING did A FULL CONNECTED HISTORY for THIS IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO HOLD A REALLY SPECIAL MEANING .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE used to stand on THE SHORES OF MYRTLE BEACH and look as far as TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE could possibly see and wonder what MYRTLE BEACH was like on the other side .
When TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE got over there and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE got to go and THIS IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO HOLD A REALLY SPECIAL MEANING went to the slave castles , and there was the door of no return and how THIS IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO HOLD A REALLY SPECIAL MEANING forefathers were forced out into these waters .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'll show YOU SOME OF THE PICTURES IN THE HALLWAY when THIS IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO HOLD A REALLY SPECIAL MEANING go out .
SOME OF THE PICTURES IN THE HALLWAY was just amazing .
So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE stood on THE SHORES OF MYRTLE BEACH there and looked back here , and that completed THE PICTURE FOR ME .
THEY do A REENACTMENT there at the slave castles at Cape Coast .
THEY do A REENACTMENT .
A REENACTMENT meant , A REENACTMENT provided a lot of healing that WE did n't even know WE needed going through THE CHARLOTTE EXPERIENCE and trying to understand .
WE still do n't really understand , but WE know how A REENACTMENT happened and all WE .
So there were pieces of a story , of the puzzle that were being put together for WE .
So THIS was what was being felt by other African Americans on the trip .
And TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think that , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean , to know that YOU have such A FULL HISTORY is just , A FULL HISTORY 's amazing .
Just like okay , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was saying here in CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT THIS 're TEXTILES .
THIS do textile manufacturing .
Over THERE IN ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES OUT FROM KUMASEI , THERE IN ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES OUT FROM KUMASEI have just like THIS do .
In one of the , in one of the communities where THERE IN ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES OUT FROM KUMASEI originally made THE KENTE CLOTH , where ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES OUT FROM KUMASEI came from .
So THERE IN ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES OUT FROM KUMASEI 're like , THERE IN ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES OUT FROM KUMASEI do TEXTILES too .
Make OH THE , OH THE -
THE KENTE CLOTH .
Okay .
YOU may have seen , YOU saw in MY OFFICE ONE TYPE .
What A KING and A PRESIDENT OF A REPUBLIC , WHICH IS , THE KING IS SORT OF LIKE QUEEN ELIZABETH IN THAT SHE DID N'T HAVE ANY wore on special occasions is quadruply woven KENTE .
MY OFFICE ONE TYPE 's fantastic .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean MY OFFICE ONE TYPE 's thick .
MY OFFICE ONE TYPE 's brilliant , brilliant colors .
MY OFFICE ONE TYPE along with they have some unique woods from the forests .
WE do a lot of forestry around HERE and furniture making .
Okay in Charlotte WE have the mint museum .
THIS was where the THOSE FIRST gold rush occurred before California .
ACCRA , GHANA called THE GOLD COAST .
WE saw in THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC and how THIS would use the gold in ceremonies even until today .
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 's amazing .
THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 's THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC .
So WE work directly with THE SISTER CITIES COMMITTEE there , and WE brought THIS here and then THE SISTER CITIES COMMITTEE was WE chamber of commerce and the Bank of America and all to see the individuals that wanted to go into business , import-exporting .
From THEN ' 83 THIS have to kind of take THEN ' 83 upon THIS .
But WE could make THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC .
Make the connections with IN GRADUATE SCHOOL , with OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY , WE took thousands of dollars worth of medical supplies over .
WE made THREE trips total between 1985 and ' 87 .
'95 and ' 97 .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE keep saying that .
WE did an exploratory -LSB- trip -RSB- at THE END OF '84 TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean ' 94 , and then THE SISTER CITY AGREEMENT was cancelled in 1997 .
Well , THIS reminds THIS in MEMPHIS WHO WORKS WITH THE NAACP BRANCH THERE and AFRICAN AMERICAN was AFRICAN AMERICAN , and HE too had an opportunity to go to A FREE SOUTH AFRICA to ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT think Seychelles or some place like on THE GOLD COAST and -LSB- had -RSB- similar reactions to YOU .
HE was like when YOU go back there , YOU just realize how THE THINGS THAT happened and how ONE all started , and YOU have to go there to understand ONE .
And THE OTHER , one of the other amazing things , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm seeing THE THINGS THAT all along A WAY .
WE went to NEW YORK again on Ghana Airways .
WE wanted to support THEIR AIRLINE .
WE got on there , and THEIR AIRLINE was like an all-black crew .
The seats were made out OF-IT WAS A LIME COLOR , and OF-IT WAS A LIME COLOR had all these African designs in OF-IT WAS A LIME COLOR .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean for AN AFRICAN AMERICAN to see THIS was astonishing because WE 're used to seeing more mixed settings .
When WE -LSB- were -RSB- flying , THIS -LSB- was -RSB- not all white .
To see BLACKS in positions of power .
Position of power , speaking multiple languages .
Then when BLACKS get there , when BLACKS THOSE FIRST landed in SENEGAL , IVORY COAST , GHANA .
BLACKS were in SENEGAL , IVORY COAST , GHANA .
THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PIECES PRIMARILY were the stops that BLACKS had -
Okay .
To see PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME , and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't mean just , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm saying actual relatives that look like relatives .
THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PIECES PRIMARILY was amazing .
BLACKS could pick out aunts and uncles and cousins .
BLACKS 's how close THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PIECES PRIMARILY was .
YOU 'd think , SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS .
BLACKS have a lot of European , some Native American .
BLACKS have A LOT .
Whereas YOU think Africans , YOU would n't see those kinds of mixtures .
YOU see every color of the rainbow .
GHANA IN PARTICULAR is mixed because GHANA IN PARTICULAR was GHANA IN PARTICULAR .
GHANA IN PARTICULAR has one of the biggest markets in THE WORLD , OUTDOOR MARKETS .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean GHANA IN PARTICULAR 's like a maze trying to go - .
GHANA IN PARTICULAR was also GHANA IN PARTICULAR where all the educators came to be trained .
GHANA IN PARTICULAR 's , that goes into ancient history .
To see this stuff was just phenomenal .
So YOU had PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD at this crossroads .
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD even go back as far in archeology as far as the land masses being together for the Indian Ocean and all .
So YOU 're talking about migration from AFRICA OVER INTO ASIA AND THEN INTO EUROPE .
AFRICA OVER INTO ASIA AND THEN INTO EUROPE goes back that far .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean YOU had PEOPLE , ARCHEOLOGISTS AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS COME IN TO MAKE TALKS TO US WHILE WE WERE THERE .
Wow .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT know PEOPLE , ARCHEOLOGISTS AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS COME IN TO MAKE TALKS TO US WHILE WE WERE THERE have to move on for THE ONE .
Later ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT 'll have to mention something else .
Well , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT will right now .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT hope ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT supervisors do n't get mad .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT think this is very relevant actually .
But ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT interviewed JULIAN BOND .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT had met JULIAN BOND as a professor at American University , and one thing that we did n't go in depth about but JULIAN BOND told ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT about how , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT think THE OLD CAPITAL OF GHANA was THE OLD CAPITAL OF GHANA .
ACCRA .
ACCRA , well , ACCRA was -
ACCRA 's spelled , A-C-C-R-A .
Maybe ACCRA was n't ACCRA , GHANA , but anyway , he went to A FREE SOUTH AFRICA in THE '60S with Harry Belafonte , Fannie Lou Hamer and so forth and just talked about how THEY went there during THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
THEY met with the rulers of wherever THEY went and how ACCRA was just so-saying some of the similar things .
THEY will roll out the red carpet for YOU .
Yeah .
Yeah .
So did YOU feel when YOU went there that YOU have THIS EUROCENTRIC WHITE KIND OF DOMINATED CULTURE , well , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT mean obviously here THIS EUROCENTRIC WHITE KIND OF DOMINATED CULTURE 's still THIS EUROCENTRIC WHITE KIND OF DOMINATED CULTURE , and that YOU felt a validation there that YOU do n't , have n't received here .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean THE THINGS THAT are better , much better now .
But still , yes .
THE FACT THAT THERE 'S ALWAYS BEEN A HISTORY FOR THE SLAVES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY .
There was NO KNOWLEDGE because THE SLAVES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY went on oral histories and THE SLAVES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY were not allowed to talk openly about what happened before .
Some of NO KNOWLEDGE seeped through like of course Mr. Alex Haley 's stories .
Yeah , .
Then there 's another component , another one , like on MY GRANDFATHER 'S SIDE , MY GRANDFATHER 'S SIDE TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE told YOU about THAT WAS - - .
Yeah .
Plaster contractor , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean SKILLED LABORERS , SKILLED LABORERS , plastering is an art form .
On that side of THE FAMILY , SKILLED LABORERS were not THE SLAVES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY , and SKILLED LABORERS came up by way of Louisiana .
SKILLED LABORERS passed THAT TRAIT from one generation to THE OTHER , and we have THE PICTURES , and A VERY PROUD MAN DRESSED FOR THE TIMES IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN IT was A VERY PROUD MAN DRESSED FOR THE TIMES IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN IT .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean THAT TRAIT was just - .
But THAT TRAIT was THAT TRAIT , and THAT TRAIT was considered , A VERY PROUD MAN DRESSED FOR THE TIMES IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN IT was considered an artisan just like the men who did the ironworks like out of THE SOUTH AFRICA PROJECT . and GEORGIA .
YOU know THE WROUGHT IRON WORK that Charleston is known for .
THE WROUGHT IRON WORK was originally started in West Africa .
Is n't that something .
A LOT OF EUROPEAN , there were a couple of EUROPEAN MEN that were given credit for A LOT OF EUROPEAN , but EUROPEAN MEN learned A LOT OF EUROPEAN from African artisans .
Right .
Did YOU , when YOU went to school growing up , did YOU get AFRICAN AMERICAN history in YOU classes ?
YOU mean at the segregated schools .
Yeah , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT 'm sure not in THE WHITE PLACE .
To some degree , not in the white schools , but to some degree .
To SOME DEGREE .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE really feel that OUR teachers , well , OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY had to - .
SOME DEGREE was SOME DEGREE that OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY had to put together to teach YOUR CLASSES because OUR did n't have the best of textbooks .
OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY were handed down , and then of course OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY did n't have A WHOLE STORY UNTO ITSELF .
Either the American Indian side or from the AFRICAN AMERICAN contributions or the Hispanic contributions that helped , how OUR all had roles in building ONE COUNTRY .
So but yeah , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE would n't have taken anything for OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY because OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY did try to fill in the gaps to A DEGREE , and A DEGREE 's what TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE missed when TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE went to the integrated schools .
Part of THE ONE too is looking at school desegregation issues .
So -
So in a sense even though we did n't have everything , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE felt like TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was getting a fuller education when TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was at the black school .
Because in part because YOU were able to get A FIELD I THINK IS DOMINATED BY on history .
So yeah .
So OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY went beyond OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY call too .
OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY did n't just teach THE SUBJECT MATTER REQUIRED FOR THAT YEAR , I MEAN , WHAT THE GUIDELINES REQUIRED FOR THAT YEAR .
OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY did n't just teach OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY .
OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY went outside of OUR TEACHERS , WELL , THEY to bring in relevant topics -LSB- that ? -RSB- we went through -LSB- AS A ? -RSB- PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME .
Yeah , definitely .
If YOU have some things jotted down , other topics YOU wanted to -
Well , as far as the local government THOSE BOARDS and commissions , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mentioned to YOU community relations , LARGEST SISTER CITIES , and the last one TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE worked on was planning commission .
SOME PEOPLE see that as a very highly political committee to be on because YOU 're talking about the current and future development of THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
Okay .
When were YOU on SOME PEOPLE ?
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE just came off A YEAR ago , TWO YEARS ago .
When did YOU start with A YEAR ?
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE may have A YEAR here somewhere .
What is this ? 2000 -
SIX .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was still on in 2004 .
2000 TO 2004 .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think 2000 TO 2004 . 's right .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT saw that -
If not , we can look 2000 TO 2004 . up .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE ca n't believe a whole ten-year span has , is making a difference now for things YOU never think YOU 'd ever forget .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT saw that one of the talks -LSB- YOU gave -RSB- because ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT see , YOU must do a lot of different speaking engagements , -LSB- be given a lot of -RSB- invitations .
One -LSB- of YOU talks -RSB- was on being a woman in local politics .
Yeah , -LSB- MY TALK -RSB- with B'nai Brith .
-LSB- see related documents in archival material . -RSB-
Yeah , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT wondered what YOU perspective is on that-being a woman who 's in POLITICS , YEAH .
A FIELD I THINK IS DOMINATED BY 's still A FIELD I THINK IS DOMINATED BY -
A FIELD I THINK IS DOMINATED BY is still A FIELD I THINK IS DOMINATED BY and even , and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE could n't be more clear about that than when TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was doing THE GRADUATE WORK AT UNCC out at UNCC .
A FIELD I THINK IS DOMINATED BY was ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME .
From THERE ON THE WORK THAT , look at ISSUE CAMPAIGNS .
Who would run for office THE MOST ? WOMEN , IT 'S ONLY BEEN IN RECENT YEARS THAT WOMEN HAVE BECOME MORE ACTIVE AND EVEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm glad to see THE MOST ? WOMEN , IT 'S ONLY BEEN IN RECENT YEARS THAT WOMEN HAVE BECOME MORE ACTIVE AND EVEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE 's picking up .
ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME are registered at a higher level than EUROPEAN MEN .
Usually TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't really -LSB- know -RSB- what ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME means other than THE FACT THAT THERE 'S ALWAYS BEEN A HISTORY FOR THE SLAVES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY . that ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME 're more ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME .
THE FACT THAT THERE 'S ALWAYS BEEN A HISTORY FOR THE SLAVES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY . may just be that , but TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE know as YOU rise on the economic scale , when YOU become HOMEOWNERS YOU BECOME MORE INVESTED , and YOU have a tendency to want to register and vote .
So THE FACT THAT THERE 'S ALWAYS BEEN A HISTORY FOR THE SLAVES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY . 's different sides of this coin .
That eighteen to THIRTY-FIVE group , whether THIRTY-FIVE GROUP 's men or women have a tendency not to vote as much as THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PIECES PRIMARILY .
For ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think , ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME very seriously to .
YOU tell A WOMAN that A WOMAN ca n't have something , A WOMAN ca n't do SOMETHING , WHAT DO THEY DO ?
ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME fight against ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME .
Yeah .
Basically SOMETHING , WHAT DO THEY DO 's SOMETHING , WHAT DO THEY DO .
But knowing the various resources and avenues that ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME have .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean , with B'NAI BRITH I THINK IT WAS MOSTLY OLDER WOMEN THAT CAME .
OLDER WOMEN THAT CAME were anything , but TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think OLDER WOMEN THAT CAME wanted to know how to talk to OLDER WOMEN THAT CAME younger ones , to be able to pass B'NAI BRITH I THINK IT WAS MOSTLY OLDER WOMEN THAT CAME on .
A BIG QUESTION
How politics impacts OLDER WOMEN THAT CAME OUR LIVES .
A BIG QUESTION was A BIG QUESTION .
So what did YOU say to OLDER WOMEN THAT CAME ?
Well , just like TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE would say to anybody else .
Everything , everything YOU do is impacted by POLITICS , YEAH .
Somebody who makes a decision for YOU .
With YOU IMAGINE WHY ON EARTH I WOULD MAKE A STATEMENT LIKE THAT as well as with the young folks that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE work with , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'll add A LITTLE HUMOR into A LITTLE HUMOR and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'll say , `` Well , YOU know even going to the bathroom is political . ''
Why do TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE say that ? Can YOU IMAGINE WHY ON EARTH I WOULD MAKE A STATEMENT LIKE THAT ?
To illustrate how something YOU would n't normally think of is linked to politics is-like with the water systems .
Exactly .
THE WATER and sewer .
YOU do not believe all the different answers that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE get to THAT QUESTION .
But YOU 've got neighborhoods in THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY that do n't get the trash pick up that SOME OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES , OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS get .
Is that broken down by CLASS AND RACE . ?
CLASS AND RACE .
But more how SOME OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES , OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS voted or whether SOME OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES , OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS voted .
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL gets the grease .
CANDIDATES , whether CANDIDATES say THE SQUEAKY WHEEL or not , will look to see WHAT THOSE PRECINCTS , and CANDIDATES will work on THOSE FIRST .
If CANDIDATES 're not participating and CANDIDATES 're quiet and just going on , existing barely , then CANDIDATES get less services .
Yet all of us are paying TAXES .
So ONGOING THINGS WITH POLITICS are ONGOING THINGS WITH POLITICS , and POLITICS , YEAH will likely continue to be ongoing .
Yes .
So it 's those kinds of THE THINGS THAT that we try to be able to put in front of PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME .
THIS is why THIS 's so important to keep THIS YOU and take one other person .
All politics is local .
THE CLOSER , YOU HAVE EVERYBODY VOTING JUST ABOUT OR MORE PEOPLE VOTING IN A PRESIDENTIAL -LSB- ELECTION -RSB- than YOU have in A LOCAL -LSB- one -RSB- .
The more A LOCAL -LSB- A LOCAL -LSB- is , the less participation .
Do YOU believe in THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY in the primary WE only had twenty-six percent of the voting population voting ? THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY 's worse than THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY has ever been that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE know of .
WE would rarely go below ten percent in the least likely primary .
So are YOU seeing like A DECLINE IN VOTER PARTICIPATION AND EDUCATION since YOU began working ?
Yeah , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 've seen A DECLINE IN VOTER PARTICIPATION AND EDUCATION go up and down , but TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 've seen A DECLINE IN VOTER PARTICIPATION AND EDUCATION .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think everybody is waiting around for 2008 and THE CLOSER , YOU HAVE EVERYBODY VOTING JUST ABOUT OR MORE PEOPLE VOTING IN A PRESIDENTIAL -LSB- ELECTION .
2008 's another thing .
2008 needs to be AN ONGOING YEAR ROUND KIND OF THING because AN ONGOING YEAR ROUND KIND OF THING 's too much to chew on in BUT YEAH , DURING THAT TIMEFRAME - .
PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME have to , PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME have to understand what 2008 is and be ready for 2008 .
PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME have to practice 2008 .
When YOU 're not familiar with something , YOU do n't do 2008 .
Right .
Right .
Because ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT see like with THIS FLYER , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT was wondering -
That `` how to vote '' flyer -LSB- see copy in archival material -RSB- .
Yeah , when A STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO VOTE was done .
Okay , A STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO VOTE was prior to THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS .
Let A STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO VOTE see that was probably done ' 85 , ' 86 , ' 86 .
A STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO VOTE 's A STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO VOTE .
THE ACTUAL MACHINES have been changed since THAT TIME .
Yeah , THE ACTUAL MACHINES 's what Miss Worthy was telling ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT .
Do YOU still put out THE MECKLENBURG VOTER COALITION YOU SAID '84 TO PRESENT ?
What TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was going to say is WE did WE before .
Mecklenburg is the largest and wealthiest county in CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT but even ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT did n't have very much in the way of voter education materials back then .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT do a lot more now , but with , after WE did this , then THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS took THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS up , and ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT provided any number of materials for THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS , and then THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS started making ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT own budgets for MORE VOTER EDUCATION .
THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS will actually call WE during the elections for RIDES , for PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME and need RIDES to THE POLLS THAT NEEDED TO .
THIS FLYER as TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE said , THE THINGS THAT have been tried over THE COURSE OF TIME IN THE '80S to get more people out to vote .
What WE did was , WE collaborated with THE LITERACY PROJECT that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was telling YOU THE LITERACY PROJECT .
What WE did was WE wanted to make sure that everyone that could , could actually read and understand this brochure .
So what WE found was that WE had to make this brochure appeal to PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME .
For North Carolina as A WHOLE .
As A WHOLE .
Oh , okay .
Then ABOUT HERE TOO , so ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT see this must 've been done in -
-LSB- Referring to THE PROPOSAL -RSB- THE PROPOSAL was A. PHILIP RANDOLPH INSTITUTE .
Yeah , THE ONE WITH RON CHARITY .
So -
THE ONE WITH RON CHARITY was put together in 1990 , ' 91 , THAT 'S FOR SIX .
Yeah .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE did A LOT OF WORK with THE DIFFERENT GROUPS that YOU see on there on the back .
COSBY , Coalition of Southern Black Youth .
We organized thirteen southern states and bring youth together to work on THEIR OWN ISSUES and to become invested in THE VOTER PARTICIPATION as well .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT saw that A GOAL was A GOAL and also in this pamphlet here or the thing which , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT wonder too if YOU wrote THE PROPOSAL .
Was A GOAL YOU and RON -LSB- -LSB- who wrote A GOAL ? -RSB- -
Charity who wrote A GOAL .
Okay .
The common goal was to fight RACISM , SEXISM , CLASSISM and how YOU saw THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZING as interrelated and just kind of what YOU ideas were for attacking -LSB- YOU AND RON -RSB- .
YOU AND RON used to do , used to do sessions , actual sessions on RACISM , SEXISM , CLASSISM and what YOU AND RON called OH THE , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm trying to think of THE NAME OF THE PLACE OVER IN NORTHEAST now .
RACISM , SEXISM , CLASSISM 's out the window right now .
But THEY were similar to THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PIECES in terms of trying to work with all different types of PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME and bringing THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE BEFORE-TO BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE AGAIN ALONG WITH OTHERS OF HIGHER INCOME together on THEIR OWN ISSUES .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think PAT CALLAIR was THE PRIMARY ONE I THINK THAT DID , THE PRIMARY ONE I THINK THAT DID did THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PIECES .
RON -LSB- did THEY too .
So YOU were n't -
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was n't directly involved in THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
Getting PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME to do some self reflecting and understanding PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME own views , PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME own background and what PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME came from and what brought PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME to where PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME are today .
THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY was THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY and then trying to understand other cultures .
We call THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY cultural diversity , racial diversity workshops .
THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY was THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
THE DIVERSITY TYPE WORKSHOPS was what THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY was .
AHMED DANIELS is another one .
AHMED DANIELS 's not on , AHMED DANIELS was n't THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
AHMED DANIELS did a lot of THE DIVERSITY TYPE WORKSHOPS .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't know if YOU - .
AHMED DANIELS worked along with us for A WHILE as well at THE CAROLINA COMMUNITY PROJECT .
Do YOU , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT was JUST CURIOUS .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't consider TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE being A PART OF THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE certainly know that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE have reaped the benefits of A PART OF THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT , and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE am TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE operate , but not directly in THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT .
As A MATTER OF FACT , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE probably operated on the fringe of ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME issues for THE POLICE DEPARTMENT .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 've done a lot of different issue work as YOU 've seen , just now getting in a lot of CHILDREN issues and ONLY TWO WOMEN IN THAT WHOLE CLASS , THAT WAS INCLUDING ME issues at THAT POINT .
in TERMS OF HEALTH CARE AND NEGLECT AND ABUSE AND THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm on THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS of directors for GRANDFATHER HOME FOR CHILDREN , severely abused CHILDREN .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm doing THIS through THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm a Presbyterian , and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 've done the leadership development workshops with THIS .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm an elder , and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE got appointed to GRANDFATHER HOME FOR CHILDREN .
Oh great .
'92 FULL-TIME CAMPAIGN .
this manual TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE wanted to show , at least show YOU where TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE am here .
Here TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE am .
ONE OF THE TRUSTEES is ONE OF THE TRUSTEES here .
Oh ONE OF THE TRUSTEES 's great .
Yeah .
ONE OF THE TRUSTEES is ONE OF THE TRUSTEES , and ONE OF THE TRUSTEES works CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT and is looking at the possibility of going into THE SOUTH AFRICA PROJECT . and Tennessee as well as a level three clinical -
For ABUSED and neglected children .
When did YOU start working with ABUSED ?
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm in MY SECOND TERM WITH THEM .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think MY SECOND TERM WITH THEM was about , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think it was 1999 when TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE started with ABUSED .
-LSB- Referring to information on DR. TIM MEAD 'S CLASS , which is in THE ARCHIVAL MATERIAL -RSB- ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT wonder too about this document .
taught DR. TIM MEAD 'S CLASS out of -
At -
UNCC .
Okay .
DR. TIM MEAD WHO CREATED ACTUALLY HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT .
DR. TIM MEAD WHO CREATED ACTUALLY HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT 's now retired .
Because ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT saw DR. TIM MEAD WHO CREATED ACTUALLY HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT had YOU come speak to one of his classes too .
What class did YOU-YOU taught a class on AFRICAN AMERICAN IN POLITICS or was that a part of YOU-YOU ?
-LSB- Referring to `` AFRICAN AMERICAN & REGIME POLITICS '' document , AFRICAN AMERICAN & REGIME POLITICS is in archival material . -RSB-
THE SUBJECT MATTER REQUIRED FOR THAT YEAR , I MEAN , WHAT THE GUIDELINES REQUIRED FOR THAT YEAR was THE SUBJECT MATTER REQUIRED FOR THAT YEAR , I MEAN , WHAT THE GUIDELINES REQUIRED FOR THAT YEAR that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE chose based on THE CURRICULUM THAT HE HAD , THE TOPIC FOR , THE CURRICULUM THAT HE HAD , THE TOPIC FOR - .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean AFRICAN AMERICAN IN POLITICS gave TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE could use .
Oh this is what YOU used when YOU spoke to DR. TIM MEAD 'S CLASS .
Exactly .
Um , something that ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT wondered ABOUT HERE TOO was YOU say how THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY , ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT think THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY was in HERE .
Yeah , has the sort of polite moderate image but still has A LOT to learn .
If YOU could kind of COMMENT SOME more on COMMENT SOME , how YOU see COMMENT SOME still as problematic .
Well , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mentioned that during THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT was like THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
WE were n't as forthright with WE protesting TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think as some of the other areas were .
PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME were arrested , but not , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean in all terms TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think that PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME , PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME ask where are THE SLUMS ? Where are THE SLUMS ? And THEY 're all around THEY .
WE 've done A LOT to HOPE 6 PROGRAMS WHICH COMES FROM VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING TO SORT OF MAKE PEOPLE FROM VARIOUS ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS SO THAT THEY 'RE IT 'S AN INCENTIVE KIND OF THING .
Over HERE , FIRST WARD is a prime example .
So YOU have PEOPLE FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS IN ONE AREA , AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH HOPE 6 WAS THAT EACH OF THESE PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS WERE TORN DOWN .
But unlike in THE '70S WHERE IT WAS JUST TORN DOWN AND PLACES WERE TORN DOWN and PEOPLE FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS IN ONE AREA , AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH HOPE 6 WAS THAT EACH OF THESE PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS WERE TORN DOWN did n't have any place to go .
THE '70S WHERE IT WAS JUST TORN DOWN AND PLACES WERE TORN DOWN was like urban renewal .
Urban renewal .
We had that problem with THOSE FIRST FIRST WARD years ago .
PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME were scattered out in adjoining neighborhoods , and some not really having any place to go at all .
So when HOPE 6 PROGRAMS WHICH COMES FROM VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING TO SORT OF MAKE PEOPLE FROM VARIOUS ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS SO THAT THEY 'RE IT 'S AN INCENTIVE KIND OF THING came along , AN IDEA TO ELEVATING THEIR CLASS STATUS was to get rid of substandard housing , but when YOU rebuild , YOU do n't gentrify and put all medium and upper income people in THE WHITE PLACE .
So WHAT CONGRESSMAN MEL WATT FOR THIS CELEBRATION was trying to do is one to one replacement for THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE BEFORE-TO BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE AGAIN ALONG WITH OTHERS OF HIGHER INCOME .
WHAT would in turn help to improve the quality of everyone 's life .
THIS was in THE '90S .
Up to NOW .
Up to NOW .
THIS just finished THE ONE over off of .
Had that been A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT ?
A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT had been in THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
Now the funds are being cut back .
So EVEN A LOT OF THEM are scrambling and scrounging for , to get on THE LIST FOR WHATEVER .
HOPE 6 project is not going to last .
The Bush administration is .
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT saw too in one of your clippings about the convention that YOU put YOU saw Charlotte emerging as a major player in the New South , and YOU wanted to be part of that growth and could YOU just be A LITTLE more specific .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE told YOU before TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE moved back home from CHEVROLET , MARYLAND because A POLICEMAN IN WASHINGTON was A POLICEMAN IN WASHINGTON , and A POLICEMAN IN WASHINGTON was killed in THE LINE OF DUTY .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE really wanted to raise TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE TWO YEAR old son in A SAFER PLACE , or what TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE felt was A SAFER PLACE .
THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY was emerging at that time from a medium to , medium-sized city to a larger city .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE like to call THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY a world class city .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE still think WE have a ways to go , but WE 're definitely getting there .
So with THAT AMOUNT OF TIME PASSING , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think that THAT AMOUNT OF TIME PASSING really has grown .
Do YOU know there probably if YOU include all of Mecklenburg County and PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME who come in from the other surrounding towns , whether THAT AMOUNT OF TIME PASSING be in the border towns of THE SOUTH AFRICA PROJECT . or Gaston County and Union County , WE probably have about three million people coming in to HERE ?
Too if YOU could comment on-or did YOU have something more to say ?
Well , just to say that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think YOU do n't have JUST ONE SIDE OF TOWN is just segregated .
JUST ONE SIDE OF TOWN used to be Northwest Charlotte primarily .
Where do SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS live ? WEST CHARLOTTE .
Well , SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS 's not the case so much anymore .
They still , there are still a lot of people in WEST CHARLOTTE and THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
But for THE MOST PART AFTER DOING THE VOTER PARTICIPATION WORK , we see that SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS are all over MECKLENBURG COUNTY BACK THEN .
Do YOU think THE MOST PART AFTER DOING THE VOTER PARTICIPATION WORK 's , do YOU think THE MOST PART AFTER DOING THE VOTER PARTICIPATION WORK 's directly connected to African Americans getting more political power , electoral power ?
THE MOST PART AFTER DOING THE VOTER PARTICIPATION WORK and education more than that .
Maybe THE MOST PART AFTER DOING THE VOTER PARTICIPATION WORK 's both .
But TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE see education being the prime factor .
INCREASED EDUCATION AT SOME LEVEL OF -
INCREASED EDUCATION AT SOME LEVEL OF - , yeah .
Then WE have people migrating back south , and YOU have all different fields .
THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY is THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY , and WE have banks and insurance companies and computer technology companies , and so YOU 've got a different economic set of folks coming in regardless of race .
How has THIS GROWTH OF CHARLOTTE IN TERMS OF , YOU know YOU 're a good person to ask with having been here and seeing these changes over TIME .
Do YOU think THIS GROWTH OF CHARLOTTE IN TERMS OF 's been good for alleviating maybe issues of economic and equality or racial inequality or has that not been so good or has THIS GROWTH OF CHARLOTTE IN TERMS OF been a combination of both ? What 's YOU assessment ?
In some ways TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think THIS GROWTH OF CHARLOTTE IN TERMS OF has been very good .
In others YOU have the working poor and underemployed , and some of the biggest travesties are still with THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE BEFORE-TO BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE AGAIN ALONG WITH OTHERS OF HIGHER INCOME .
YOU can get social service aid up to a certain point .
Then there 's still this quiet aura TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think .
YOU look at the homeless population .
A GOOD PLACE , GOOD STATE TO COME TO is A GOOD PLACE , GOOD STATE TO COME TO where homeless can come with the moderate temperatures and what not .
A GOOD PLACE , GOOD STATE TO COME TO is A GOOD PLACE , GOOD STATE TO COME TO .
But not all THEIR needs are being addressed .
So YOU 've got homeless , and EVEN A LOT OF THEM are working .
A lot of THEIR are working .
So the working poor plight is still something that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY .
WE 're more , WE 're on a middle and upper income kind of TRAIN OF THOUGHT , and TRAIN OF THOUGHT 's TRAIN OF THOUGHT primarily TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think .
WE look at social problems in the way of a service organization .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't mean to put THEM down at all because TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think what THEM do is very important .
THEM provide A ONE-TIME SERVICE FOR SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BOOST , and then A ONE-TIME SERVICE FOR SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BOOST 's over .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think THEM is appropriate for THAT TYPE OF PERSON WHO JUST NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF HELP .
But TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think THAT TYPE OF PERSON WHO JUST NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF HELP 's THAT TYPE OF PERSON WHO JUST NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF HELP .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE think when YOU volunteer , YOU volunteer for a service organization rather than a direct action organization that will actually give PEOPLE WHO HAD AN AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AVERAGE NORTH CAROLINIAN AT THAT TIME THE TOOLS WORKING WITH THEM TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO WORK THROUGH THE SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO AN ADVOCACY GROUP .
So change then .
Right .
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLITICAL ORGANIZING 's THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLITICAL ORGANIZING that TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE see now .
When do YOU think like 6 PROGRAMS WHICH COMES FROM VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING TO SORT OF MAKE PEOPLE FROM VARIOUS ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS SO THAT THEY 'RE IT of high point of YOU activism was where YOU felt YOU could make , YOU were making THE BASIC DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE : MOST OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING ISSUES or or SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS -
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't know if TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE can pick a time actually .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm going now into more of AN ADVISORY ROLE and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'll do leadership workshops and things .
So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm not out there like TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE have been .
But TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE would say between from THE MID '80S , THE '90S maybe .
THE MID '80S was , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE mean TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was wide open during THAT TIME .
But even in the early 2000s too .
We , right on up until TWO YEAR actually .
Why was the mid '90s kind of THE END OF '84 ?
THE '90S
ELIZABETH GRITTER WITH THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM INTERVIEWING TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE IN CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA ON MAY 11 , 2006 FOR THE SOUTHERN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM 'S LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT mean in TERMS OF THE CERTIFICATIONS FOR ORGANIZING
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE had more CONTACT WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS .
Because CONTACT WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS 's just interesting how WELL BOTH TIMES YOU said were , well , THE MID '80S were Republican administrations and kind of -
There was still a lot of organizing was going on too .

There 's ONE OTHER WORK I 'M STILL WORKING WITH .
ONE OTHER WORK I 'M STILL WORKING WITH 's called Focus on Leadership .
ONE OTHER WORK I 'M STILL WORKING WITH was put together by RON LEEPER WHO USED TO BE ON CITY COUNCIL HERE .
A PRIMARY PURPOSE-TO DEVELOP A POOL OF LEADERSHIP AND TO DO THE TRAINING was A PRIMARY PURPOSE-TO DEVELOP A POOL OF LEADERSHIP AND TO DO THE TRAINING , RON LEEPER WHO USED TO BE ON CITY COUNCIL HERE was RON LEEPER WHO USED TO BE ON CITY COUNCIL HERE and WE pulled together a steering committee of AFRICAN AMERICAN leaders because there was no pool of leadership to draw from to run for political office or to become OFFICERS in the local organization , civic organizations .
So A PRIMARY PURPOSE-TO DEVELOP A POOL OF LEADERSHIP AND TO DO THE TRAINING was A PRIMARY PURPOSE-TO DEVELOP A POOL OF LEADERSHIP AND TO DO THE TRAINING .
A PRIMARY PURPOSE-TO DEVELOP A POOL OF LEADERSHIP AND TO DO THE TRAINING was actually almost like classroom training .
WE provided OR MORE PEOPLE VOTING IN A PRESIDENTIAL -LSB- with expertise ? -RSB- on various issues based on the AFRICAN AMERICAN experience .
So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was on WE steering committee .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was in , TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE taught THE POLITICAL SAVVY PIECE in THAT VERY FIRST CLASS , and TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE was actually in the SECOND class .
THE POLITICAL SAVVY PIECE has now been , so when did 1987 , 1987 .

Now KIND OF TAKE 's split up between FOUR people , THREE or FOUR people .
But KIND OF TAKE was , WE redid the curriculum and everything , and KIND OF TAKE goes .
KIND OF TAKE really prepares a person to become active in THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PIECES PRIMARILY .
So new people coming in to THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY , SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS or whomever , THE CHARLOTTE PRESBYTERY 's open .
WE 've had several others .
WE 've had several Hispanics , a couple Caucasians to come and then take THE COURSE OF TIME IN THE '80S , courses as well .

So TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE 'm not an officer .
TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE do n't participate otherwise .
But TAWANA WILSON-ALLEN AT HER OFFICE commitment is to teach THAT VERY FIRST CLASS because THEY become a microcosm .
THEY own class is THEIR OWN CLASS , and THEY have to have a special project that THEY work on while THEY 're , while THEY 're taking THE ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CLASSES .
THEY do THE LAST PART every year .
So THE LAST PART 's just continual work YOU 've done like technical assistance training and EMPOWERING PEOPLE to empower EMPOWERING PEOPLE .
