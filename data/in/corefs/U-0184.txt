Okay , THE TWENTIETH OF MAY , 2006 is THE TWENTIETH OF MAY , 2006 .
THE TWENTIETH OF MAY , 2006 's THE TWENTIETH OF MAY , 2006 .
MY NAME is SARAH THUESEN and SARAH THUESEN 'm interviewing for THE LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT , THE LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PROJECT .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , SARAH THUESEN thought WE would FIRST just go back over some of the organizations and activities YOU 've been involved with in THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
SARAH THUESEN wanted to get a slightly clearer picture of how FIRST all fits together .
YOU were saying in WE FIRST interview that YOU worked for THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION .
YOU FIRST became involved with that when YOU FIRST moved here .
FIRST 's FIRST .
Is that right ?
Yes , FIRST 's called THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY STRATEGY FORCE .
Okay .
FIRST 's OUR neighborhood association .
OUR just use FIRST since MY NAME is so long .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME also re-formed THE COMMUNITY WATCH PROGRAM in OUR neighborhood in 2000 .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME also helped redevelop OUR Community Development Corporation which is OUR CDC .
THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY STRATEGY FORCE , was formed in 1986 ?
Yes , THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY STRATEGY FORCE was formed in 1986 by ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE AT THAT TIME .
Were THE FOLKS who sat on THAT ALL NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS or did THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY STRATEGY FORCE include CITY REPRESENTATIVES ?
THE BELMONT NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY STRATEGY FORCE 's all neighborhood residents and YOUR business owners that have businesses within THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
NO WHERE , THE FOLKS do n't have any city people that sit on THE FOLKS boards at all .
YOU became president of that organization at some point , right ?
In 2003 , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME became president of THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION .
How long is the typical term there ?
YOU CURRENTLY have a rotation of THREE YEARS and then YOUR are re-elected or if at THAT TIME , at the end of THREE YEARS , there is not another person that would be running then YOUR can be re-elected for an additional three years .
At the end of SIX YEARS , ' 98 YOUR have to step down .
Are YOU CURRENTLY still - ?
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm currently still there .
Then THE BELMONT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION , WHAT YEAR DID THAT FORM ?
THAT WAS FORMED - ? THAT WAS FORMED - was nonfunctioning when DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME came into THE NEIGHBORHOOD in ' 93 .
THAT WAS FORMED - had n't functioned in SIX YEARS , ' 98 .
As WE got involved with THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION and THE COMMUNITY WATCH PROGRAM WE became aware of the CDC not functioning .
WE started A TEAM , A TEAM , and went forth with THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE .
THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE said , `` WE 'll come in and help YOUR all re-develop YOUR corporations . ''
WE spent about A YEAR or ABOUT SIX MONTHS going back through the process of reorganizing WE whole CDC with new bylaws and assessments and all this stuff .
A YEAR took WE about ABOUT SIX MONTHS to A YEAR .
So there had been ONE IN THE PAST .
ONE IN THE PAST just was n't functioning .
ONE IN THE PAST just was n't functioning at THAT TIME .
Would YOU say that THE TIME YOU WERE RE-FORMING THE GROUP was maybe around 2000 or so ?
THE TIME YOU WERE RE-FORMING THE GROUP was during 2000 .
How is the function of OUR WHOLE CDC ?
The OUR WHOLE CDC constructs affordable housing .
THEY do a lot of financial business work , like to get THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE homes , to help THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE to get qualified .
THEY can do THE FUNDING for the home buyers , STUFF OF THAT NATURE .
THEY have been known to do COMMUNITY EFFORTS work also .
-LSB- interruption -RSB- DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm busy .
Do YOU want SARAH THUESEN to pause THE FUNDING for a minute ?
Yeah , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm busy .
Go , go , go .
THE FUNDING 's for something else .
Now go back outside and shut THE DOOR .
Bye-bye .
-LSB- Laughter -RSB-
THEY have initiatives .
OUR WHOLE CDC has initiatives that THEY have to perform in order to stay in existence in a neighborhood which is some of the things WE do .
WE try to do DIFFERENT THINGS so WE wo n't be walking over each other with the same projects .
THEY mainly stick with financing , home buyers and stuff of THAT NATURE .
THEY do have partnerships with CITY REPRESENTATIVES , right ?
THEY do and OUR WHOLE CDC just so happen to have to be funded by THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE because CITY REPRESENTATIVES did not have FUNDS on OUR OWN to actually start OUR WHOLE CDC up with .
OUR WHOLE CDC is being funded through THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE .
That director is being paid through the city and grant funds .
Are there any other organizations that are BELMONT BASED THAT I 'M LEAVING OUT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH ?
NO WHERE , WE have all kinds in THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
Basically , NO WHERE pop up everyday .
YOUR hear about NO WHERE ONE DAY and NO WHERE 're disappeared THE NEXT DAY .
WE do have Right MOVES to Youth but MOVES 's nonfunctioning .
The lady that was running ONE DAY just fell through the cracks .
ONE DAY 's ONE DAY that WE have THAT ARE AVAILABLE but THAT ARE AVAILABLE were given - .
DIFFERENT PEOPLE took on those responsibilities so ONE DAY just fell through the crack .
When DIFFERENT PEOPLE got tired of ONE DAY and DIFFERENT PEOPLE could n't get A WHOLE BUNCH OF RESPONSES to A WHOLE BUNCH OF RESPONSES DIFFERENT PEOPLE just dropped ONE DAY .
Now THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION is going back trying to pick up on SOME OF THESE THINGS so that SOME OF THESE THINGS can distribute SOME OF THESE THINGS out evenly throughout all the neighborhood so all the neighborhood will be aware of the different programs that WE have .
What 's the biggest challenge in sustaining AN ORGANIZATION and making AN ORGANIZATION last ?
Keeping THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE interested , on the go , motivated .
Keeping YOUR residents mainly informed is the biggest problem .
YOUR RESIDENTS MAINLY INFORMED have to be involved in order for THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION to function properly .
We can function all day without THE INPUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS .
THE INPUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS would n't be run as an association .
THE INPUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS would be more like a group of people running THE WAY I THING IT SHOULD BE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT .
THE INPUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS should be RESIDENTS RUNNING THE NEIGHBORHOOD THROUGH THE ASSOCIATION .
THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION should be-is the resort to where YOUR go to , to make sure that RESIDENTS RUNNING THE NEIGHBORHOOD THROUGH THE ASSOCIATION wants , needs , and COMMUNITY EFFORTS are put forth to wherever , to make sure WE RUNNING THE RIGHT DIRECTION are heard , and make sure WE RUNNING THE RIGHT DIRECTION .
WE RUNNING THE RIGHT DIRECTION do take A LOT OF TRAINING CLASSES .
THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE offers A LOT OF TRAINING CLASSES .
WE RUNNING THE RIGHT DIRECTION find out from other groups of people about TRAINING CLASSES .
WE RUNNING THE RIGHT DIRECTION attend BASICALLY A LEARNING SITUATION ALL THE TIME .
BASICALLY A LEARNING SITUATION ALL THE TIME 's BASICALLY A LEARNING SITUATION ALL THE TIME .
What sorts of TRAINING CLASSES have YOU taken ?
Leadership .
Management .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME went through the Anger Management programs that THEY have .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME went through THEY resource classes , THEIR RESOURCE CLASSES how to get THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE interested in participating , ORGANIZATIONAL TRAINING , organizational skill training .
, ORGANIZATIONAL TRAINING 's been SEVERAL .
, ORGANIZATIONAL TRAINING 's many of SEVERAL .
So A LEARNING PROCESS has really been A LEARNING PROCESS .
For DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 've learned A LOT IN THE LAST THREE YEARS than DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME ever have in A LIFETIME .
A LOT IN THE LAST THREE YEARS 's interesting because A LOT IN THE LAST THREE YEARS 's always something new .
Thinking about all of your activism in THE NEIGHBORHOOD , who would YOU say have been YOU most important allies ?
YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES are DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME most important allies because DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can go to YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES and talk .
Without YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES support YOUR really ca n't do anything .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think working as a group has more power than AN INDIVIDUAL 'S voice .
Usually , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME talk A LOT to YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES and YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES talk and YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES talk .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME try to put A LOT together in DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME own words .
Sometimes YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES have A TENDENCY TO TELL YOU SOMETHING but YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES mean something else .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME have to constantly go back and say , `` Did YOUR really mean-can WE talk about A TENDENCY TO TELL YOU SOMETHING again before I actually try to find someone - ? '' DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm good for picking up THE PHONE .
WE have what YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES call a neighborhood list of all of your different neighborhoods and presidents and STUFF OF THAT NATURE .
If DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME have A PROBLEM I PICK UP THE PHONE AND I JUST GO THROUGH THOSE AND ASK , `` HAVE YOU EVER HAD SUCH AND SUCH THING HAPPEN TO YOU ? WHERE CAN I GET SOME HELP ? WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES ? '' USUALLY EVER HAD SUCH AND SUCH THING are pretty good at A PROBLEM I PICK UP THE PHONE AND I JUST GO THROUGH THOSE AND ASK , `` HAVE YOU EVER HAD SUCH AND SUCH THING HAPPEN TO YOU ? WHERE CAN I GET SOME HELP ? WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES ? '' USUALLY .
So if YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES have been YOU most important ally who do YOU see as YOU most significant opponents in some of the fights that YOU 've tried to push ?
THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
The city of CHARLOTTE 'S .
YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES are so huge and YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES have so many different departments .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think where THE BREAK down comes with us is YOUR talk to one person and THE BREAK lingers .
YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES have to go through A DUE PROCESS to get A DUE PROCESS to the right person .
Then , A DUE PROCESS lays and that person is so busy doing other things .
Right now , A DUE PROCESS 's THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE .
WE 're working on YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES .
WE have A COORDINATOR WHICH IS NAMED RANDY HARRIS .
A COORDINATOR WHICH IS NAMED RANDY HARRIS 's good .
A COORDINATOR WHICH IS NAMED RANDY HARRIS 's really good , but A COORDINATOR WHICH IS NAMED RANDY HARRIS 's just so tied up and A COORDINATOR WHICH IS NAMED RANDY HARRIS 's involved in so many other issues .
It 's sort of hard to catch up with A COORDINATOR WHICH IS NAMED RANDY HARRIS and to sit down and actually do some of THE THINGS THAT 'S NOT WHAT YOU SEE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD that WE really push to ask A COORDINATOR WHICH IS NAMED RANDY HARRIS about .
But A COORDINATOR WHICH IS NAMED RANDY HARRIS 's good .
What do YOU see as the ideal role that the local government should be playing , or the state and federal government should be playing in helping THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE find affordable housing , SUSTAINABLE NEIGHBORHOODS ?
In THE PAST , THE HOMEOWNERS DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 've noticed that THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE are involved in THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE but THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE seem to run over the top of each other .
Nothing ever gets settled in SUSTAINABLE NEIGHBORHOODS .
To DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , THE PAST , THE HOMEOWNERS would be - .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME read a while back where THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE said THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE ON THEIR OWN .
There should be A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE that THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE could train THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE to THE POINT WHERE THEY COULD GO TO THE STATE AND COULD PULL FUNDS OR ASK FOR THINGS THAT THAT PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS AND OBTAIN THOSE RESOURCES WITHOUT THE RED TAPE OF GOING THROUGH THE CITY , THE STATE , THE GOV - , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH and on and on and on .
-LSB- interruption -RSB- DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm trying to interview right here so stop coming through HERE please .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME wish HERE would just put A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE back into the hands of THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE ON THEIR OWN .
A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE seems to DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME YOUR have communities that do all of their work within that community .
It seems that YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES are much happier people .
YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES can get things done and YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES do n't have to wait around MONTHS TO A YEAR FOR PERMISSION FOR THIS AND FOR A BUDGET FOR THIS .
YOUR can just actually go out and do .
Usually , MONTHS TO A YEAR FOR PERMISSION FOR THIS AND FOR A BUDGET FOR THIS 's like THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE relays to THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE and THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE relays to community .
Has THE MEDIA helped or hurt YOU work in BELMONT BASED THAT I 'M LEAVING OUT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH ?
THE MEDIA has helped OUR work because at one point in THE TIME YOU WERE RE-FORMING THE GROUP OUR could n't get any type of outside resource help .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think they had a couple of coverages on OUR .
OUR just got THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE from everywhere wanting to come in and help to do DIFFERENT THINGS .
Was YOUR WORK THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER , DID A BIG WRITE UP ON IT , ON OUR NEIGHBORHOOD or the TV ?
YOUR WORK was THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER , DID A BIG WRITE UP ON IT , ON OUR NEIGHBORHOOD .
After YOUR WORK DIFFERENT THINGS started happening ?
Yeah , SORT OF .
After OUR made THEM happen .
OUR sort of pushed SORT OF to happen .
OUR had THE BARRICADES .
OUR sort of demanded that THEM come down .
Well , OUR asked that THEM come down because OUR were told THEM were temporary for THE - . -LSB- interruption -RSB-
SARAH THUESEN think THE - did n't catch that last little bit .
If YOU do n't mind let SARAH THUESEN just get YOU to explain THE BARRICADES once more .
THE BARRICADES were put up to decrease crime .
Crime and to cut down on THE TRAFFICKING .
They said THE PEOPLE THAT WAS DRIVING THROUGH BUYING DRUGS OR WHATEVER , which THE TRAFFICKING did help with THE TWENTIETH OF MAY , 2006 .
THE TRAFFICKING did help subside some of the crime in THE AREA .
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE could n't drive through to get THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE dope .
KENNON STREET , as DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME said , KENNON STREET was KENNON STREET .
THE TRAFFICKING was like everybody came KENNON STREET to purchase DRUGS .
All YOUR drug dealers used to hang on KENNON STREET .
During THIS , after SIX YEARS , ' 98 , WE approached THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE about - .
Well , THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN REFERENCE TO WHEN WOULD THEY be taking THE BARRICADES down .
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN REFERENCE TO WHEN WOULD THEY 's when WE were told THIS are permanent .
WE are like , well , nobody told WE .
YOUR told WE THIS were temporary .
THIS could come down whenever .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't think THIS wanted THIS to come down .
So in '98 THIS had been up SIX YEARS , ' 98 ?
Yeah .
We were determined .
After SIX YEARS , ' 98 DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm tired of running the block to get in and out .
Then THE PEOPLE here would have to take THE BLOCK TO GO TO ONE SECTION .
THE BLOCK TO GO TO ONE SECTION would just beginning to be bugged out .
If YOUR 're talking about revitalizing A NEIGHBORHOOD-WHO would want to buy A HOME in THE WAY I THING IT SHOULD BE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT where YOUR got barricades sitting in the middle of THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
A NEIGHBORHOOD-WHO does n't look feasible to DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME would be turned off by A NEIGHBORHOOD-WHO .
THEY were n't the pretty barricades .
THE SIDE STREETS COMING FROM PARKWOOD OVER ON TO KENNON STREET were THE SIDE STREETS COMING FROM PARKWOOD OVER ON TO KENNON STREET and SOME RED .
Then THEY had some dirt around SOME RED where it was supposed to been pretty THE FLOWERS .
THE PEOPLE always stomped THE FLOWERS .
THE PEOPLE always trashed THE AREA .
The people on THE CORNER usually had to clean that up , along with anything else .
Then THE FLOWERS died .
THE CORNER was just horrible .
Then the weeds would just grow up .
If NO YOU did n't cut THEM , THE STATE , THE CITY , ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE never cut THEM .
If YOUR are going to own A PIECE OF PROPERTY in NO YOU neighborhood at least take care of A PIECE OF PROPERTY .
NO YOU just decided maybe OUR TIME 's OUR TIME .
A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE would make A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE more presentable to THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE just coming through .
YOUR 'd have more assets in NO YOU neighborhoods because NO YOU need all the assets - .
NO YOU have A LARGE NEIGHBORHOOD .
NO YOU have 3500 people in NO YOU neighborhoods .
SUSTAINABLE NEIGHBORHOODS 's A LARGE NEIGHBORHOOD and all of the kids .
NO YOU just need as much assets in and out that NO YOU can get .
Everything that happens downtown , THE BIKE-A-THONS , the run-a-thons , THE BIKE-A-THONS want to run through Belmont for some reason .
If THE BIKE-A-THONS 're running A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE NO YOU are blocked in at THAT TIME .
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN REFERENCE TO WHEN WOULD THEY told NO YOU that THE BIKE-A-THONS could n't take THE BIKE-A-THONS down .
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN REFERENCE TO WHEN WOULD THEY would cost X amount of money , $ 5000 , blah , blah , blah .
NO YOU were like NO YOU did n't tell NO YOU NO YOU had to pay to take THE BIKE-A-THONS down .
YOUR said THE BIKE-A-THONS were temporary .
THIS went on for ABOUT SIX MONTHS .
THIS had to do surveys to find out - .
WE did A PETITION for YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES to have A PETITION taken down .
THE POLICE decided , `` Well , WE need to do WE own survey .
OUR OWN SURVEY may just be because YOUR people that live on the corners , that OUR OWN SURVEY 's bothering the most .
THE OTHER RESIDENTS see OUR OWN SURVEY as a help still . ''
WE outbidded THE OTHER RESIDENTS .
WE had more petition names than THE OTHER RESIDENTS had .
THE OTHER RESIDENTS finally-it took THE OTHER RESIDENTS another six months to come up with the monies to take THE BARRICADES down which WE had one at KENNON and Parsons .
WE had one at KENNON and Olmstead .
So FIFTEEN , TWENTY OF THEM different places ?
Yeah , but THE OTHER RESIDENTS are both on KENNON .
YOUR go down KENNON and THE SIDE STREETS COMING FROM PARKWOOD OVER ON TO KENNON STREET are THE SIDE STREETS COMING FROM PARKWOOD OVER ON TO KENNON STREET .
KENNON was YOUR hot spot .
When did THE OTHER RESIDENTS finally come down THEN ?
THEN took THE OTHER RESIDENTS until 2001 , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME believe .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think THE OTHER RESIDENTS took THE OTHER RESIDENTS down like in 2001 or 2000 .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME really ca n't remember that date .
THEN took US ALMOST A YEAR before THE OTHER RESIDENTS brought THE OTHER RESIDENTS down .
What was the effect of taking US down ?
US had the news media press .
THE OTHER RESIDENTS came and did THE THING WE NEEDED TO DO TO KEEP DOWN THE TRAFFIC AND THE DRUG PROBLEM write up about THE THING WE NEEDED TO DO TO KEEP DOWN THE TRAFFIC AND THE DRUG PROBLEM .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't think-the police department did n't like THE THING WE NEEDED TO DO TO KEEP DOWN THE TRAFFIC AND THE DRUG PROBLEM too well .
THE OTHER RESIDENTS were invited and THE OTHER RESIDENTS were here .
THE OTHER RESIDENTS just wanted to make sure that THE THING WE NEEDED TO DO TO KEEP DOWN THE TRAFFIC AND THE DRUG PROBLEM was THE THING WE NEEDED TO DO TO KEEP DOWN THE TRAFFIC AND THE DRUG PROBLEM .
So far WE 've done that .
Without THE BARRICADE ?
Without THE BARRICADES .
THE BARRICADE was going to happen anyway without THE BARRICADES .
To DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , THE BARRICADE helped the traffic flow at THAT TIME .
Nobody was really into THE COMMUNITY WATCH PROGRAM .
A lot of YOU PEOPLE THAT LIVE ON THE CORNERS , THAT IT 'S BOTHERING THE MOST were afraid to call 9-1-1 .
A LOT OF PEOPLE did n't communicate that THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE felt unsafe .
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE would just stay in THEIR HOUSES .
At night THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE would n't come out .
YOUR could n't sit on YOUR porch or entertain because of the gunfire and the drug DEALERS STANDING AROUND and robberies , just anytime .
After THE COMMUNITY WATCH PROGRAM went into effect and DEALERS STANDING AROUND knew that THE COMMUNITY WATCH PROGRAM was A LOT OF PEOPLE signed up for THE COMMUNITY WATCH PROGRAM .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think THE COMMUNITY WATCH PROGRAM slowed down the crime A LOT .
We felt more at ease really .
Why were folks previously afraid to call 9-1-1 ?
Because 9-1-1 was so prevalent , THE DRUG DEALERS were so prevalent in THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
THE SIDE STREETS COMING FROM PARKWOOD OVER ON TO KENNON STREET are THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE .
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE actually lived in THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
Some of THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE were just - .
SOME OF YOUR ELDERLY PEOPLE , SOME OF YOUR ELDERLY PEOPLE would help SOME OF YOUR ELDERLY PEOPLE out financially .
If YOUR 're getting SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE that YOUR do n't ordinarily have YOUR might have A PROBLEM with YOUR calling 9-1-1 .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME did n't know of anyone in PARTICULAR that PARTICULAR happened to .
PARTICULAR is what we were told by some of THE POLICE OFFICERS .
Maybe SOME OF THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE are being assisted because THE DRUG DEALERS hung out on THE DRUG DEALERS properties .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think SOME OF THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE just hung out because SOME OF THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE knew YOUR ELDERLY PEOPLE .
SOME OF THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE felt safer on THEIR PROPERTY .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't think SOME OF THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE were-you know , okay , YOUR can hang out here .
THEIR PROPERTY just happened A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE .
Like MY HOUSE , MY HOUSE just happened .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME never said MY HOUSE 's okay .
YOUR could tell THEM and MY HOUSE would be , `` Okay , not today . ''
Then THEM would be right back that SAME EVENING .
THEM were even double .
SAME EVENING would be FIFTEEN , TWENTY OF THEM or three and THE NEXT THING YOUR know FIFTEEN , TWENTY OF THEM would be FIFTEEN , TWENTY OF THEM .
So what do YOUR do then ? YOUR do n't go out fist fighting .
YOUR do n't go out hollering and screaming .
If YOUR dial 9-1-1 back then at 9-1-1 THE TIME YOU WERE RE-FORMING THE GROUP - - .
We had a lot of problems with THE POLICE OFFICERS - .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't know if it was THE DISPATCH SYSTEM THEY HAD .
YOUR would call for 9-1-1 then the officer would knock on YOUR door .
9-1-1 was almost like the drug dealer standing here and THE POLICE knocking on YOUR door .
YOUR talking to THEM AND THE NEXT THING YOUR know YOUR got flat tires on YOUR car .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME went through about TWELVE flat tires .
TWELVE was like a ordinary thing , YOUR know , from THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE , flatten YOUR tires .
YOU suspected THE SIDE STREETS COMING FROM PARKWOOD OVER ON TO KENNON STREET were drug dealers who did THIS ?
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME have NO IDEA .
NO IDEA never fazed THIS .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME knew NO IDEA had to do something with DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME working with community watch and just walking THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
Everybody knew DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't think NO IDEA was any of THE DRUG DEALERS .
NO IDEA was nothing really going on .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME would talk to THE DRUG DEALERS just like ordinary people .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME respected THE DRUG DEALERS and THE DRUG DEALERS started respecting DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME had A PROBLEM .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think A PROBLEM was A PROBLEM or something like SOME KIDS .
Nothing THE THING WE NEEDED TO DO TO KEEP DOWN THE TRAFFIC AND THE DRUG PROBLEM .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME dealt with THE THING WE NEEDED TO DO TO KEEP DOWN THE TRAFFIC AND THE DRUG PROBLEM and kept going .
-LSB- PAUSE -RSB-
Do YOU talk with YOU children and grandchildren about YOU activism ?
YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN are THE TWENTIETH OF MAY , 2006 .
YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN were here .
SOME KIDS were actually living here when we moved in .
Well , one of my daughters was .
The other one came later .
SOME KIDS stayed for a couple of SIX YEARS , ' 98 .
SOME KIDS actually participate in a lot in SIX YEARS , ' 98 .
SOME KIDS go to A LOT OF THE TRAINING .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME FIFTEEN , TWENTY OF THEM daughters go to A LOT OF THE TRAINING .
MY GRANDKIDS are-form the Belmont Diamond Youth Council .
What does ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE AT THAT TIME do ?
ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE AT THAT TIME deals with SOME KIDS , at risk youth .
What WE do is try to keep SOME KIDS occupied with healthy things .
WE try to take SOME KIDS out of THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
WE try to teach SOME KIDS about art .
WE take SOME KIDS to-maybe send SOME KIDS to art classes , see some of THE THINGS THAT 'S NOT WHAT YOU SEE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD all the time .
WE let SOME KIDS know there is another life outside of THE CRIME , THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEING IN THE SHAPE THAT IT 'S IN NOW .
There are THE OTHER PEOPLE and there are other places that YOUR can go .
Where have YOU taken THE OTHER PEOPLE ?
THE OTHER PEOPLE have went swimming .
THE OTHER PEOPLE love to go swimming .
WE take THE OTHER PEOPLE to the aquatic center .
WE take THE OTHER PEOPLE to the movies .
WE took THE OTHER PEOPLE to a farm , some kind of animal farm up in-way out in THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE ANIMALS AND HORSES .
WE spent ONE DAY there so THE OTHER PEOPLE could see the animals in the woods .
THE OTHER PEOPLE love COUNTRY LIFE .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't know why THE OTHER PEOPLE love COUNTRY LIFE .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME guess because SOME KIDS there had motorbikes and all this stuff .
SOME KIDS did n't have to worry about CARS AND STUFF OF THAT NATURE .
We 've taken SOME KIDS - .
SOME KIDS 've had MARTIAL ARTS .
SOME KIDS took MARTIAL ARTS for THREE YEARS .
SOME KIDS have done a little bit of everything now .
Usually , WE started out with about thirty children and as WE went through SOME KIDS 've sort of dwindled .
Most of SOME KIDS have moved out and the ones that were involved either pulled out or just got disinterested during the last year or so .
SOME KIDS really do n't want to stay situated .
Sometimes YOUR have to be situated in order to grow .
WE do n't think taking YOUR to A MOVIE , A MOVIE , and THE BEST OF ALL THINGS TO BE DOING ALL THE TIME is THE BEST OF ALL THINGS TO BE DOING ALL THE TIME .
YOUR can learn other processes , how to organize .
WE are trying to get him into SOME OF THE YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS .
SHAMARIO , MY GRANDSON , IN FACT , is SHAMARIO , MY GRANDSON , IN FACT .
So , SOME OF THE YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS runs in THE FAMILY .
Yeah .
THE FAMILY 's just SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE .
THE FAMILY likes to know DIFFERENT THINGS about what THE FAMILY 's - .
THE FAMILY 's nosy .
THE FAMILY loves to go to all of the meetings that DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME go to , goes to THE TRAINING , SOME OF THE TRAININGS I HAVE .
THE FAMILY 's learning .
THE TRAINING , SOME OF THE TRAININGS I HAVE 's good .
What would YOU most like YOU children and grandchildren to remember about YOU own work in THE NEIGHBORHOOD ?
YOUR OWN WORK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD there is YOUR OWN WORK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD .
YOUR OWN WORK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD may not look good at that particular time because YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN 're always on DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME back : `` YOUR really need to drop all that and just let YOUR OWN WORK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ride . ''
YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN would prefer DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME to just shut MY HOUSE down and just move , just come and live with YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN .
A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE YOUR can save YOUR money .
YOUR do n't have to worry about fixing that old house .
YOUR do n't have to worry about YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN people running around with guns .
YOUR do n't have to worry about MY GRANDKIDS getting hurt , blah , blah , blah .
MY GRANDKIDS would love to see DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME just shut it down and move on .
What keeps YOU from doing that ?
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME individuality .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME want to be AN INDIVIDUAL 'S .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't know .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME just like to speak out DIFFERENT THINGS .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME feel like if nobody ever speaks out about IT .
IT just goes undone .
IT 's how WE 've gotten this far .
Somebody took the initiative to speak out .
If nobody speaks out where WE going ? NO WHERE .
WE are going to stay stuck .
Stuck like glue in the same spot .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can voice MY OPINION , not even living here ; DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can voice MY OPINION which DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME always will regardless if DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm here or anywhere .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME have A VOICE and DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do use A VOICE .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do AN IMPULSE THING before DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME use A VOICE .
AN IMPULSE THING 's not like DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME offer a spur of the moment speech .
If DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm going to talk about something DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm going to go research AN IMPULSE THING FIRST .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME like to be right when DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME speak out .
AN IMPULSE THING 's why DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't classify DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME as AN ACTIVIST because DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do research FIRST .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think ACTIVISTS go on impulses more so than ACTIVISTS do-they probably do , do research .
All the ones that DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME know ACTIVISTS are like , AN IMPULSE THING 's AN IMPULSE THING .
ACTIVISTS feel AN IMPULSE THING .
AN IMPULSE THING comes out .
ACTIVISTS work at AN IMPULSE THING and ACTIVISTS solve AN IMPULSE THING .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME like to go back .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME like to read about something .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME got to ask somebody something .
Then DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'll feel more comfortable .
If DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME know what DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm talking about THEN DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can relay THEN to YOUR better .
What would YOU say , thinking about all YOU years working in THE NEIGHBORHOOD , is YOU proudest accomplishment ?
Proudest accomplishment .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 've had a lot of those DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think .
When DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME FIRST did THE COMMUNITY WATCH PROGRAM , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME did n't feel comfortable because FIRST was FIRST .
The best one was when DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME actually-being SHAMARIO , MY GRANDSON , IN FACT for BASICALLY A LEARNING SITUATION ALL THE TIME while BASICALLY A LEARNING SITUATION ALL THE TIME was like WE could do this .
WE 've accomplished ONE DAY .
Right now , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm at THE POINT WHERE THEY COULD GO TO THE STATE AND COULD PULL FUNDS OR ASK FOR THINGS THAT THAT PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS AND OBTAIN THOSE RESOURCES WITHOUT THE RED TAPE OF GOING THROUGH THE CITY , THE STATE , THE GOV - , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH to where THE POINT WHERE THEY COULD GO TO THE STATE AND COULD PULL FUNDS OR ASK FOR THINGS THAT THAT PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS AND OBTAIN THOSE RESOURCES WITHOUT THE RED TAPE OF GOING THROUGH THE CITY , THE STATE , THE GOV - , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH 's nothing that THE COMMUNITY PEOPLE talk about that DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't feel like DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can accomplish for THE COMMUNITY PEOPLE .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME guess YOUR call SHAMARIO , MY GRANDSON , IN FACT go getter , A FIGHTER , MORE SO THAN AN ACTIVIST .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm A FIGHTER , MORE SO THAN AN ACTIVIST .
If DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME believe in something DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm going to question THE POINT WHERE THEY COULD GO TO THE STATE AND COULD PULL FUNDS OR ASK FOR THINGS THAT THAT PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS AND OBTAIN THOSE RESOURCES WITHOUT THE RED TAPE OF GOING THROUGH THE CITY , THE STATE , THE GOV - , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH to the last resort .
If DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME ca n't get THE ANSWERS there DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME move on until DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME get THE ANSWERS .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME never leave any stones uncovered .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME never burn THE WAY I AM , so DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can always go back .
THE WAY I AM 's like A DOG COVERING A BONE and A DOG COVERING A BONE 'll go back and get THAT SAME BONE and continuously work on THAT SAME BONE until THAT SAME BONE 's completed .
THE WAY I AM 's THE WAY I AM .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME like to complete A TASK when DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME start A TASK .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME like to complete A TASK .
What 's the biggest task right now that YOU see as incomplete in the BELMONT BASED THAT I 'M LEAVING OUT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH neighborhood ?
Getting OUR revitalization plan to THE POINT WHERE I CAN UNDERSTAND SPANISH A LOT to where OUR feel comfortable that this is what is going to work in OUR neighborhood .
OUR know that there are other businesses , like THE HOPE VI , WHICH CAME ALONG LATER AND WAS REINSTALLED INTO OUR PLAN and all this stuff that got to combine into THE HOPE VI , WHICH CAME ALONG LATER AND WAS REINSTALLED INTO OUR PLAN .
OUR understand that .
OUR want to see that the plans , the year that SIX OF US went to THESE MEETINGS twice a week for a whole year to set OUR REVITALIZATION PLAN together , OUR want to at least be - .
OUR want THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE to know that OUR did n't waste OUR time .
OUR felt like right now OUR wasted A LOT OF OUR TIME in THESE MEETINGS and for A LOT OF OUR TIME not to go any farther than where A LOT OF OUR TIME has gone .
OUR see more effort put into THE HOPE VI , WHICH CAME ALONG LATER AND WAS REINSTALLED INTO OUR PLAN , than anything that OUR set for A YEAR to get started .
OUR have n't seen any of that work start yet .
OUR hear that they are in A DUE PROCESS .
A DUE PROCESS 's going to take THE TIME YOU WERE RE-FORMING THE GROUP .
OUR know this .
If YOUR can start THE HOPE VI , WHICH CAME ALONG LATER AND WAS REINSTALLED INTO OUR PLAN , then YOUR should have started something of OUR .
Give OUR SOMETHING TO SHOW AN EFFORT THAT WE DID N'T WASTE OUR TIME FOR THE TIME WE WAS THERE .
Of THAT REVITALIZATION PLAN WHAT PIECE OF IT ARE YOU MOST INTERESTED IN SEEING ENACTED ?
The main part that OUR were worried about were THE HOMEOWNERS THAT WERE ALREADY HERE .
THE TAXATION .
OUR know that THE TAXATION . 's going to be renewed .
OUR know that THE TAX is going to go sky high .
OUR already know .
OUR wanted to get some kind of tax abatement program put in place whereas THE TAX would give A HOME OWNERS THAT WERE HERE DURING THE TIME THAT THE PLAN WAS WRITTEN , not YOUR new home owners , but the ones that have been here five , SIX OF US , ten years that have been fighting this length of THE TIME YOU WERE RE-FORMING THE GROUP , give OWNERS THAT WERE HERE DURING THE TIME THAT THE PLAN WAS WRITTEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT SOME FUNDS ASIDE TO CATCH UP WITH THE TAX increases that OUR have had .
OUR has n't happened .
OUR had a double tax increase all of a sudden .
YOUR have A LOT OF PEOPLE here with fixed incomes .
A LOT OF PEOPLE 's not elderly-they say medium to low incomes .
OUR probably got medium incomes but before everybody 's income was about THE SAME .
With the elderly living on OUR OWN , in THEIR OWN HOMES OUR know THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE ca n't pay DOUBLE TAXES on THEIR PROPERTIES .
OUR know THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE have THIS TAXATION PROGRAM IF YOU 'RE SIXTY and make $ 19,900 A YEAR YOUR can get A TAX BREAK .
If YOUR worked A GOOD JOB and retired YOUR going to get more that $ 19,900 .
A GOOD JOB 's not helping THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE either .
OUR continue to work on something even with OUR attorney .
Is THIS TED FILLETTE ?
THIS 's not .
MY NAME is Paul Steffens .
TED FILLETTE 's with KENNEDY AND COVINGTON .
Then WE are working with the state level trying to see if KENNEDY AND COVINGTON could work something out through congress or whatever .
Give WE like a tax THIS TAXATION PROGRAM IF YOU 'RE SIXTY - .
WE feel like WE 're going to lose ONE WAY .
WE 're not going to lose from somebody snatching WE houses up , unless ONE WAY 's the tax collector or YOUR mortgage company .
WE 's one reason why WE did decide to have ATTORNEYS WORKING WITH US .
YOUR have foreclosures going on right now quite frequently .
If YOUR ca n't pay YOUR taxes WE know ATTORNEYS WORKING WITH US can eventually foreclose on YOUR properties and seize YOUR properties .
Hopefully , WE can put some fire there and say YOUR may take THEIR PROPERTY but it wo n't be an easy task for YOUR to take THEIR PROPERTIES in WE neighborhood .
WE feel like WE 's ONE THING THAT 'S GOING TO COME .
YOUR know YOUR are going to YOUR 're YOUR $ 100,000 homes , YOUR $ 200,000 homes .
YOUR 're going to have YOUR tax increases but YOUR have to realize there were THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE here before ONE THING THAT 'S GOING TO COME started .
THE SIDE STREETS COMING FROM PARKWOOD OVER ON TO KENNON STREET are THE PEOPLE THAT WAS DRIVING THROUGH BUYING DRUGS OR WHATEVER .
THE CRIME , THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEING IN THE SHAPE THAT IT 'S IN NOW is down now due to SOME OF THE THINGS that SOME OF THE THINGS done before YOUR even got here .
At least give US some type of - .
US 're not looking for A BIG REWARD , at least give US A TAX BREAK .
A BIG REWARD would be A BIG REWARD so that US would be able to keep US homes .
A LOT OF PEOPLE are not planning to keep-they know that THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE are not going to be able to keep THEIR OWN HOMES .
What does THE WAY FOR ME represent to YOU ?
THE WAY FOR ME represents a big part of YOUR life .
THE WAY FOR ME 's like something that YOUR parents did n't have when YOUR PARENTS were growing up or had AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT SOME FUNDS ASIDE TO CATCH UP WITH THE TAX .
YOUR PARENTS never owned A HOME .
YOUR PARENTS always were YOUR PARENTS .
MOST OF MY FRIENDS , MY FRIENDS own THEIR OWN HOMES and MOST OF MY FRIENDS 's like , to DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , when DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME became a home owner MOST OF MY FRIENDS was like a different step .
MOST OF MY FRIENDS made DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME feel like a different person .
YOUR have a whole different outlook on life .
YOUR feel better .
YOUR feel like YOUR 've accomplished something .
When YOUR pay YOUR mortgage YOUR feel like okay THIS will be mine sooner or later .
Maybe later , but at least YOUR MORTGAGE 's AN EFFORT .
YOUR MORTGAGE 's something to work hard at .
YOUR have to have something in life to work toward or THIS 'll get bored stiff really .
To DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME get bored easily .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME have to keep busy .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME have to constantly keep busy .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME ca n't sit .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME read then DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME get tired of reading , then DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME get bad about working on MY HOUSE .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME will paint this room one day then DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'll come back and change THE COLOR THE NEXT DAY .
SOME KIDS say , `` DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't know what color to expect in MY HOUSE . ''
SOME KIDS 's why DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME ca n't put drapes because ONE DAY ONE DAY 'll be green .
THE NEXT DAY THE NEXT DAY 'll be red .
THE NEXT DAY just depends whatever paint DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME find and DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME like THE COLOR .
THE NEXT DAY 's one part DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME like about being A HOMEOWNER .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can change MY PAINT .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can paint any color DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME want to paint .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can do whatever DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME want to do to MY PAINT .
Nobody has the right to say YOUR ca n't do MY PAINT to YOUR walls .
Or YOUR ca n't plant that in YOUR yard .
THE WAY FOR ME is THE WAY FOR ME .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME wish more people would think A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE .
A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE 's A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE .
Yeah .
A WAY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE makes YOUR AN INDIVIDUAL 'S .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't know .
THE HOMEOWNERS THAT WERE ALREADY HERE do n't usually stick out in THE WAY I THING IT SHOULD BE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT .
YOUR ca n't really ride through and tell who 's A HOMEOWNER and who 's a renter really .
THE WAY I THING IT SHOULD BE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 's THE WAY I THING IT SHOULD BE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT .
In THE PAST , THE HOMEOWNERS YOUR could tell because THE PAST , THE HOMEOWNERS was THE PAST , THE HOMEOWNERS .
YOUR could tell THE DIFFERENCE IN THEM .
Now THE DIFFERENCE IN THEM 's sort of hard .
Sometimes YOUR can put YOUR finger on some renters in THE NEIGHBORHOOD but then sometimes YOUR ca n't .
WE all are different .
Just by way of sort of wrapping up SARAH THUESEN wanted to ask YOU a few broad questions .
WE had talked about THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT A LITTLE BIT yesterday .
Some people would say that in 1968 , when MARTIN LUTHER KING was killed , THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT A LITTLE BIT ended .
Would YOU agree or disagree with THAT STATEMENT ?
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME disagree .
MARTIN LUTHER KING started THAT STATEMENT .
From MARTIN LUTHER KING starting THAT STATEMENT others took on .
THAT STATEMENT progressed afterwards .
THAT STATEMENT never will stop .
THAT STATEMENT 's going to always be progression in Civil Rights .
We are still fighting some of the same things that was in '68 are here now , but JUST A LITTLE BIT more hidden .
For THE LAST TWO YEARS , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 've been noticing a lot prejudice being shown out right .
THE LAST TWO YEARS 's not being hidden like THE LAST TWO YEARS used to be .
THE LAST TWO YEARS 's more obvious now .
They try to cover THE LAST TWO YEARS or pretty THE LAST TWO YEARS up but THE LAST TWO YEARS 's still some out there .
THE LAST TWO YEARS 's still THE LAST TWO YEARS .
Where do YOU notice prejudice most still today ?
SOME OF YOUR JOBS , SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYERS .
SOME OF YOUR JOBS , SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYERS . do n't actually come out and say SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYERS , but YOUR can look at SOME OF THE PROMOTIONAL TYPE THINGS that SOME OF THE PROMOTIONAL TYPE THINGS do within YOUR MORTGAGE COMPANY .
Then YOUR have the movies that are just average now on TV , RACIAL TYPE THINGS , THIS mainly .
Then in the school systems , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 've noticed .
SOME OF THE SCHOOLS are letting SOME KIDS read more racial material now .
We talk about maybe putting MORE BLACK HISTORY into THE SCHOOL , but MORE BLACK HISTORY 's more racial type things .
MORE BLACK HISTORY 's like THE OLD BOOKS WHAT THEY READ - .
SHAMARIO , MY GRANDSON , IN FACT is ONE OF THE ONE 'S THAT BROUGHT IT UP .
SHAMARIO , MY GRANDSON , IN FACT brought ONE OF THE ONE 'S THAT BROUGHT IT UP up to SHAMARIO , MY GRANDSON , IN FACT SHAMARIO , MY GRANDSON , IN FACT are reading now in school ?
Well , most of the books SOME read are racial .
ROLL OF THUNDER , HEAR MY CRY , SEA BISCUIT , TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD . -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- OH , AND THE HOLOCAUST .
So , ROLL OF THUNDER 's ROLL OF THUNDER that HEAR MY CRY , SEA BISCUIT , TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD . -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- OH , AND THE HOLOCAUST are having to go back and read HEAR MY CRY , SEA BISCUIT , TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD . -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- OH , AND THE HOLOCAUST .
Why would YOUR have to read HEAR MY CRY , SEA BISCUIT , TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD . -LSB- UNCLEAR -RSB- OH , AND THE HOLOCAUST now , where YOUR have all of this immigration stuff going on ? DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm thinking is THIS ANOTHER WAY to bring about uproar or uprising or something .
THIS ANOTHER WAY bothers DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME that MY CHILD is reading-I know HISTORY TYPE BOOKS are HISTORY TYPE BOOKS but at the same time DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think MY CHILD can read other things that were done that were n't so racial .
There are lots of nice books out there that are n't all racial .
-LSB- PAUSE -RSB-
These books that are being assigned in school do YOU think -LSB- PAUSE -RSB- 's possible that THEY are being assigned to stimulate dialogue about race ?
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think -LSB- PAUSE -RSB- 's more about THE DIALOGUE REALLY FOR THEM because than actually that AN ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR US was AN ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR US .
THE DIALOGUE REALLY FOR THEM is something like slang .
THIS ca n't relate to SOME OF THE WORD because SOME OF THE WORD 's written in-what do THIS call it-the off brand conversations DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME call SOME OF THE WORD and all this type of stuff .
THEY are teaching THIS a different language , like to speak a complete sentence .
Why go back and give THIS THESE OTHER WORDS TO TRY TO COMPREHEND ? He has a lot of problems trying to comprehend .
What does that MEAN , THOSE WORDS ? DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm like let DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME read MEAN , THOSE WORDS to YOUR because DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can talk like MEAN , THOSE WORDS .
Let DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME read MEAN , THOSE WORDS to YOUR so YOUR can comprehend MEAN , THOSE WORDS .
To DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME ca n't understand why THIS are reading THIS .
YOU wish YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN had more books that showed YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN positive images of African Americans , is that - ?
Yeah .
It is some positive stuff that we have done out there .
If YOUR want to give YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN that history , give YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN positive history , not something that every time A STUDENT says something out of ANOTHER WAY a white versus a black , oh YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN 's racist .
What else would YOUR think if YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN are reading these type books about racism ? Why would n't YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN go , `` THE WHOLE THING is racist .
YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN . ''
THE WHOLE THING is THE WHOLE THING that A STUDENT talks about THE WHOLE THING goes on at A STUDENT school .
THE WHOLE THING 's not right .
A LIFETIME THING
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME really think racism is going to be here forever .
A LIFETIME THING 's A LIFETIME THING .
A LIFETIME THING 's just A LIFETIME THING .
A LOT OF PEOPLE have learned to deal with A LOT OF PEOPLE and keep moving .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't feel like A LOT OF PEOPLE 's hindering - .
A LOT OF PEOPLE did n't hinder me any .
A LOT OF PEOPLE just made DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME stronger .
A LOT OF PEOPLE made DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME work harder to succeed in whatever DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME want to do .
What in YOU mind is the best way to teach that to SOME KIDS , to teach SOME KIDS how to move on ?
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think by reading positive material , giving SOME KIDS A POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE , letting SOME KIDS see other sides of life .
A POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE does n't have to be surrounding around a bunch of racist type things .
SOME KIDS are going to face A POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE anyway if SOME KIDS grow old .
SOME KIDS going to face A POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE one day .
The best thing for SOME KIDS is to employ SOME KIDS and let SOME KIDS know A GOAL is what has happened .
A GOAL is what can happen .
A GOAL 's okay to read HISTORY TYPE BOOKS , but let SOME KIDS see A GOAL is what some have done already .
A GOAL is what can be done .
A GOAL is reachable .
A GOAL is A GOAL that YOUR can achieve .
A GOAL does n't matter about where YOUR came from , how YOUR got here but A GOAL is A GOAL that YOUR can get to .
A lot of SOME KIDS like A GOAL .
SOME OF THE KIDS are confused .
SOME OF THE KIDS do n't know what SOME OF THE KIDS want to be when SOME OF THE KIDS grow up .
Well , if DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME be THIS then THIS wo n't give DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME THE WRONG ATTITUDE .
THE WRONG ATTITUDE 's THE WRONG ATTITUDE .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think YOUR PARENTS need to work harder on YOUR PARENTS children 's attitudes , impressing that THE WRONG ATTITUDE does n't matter about now .
Think about tomorrow .
YOUR tomorrows are not promised to YOUR , but at least YOUR TOMORROWS 's YOUR TOMORROWS .
YOUR TOMORROWS 's YOUR TOMORROWS .
YOUR TOMORROWS 's YOUR TOMORROWS .
We can dream .
Nobody can take YOUR TOMORROWS from YOUR , can they ?
What has most surprised YOU about how CHARLOTTE 'S changed in YOU lifetime ?
The fact that the buildings is multiplied , and the roads are still THE SAME .
The highways are still THE SAME .
THE PEOPLE , THE SAME has grew with population , the different groups of population .
THE SAME 's great .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME love THE SAME .
The lifestyle downtown is beginning to be horrendous .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 'm almost thinking DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME might need to move back to THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE ANIMALS AND HORSES .
THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE ANIMALS AND HORSES 's so busy , constantly busy , busy , busy , THE WHOLE TIME .
YOUR really do n't have anywhere to have privacy .
When DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME say PRIVACY-KIDS have to have room to grow .
If everything is hustle and bustle , CARS AND STUFF OF THAT NATURE parked , PRIVACY-KIDS ca n't ride bikes .
PRIVACY-KIDS ca n't ride motorcycles .
The dogs ca n't play because YOUR got THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE everywhere that IT sort of hinderous for THE WAY I THING IT SHOULD BE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT , to DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME unless everybody likes to live in a condo .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't think everybody likes condos .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME do n't .
To DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME , IT 's too confined .
Are there changes that YOU expected to see in CHARLOTTE 'S by NOW NOW have n't happened ?
Yeah , as far as I would love to see - . -LSB- interruption -RSB-
SARAH THUESEN was asking what changes YOU maybe expected to see by NOW in CHARLOTTE 'S and have n't .
Not really .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 've seen SOME IMPROVEMENT as far as the races .
SOME IMPROVEMENT has become to a level where THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE can move on .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 've seen that SOME IMPROVEMENT has happened and SOME IMPROVEMENT still continues to happen .
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE just have to work harder at being people instead of looking at people for A COLOR .
A COLOR 's just THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME look at THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE .
A COLOR does n't matter the color of YOUR skin or how YOUR talk .
Preferably if YOUR could speak English DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME can understand YOUR JUST A LITTLE BIT more .
If not , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME 've gotten to THE POINT WHERE I CAN UNDERSTAND SPANISH A LOT .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME ride A LOT OF THOSE ON MY BUS .
THOSE ON MY BUS are okay THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE being THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE .
If everybody would just be normal then A LOT OF THOSE ON MY BUS would probably be better .
Is CHARLOTTE 'S a better place for YOU grandchildren than CHARLOTTE 'S was when YOU were growing up here ?
Yes .
CHARLOTTE 'S has more to offer , much more to offer than when DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME was growing up here .
CHARLOTTE 'S was more solitude .
YOUR were confined more so to what YOUR could do and how YOUR could do CHARLOTTE 'S .
Now , CHARLOTTE 'S 's more open .
There 's a lot of stuff out there available to SOME KIDS and to THE NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE .
SOME KIDS just have to learn where THOSE RESOURCES are .
Well , is there anything that SARAH THUESEN have n't asked YOU that YOU wanted to talk about ?
NO WHERE , DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think we 've covered all of it .
Not too much .
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME .
Oh , one thing .
THEY need to add more black history .
To THE SCHOOL ?
To THE SCHOOL SYSTEM and THE SCHOOL SYSTEM needs to be more black history sections in OUR libraries , not all of the racist type .
THEY need to add more positive black history .
OUR do have SOME FAMOUS BLACK PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT NOTICED ENOUGH .
OUR know that SOME FAMOUS BLACK PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT NOTICED ENOUGH are there .
Do YOU remember being taught black history when YOU were going through school ? Did YOU teachers teach that ?
When DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME went through school there was no such thing as black history , none .
YOUR learned about LAFAYETTE , somebody that YOUR never knew but YOUR fell in love with because YOUR had to read about YOUR TEACHERS .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME never knew about black history , nothing about blacks .
THE ONLY THING I EVER KNEW was what DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME was singing and what DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME was told about .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME never read about any .
THE ONLY THING I EVER KNEW was never in THE SCHOOL SYSTEM .
YOU say what YOU were singing , did YOU learn THE ONLY THING WE COULD LEARN AS FAR AS BLACK HISTORY through music ?
YOU did .
THE ONLY THING WE COULD LEARN AS FAR AS BLACK HISTORY was THE ONLY THING WE COULD LEARN AS FAR AS BLACK HISTORY .
YOU did n't learn THE ONLY THING WE COULD LEARN AS FAR AS BLACK HISTORY in school .
They did n't play THE ONLY THING WE COULD LEARN AS FAR AS BLACK HISTORY in school .
YOU did THE ONLY THING WE COULD LEARN AS FAR AS BLACK HISTORY at home .
In church ?
In church .
In school it was all white history which was LAFAYETTE , -LSB- unclear -RSB- , and what was THE OTHER PEOPLE , Christopher Columbia , oh god .
THE SIDE STREETS COMING FROM PARKWOOD OVER ON TO KENNON STREET were the only people DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME knew about really , unless DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME went out AND-WHICH I DID .
YOUR PARENTS would tell DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME about other black type things .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME and MY FRIENDS would talk about AND-WHICH I DID .
As far as reading AND-WHICH I DID and seeing AND-WHICH I DID in THE SCHOOL .
But DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME think AND-WHICH I DID would be good .
NO WHERE started this thing talking about black history month .
DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME really do n't see THE POSITIVE PART about why one month .
Why not a whole year ? NO WHERE had history all year right .
Why ca n't THE POSITIVE PART be incorporated ? MAYBE not as much but maybe a little at a time to let SOME KIDS know there are some positive black history .
There were negative .
MAYBE knew all of the negative black history , so give MAYBE SOME POSITIVE BLACK HISTORY .
All of our history is not negative .
SOME POSITIVE BLACK HISTORY 's some positive stuff that we have accomplished .
SOME POSITIVE BLACK HISTORY seems like a good place to stop , a good note to end on .
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME . again .
Why , thank YOUR for having DIANE ENGLISH AT HER HOME .
