This is an interview with TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT .
Today is THE SECOND OF MARCH , 2006 .
THE SECOND OF MARCH , 2006 's about ten o'clock .
SARAH THUESEN name is SARAH THUESEN .
SARAH THUESEN 'm conducting this interview for the Southern Oral History Program at the University of NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL Hill , for OUR LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT initiative .
SARAH THUESEN thought before OUR got into YOUR work with LEGAL SERVICES , SARAH THUESEN 'd like to hear JUST A LITTLE BIT about YOUR background , YOUR childhood .
Tell SARAH THUESEN JUST A LITTLE BIT about growing up in ALABAMA .
Where were YOUR born in ALABAMA ?
In MOBILE .
Did YOUR live there until YOUR went away to college ?
Yes , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did .
Tell SARAH THUESEN a little bit about YOUR parents .
What did ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY do ?
Well , MY MOTHER 'S was MY MOTHER 'S and MY FATHER ran A SMALL STEAMSHIP AGENCY , A SMALL STEAMSHIP AGENCY .
Tell SARAH THUESEN a little bit about the schools YOUR attended .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT went to an ordinary elementary school in the public school system and then in junior and senior high , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT attended a local day military school , called UNIVERSITY MILITARY SCHOOL , in MOBILE .
What was that THAT EXPERIENCE ?
Well , THAT EXPERIENCE was fairly intense for TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT .
THAT EXPERIENCE was very important in some respects .
THAT EXPERIENCE helped TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT get a fairly good education in some ways .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT went on the debate team and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that helped TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT become a public speaker and ultimately , got TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT somewhat interested in LAW SCHOOL .
It was also a severely conservative environment and , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , very racially conservative , and very authoritarian .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT never had a great deal of interest in joining the military after having experienced the arbitrary powers exercised over YOUNG MEN IN THAT SCHOOL .
What year were YOUR born ?
1945 .
So YOUR would have been growing up in THE EARLY CIVIL RIGHTS ERA .
Yes .
How did THE EARLY CIVIL RIGHTS ERA affect YOUR worldview ?
Well , we were very sheltered from the immediate parts of LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , because most of the important things in the early 1960s were going on in MONTGOMERY and BIRMINGHAM and in the rural black belt area outside of MONTGOMERY .
For THE MOST PART , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was largely unaware of THE MOST PART .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT can vaguely recall being at A VERY PROVOKING QUESTION FOR ME in BIRMINGHAM and seeing THE POLICE take DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON , but TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did not understand what THE POLICE was doing and why they were arresting THE POLICE and the importance of that at THE TIME .
A VERY PROVOKING QUESTION FOR ME 's just because TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was in A VERY SHELTERED , A VERY SHELTERED , for THE MOST PART .
A VERY PROVOKING QUESTION FOR ME was n't until TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT went to some international Key Club conventions , where there were a lot of NORTHERN KIDS that were more aware of LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT than WE were , THAT QUESTIONS came up about how WE could tolerate racially-segregated schools .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT thought A VERY PROVOKING QUESTION FOR ME was A VERY PROVOKING QUESTION FOR ME .
Of course , it was something that ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY had basically engineered without TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT knowledge of A VERY PROVOKING QUESTION FOR ME .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was largely unaware of what was going on in A SERIOUS WAY until TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT got to college .
SARAH THUESEN 'm curious , when YOUR interacted with NORTHERN KIDS from the North and NORTHERN KIDS asked YOUR about the justification for segregated schools , what at THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY would YOUR have said , do YOUR think ?
Well , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did n't HAVE-I FRANKLY WAS VERY AMBIVALENT about HAVE-I FRANKLY WAS VERY AMBIVALENT .
WE had CANDIDATES FROM ALABAMA THAT WERE RUNNING FOR THESE INTERNATIONAL OFFICES and WE were preparing CANDIDATES FROM ALABAMA THAT WERE RUNNING FOR THESE INTERNATIONAL OFFICES to answer THAT QUESTIONS in these political debates for the office .
WE standard line that was developed by some of the older people was OUR STANDARD LINE THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY SOME OF THE OLDER PEOPLE .
So OUR STANDARD LINE THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY SOME OF THE OLDER PEOPLE was OUR STANDARD LINE THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY SOME OF THE OLDER PEOPLE .
Other than hearing that PAT ANSWER , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did not understand THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT certainly did n't understand what the fourteenth amendment might mean .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did n't understand what THE BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION DECISION meant and THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT .
There was no desegregation lawsuit going on in THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
There was n't an attempt to integrate the public schools in MOBILE until the late 1970s , after TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was finished with college .
So , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did n't really learn much about what was going on until TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT really left ALABAMA .
YOUR mentioned the THE BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION DECISION decision .
Do YOUR remember when THAT RULING came down ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did not have any real awareness of THAT RULING .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think THE FIRST AWARENESS I HAD ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON was watching ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY watch THE NATIONAL GUARD enforce the school integration in Little Rock , Arkansas on television .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think THE FIRST AWARENESS I HAD ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON 's what precipitated ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY decision to take TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT out of the public schools in 1957 and enroll TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT in a racially-segregated military school , because TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY thought that if 1957 was happening in Little Rock , that 1957 would be in MOBILE soon thereafter .
What was THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY ?
THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY was called UNIVERSITY MILITARY SCHOOL .
Is THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY still around ?
THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY is .
And fortunately , THEY have demilitarized THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY and combined THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY with the private girls ' school that was sort of THEY counterpart in another part of town .
Now all the military uniforms are gone .
Getting on a slightly different topic , YOUR were talking about YOUR racial awareness at that age .
Do YOUR remember any incidents or just general memories about when YOUR became as A CHILD OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CLASSES , rich and poor ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT remember the most vivid memory TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT have is AT THE TIME .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT remember WE were driving in MY MOTHER 'S old Lincoln Continental down an unpaved road by these completely run-down shacks .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT saw THESE LITTLE BLACK KIDS with no shoes walking around with very little clothes on and staring at WE , like WE were on SOME KIND OF A GOLDEN CHARIOT .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did n't fully understand SOME KIND OF A GOLDEN CHARIOT , but TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT emotional sense of SOME KIND OF A GOLDEN CHARIOT was THESE LITTLE BLACK KIDS must think that WE are extremely privileged and somehow , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT felt bad about SOME KIND OF A GOLDEN CHARIOT .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT felt somewhat ashamed .
And then TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT watched TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT mother drop THIS HOUSEKEEPER off in front of HER HOUSE and saw about THREE or FOUR NORTHERN KIDS run up to THIS HOUSEKEEPER and realized that when THIS HOUSEKEEPER was gone , there was nobody there to take care of THIS HOUSEKEEPER kids .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT still have THAT MEMORY PRETTY VIVID IN MY MIND .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was too young to ask any intelligent questions about THAT MEMORY PRETTY VIVID IN MY MIND , but TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT never lost that memory .
Did YOUR , AT THE TIME , see the class divide as somewhat similar to the race divide , or were YOUR also aware of CLASS DIFFERENCES AMONG WHITES ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was not that aware of CLASS DIFFERENCES AMONG WHITES .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that CLASS DIFFERENCES AMONG WHITES was because the lower-income white folks mostly lived out in other rural parts outside of THE CITY OF MOBILE , very similar to what we have here in METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE , frankly .
The poor people in THE CITY OF MOBILE were ALMOST ALL AFRICAN-AMERICAN .
And so there was a heavy coincidence of class and race as far as TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT could tell .
Then when TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT got into college and became much more aware of the issues and worked for an antipoverty agency after TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT junior year in college , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was much more acutely aware of how GREAT THE OVERLAP of poverty and race , that is African-Americans , was in that community .
When TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was in elementary school , there were very few poor white kids in LAW SCHOOL .
So YOUR family always lived right in town in MOBILE ?
Well , actually not .
THE FIRST NINE YEARS OF MY LIFE , WE lived in town and then the THE SECOND OF MARCH , 2006 nine years , WE lived out in what was THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME , but THE FIRST NINE YEARS OF MY LIFE later became incorporated in the city limits .
THE FIRST NINE YEARS OF MY LIFE was out about seven or EIGHT miles from the center of downtown .
So YOUR decided to attend college at DUKE UNIVERSITY , right ?
DUKE UNIVERSITY 's right .
What made YOUR decide to head somewhat north for college ?
Well , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that DUKE UNIVERSITY was DUKE UNIVERSITY .
MY GERMAN TEACHER , who was also the debate team sponsor , had taken us around to debate tournaments throughout THE SOUTH , and to Vanderbilt and Tulane and OTHER PLACES .
MY GERMAN TEACHER strongly encouraged some of the better students to leave THE STATE OF ALABAMA .
THE TWO VALEDICTORIANS IN THE CLASSES AHEAD OF ME had both gone to DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT knew THE TWO VALEDICTORIANS IN THE CLASSES AHEAD OF ME fairly well .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT also knew that THE TWO VALEDICTORIANS IN THE CLASSES AHEAD OF ME had applied to Ivy League schools and had not been accepted .
When TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT applied to DARTMOUTH , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think DARTMOUTH was DARTMOUTH , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was not accepted .
So , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that at THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY , DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK was probably considered the best school that THE GOOD PEOPLE could attend , from MOBILE anyway .
What years were YOUR there ?
1964 through ' 68 .
So at the peak of the civil rights years .
What do YOUR remember about the civil rights atmosphere in the CHAPEL HILL area ?
Well , there was quite a bit going on , at least at DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did not perceive that much going on in CHAPEL HILL , but TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT also was not there very much .
But DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK had an amazing array of speakers that came to A VERY EMOTIONALLY ELECTRIC TIME from various parts of LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT .
A PRETTY IMPORTANT LIFE-CHANGING EVENT FOR ME was DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON , when TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT attended DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON speech and A PRETTY IMPORTANT LIFE-CHANGING EVENT FOR ME was A PRETTY IMPORTANT LIFE-CHANGING EVENT FOR ME .
Because DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON was not only eloquent , DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON was able to give THE DETAILS about what LIVING IN A SEGREGATED SOCIETY IN THE DEEP SOUTH meant on a daily basis for THE BLACK PEOPLE .
LIVING IN A SEGREGATED SOCIETY IN THE DEEP SOUTH was more than just the symbolic injustices of the separate water fountains and the separate schools .
It was the inability to get sufficient education and money to be able to live productive lives , to participate in THE POLITICAL SYSTEM , and to be free from arbitrary police force , which was still the most important aspect .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT mean the sheer force and violence of police activity in concert with private violence by the Klu Klux Klan or other groups was undeniable , unchecked by the whole power structure in the states of ALABAMA and MISSISSIPPI .
After hearing about DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON , there were OTHER PEOPLE , STUDENTS WHO WENT TO DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK AND GAVE TALKS AND WORKSHOPS THAT REVEALED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM .
It was pretty evident that WHITE PEOPLE WHO ACTED IN CONCERT WITH THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS were just as much at risk , physically at risk , as THE BLACK PEOPLE .
In SOME WAYS , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think WHITE PEOPLE WHO ACTED IN CONCERT WITH THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS were maybe more at risk , because WHITE PEOPLE WHO ACTED IN CONCERT WITH THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS were viewed as betraying the presumed racial pride that a lot of WHITE PEOPLE WHO ACTED IN CONCERT WITH THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS were supposed to have , by participating in CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVITIES .
WHITE PEOPLE WHO ACTED IN CONCERT WITH THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS were viewed as being traitors .
As YOUR were gaining A NEW HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF ISSUES OF RACE while YOUR 're in college , what was A NEW HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF ISSUES OF RACE like going back home ?
Well , it was very interesting , particularly trying to talk with ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT other relatives .
Although ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY , ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY were not ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY were what TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT would consider more passive racists .
ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY viewed THE STATE OF THE RACIAL POWER RELATIONSHIPS as being something that was given , THE RACIAL POWER RELATIONSHIPS was wrong , but unchangeable , and that PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD were stupid or taking bad risks .
THE STATE OF THE RACIAL POWER RELATIONSHIPS made ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY worry that TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was interested in some of CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVITIES .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT can certainly remember a lot of very heated discussions at the dinner table that would rival anything that was in the TV sitcom called All in THE FAMILY .
We basically just disagreed about everything politically , about the Vietnam War , about LONG CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , about the War on Poverty , the role of President -LSB- Lyndon -RSB- Johnson .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT can still remember watching live THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION in Chicago when THE POLICE turned on THESE PROTESTORS and beat the pulp out of THESE PROTESTORS .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT said , `` THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 's THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION . ''
MY FATHER , who had just watched THE SAME THING I SAW , said , `` What police brutality ? '' So then TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT began to understand how PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD viewed the same occurrences very differently from the filter lens of PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD value system , as to even what happened .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had never really understood that before .
But TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that became very important later as TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT began to try to understand politics and lawyering .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT also remember that in TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT senior after the assassination of DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON , there was a great outpouring of distress and anger on the Duke campus .
THE BLACK EMPLOYEES ' union , that represented all the non-academic employees , decided to go on A STRIKE and ask OTHER PEOPLE , STUDENTS WHO WENT TO DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK AND GAVE TALKS AND WORKSHOPS THAT REVEALED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM to join in A STRIKE and to shut down DUKE UNIVERSITY .
This was in April of TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT senior year .
So right after DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON was killed ?
Right after DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AWAY IN A POLICE WAGON was killed .
THE SAME THING I SAW happened at COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY and there was some national media about COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY .
But TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think unrelated to THE SAME THING I SAW , there were just SOME PEOPLE AT DUKE THAT THOUGHT , `` WELL , THIS IS THE MOMENT TO TRY TO BRING THE UNIVERSITY 'S INJUSTICE TO LIGHT AND TO TRY TO GET THE BLACK EMPLOYEES ' UNION RECOGNIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY AND HAVE THEM PAY BETTER WAGES . ''
And A SERIOUS WAY was A SERIOUS WAY , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , channeling the emotions of THE TIME into a concrete form of action .
What A SERIOUS WAY did was A SERIOUS WAY divided THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS on campus , because THOSE OF US THAT WANTED TO SUPPORT THE UNION AND SHUT DOWN THE UNIVERSITY were doing so at A TIME WHEN THEIR FINAL EXAMS AND THEIR LAST PAPERS WERE BECOMING DUE .
So there was THE FIRST REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION right there that was very personal : Were US jeopardizing US chances of graduating from DUKE UNIVERSITY , from being expelled from DUKE UNIVERSITY ? Then for YOUNG MEN IN THAT SCHOOL , that meant : Would US be reclassified by the selective service system 1A and drafted ? All of those were PRETTY IMPORTANT ISSUES and for TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT , THE FIRST REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION was THE FIRST REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION to make of whether TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 'm willing to make that kind of risk because of the importance of the political issue .
When TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT told ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY that TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was going to join A STRIKE , ACTIVE RACISTS IN ANY WAY thought TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was crazy .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was also TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT and when TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT told THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS in A VERY IMPORTANT TIME that A VERY IMPORTANT TIME 's what TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was doing , THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS thought TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was crazy .
But A VERY IMPORTANT TIME was A VERY IMPORTANT TIME and there was some very important national speakers that came .
Joan Baez came and other people came to support A STRIKE .
A LOT OF THE FACULTY supported A LOT OF THE FACULTY .
What ended up happening is that most of A FEW VERY BRIGHT AND INSIGHTFUL PROFESSORS IN HIGH SCHOOL accommodated A STRIKE by letting US write THEIR LAST PAPERS in lieu of THEIR FINAL EXAMS .
So US were out there in AN IMPORTANT LOCAL POLITICAL EVENT for several weeks .
AN IMPORTANT LOCAL POLITICAL EVENT was AN IMPORTANT LOCAL POLITICAL EVENT .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT also remember THE NATIONAL GUARD had helicopters that were circling A VERY EMOTIONALLY ELECTRIC TIME .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that THEY did n't know whether there was going to be some kind of riot going on because of THEY .
There were VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that A VERY EMOTIONALLY ELECTRIC TIME was A VERY EMOTIONALLY ELECTRIC TIME .
How was A STRIKE resolved by the time YOUR graduated ?
A STRIKE was resolved by DUKE UNIVERSITY , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT believe TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT remember , making an increase in BETTER WAGES , but not formally recognizing THE BLACK EMPLOYEES ' UNION RECOGNIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY .
So A STRIKE was somewhat of a compromise that THE BLACK EMPLOYEES ' UNION RECOGNIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY decided to accept , because VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE thought VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE had made progress and VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE knew that when OTHER PEOPLE , STUDENTS WHO WENT TO DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK AND GAVE TALKS AND WORKSHOPS THAT REVEALED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM left for the season , OTHER PEOPLE , STUDENTS WHO WENT TO DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK AND GAVE TALKS AND WORKSHOPS THAT REVEALED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM probably would n't have that much leverage .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was not ONE OF THE NEGOTIATORS , so TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was not privileged to THE INSIDE VIEW OF IT .
But ONE OF THE NEGOTIATORS 's ONE OF THE NEGOTIATORS .
Then did YOUR go straight from DUKE WHO HAD GONE TO THE SELMA MARCH AND CAME BACK to law school in BOSTON ?
NO , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT joined VISTA , the Volunteers in Service to AMERICA PROGRAM , which was what NO called the domestic Peace Corps .
So about three weeks after TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT graduated , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT packed up and moved to THE ROXBURY COMMUNITY in BOSTON to undergo training .
YOUR worked for VISTA for A YEAR was A YEAR ?
Actually TWO YEARS .
Tell SARAH THUESEN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE .
Well , A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE certainly did educate TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT about what had happened in the northern urban centers with respect to LEADERSHIP .
THE ROXBURY COMMUNITY had become very radicalized in leadership over a number of issues , THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION being one of the main ones .
THE ROXBURY COMMUNITY was evident from the day I arrived that BOSTON was polarized racially in a way that was even greater than what TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had observed in ALABAMA .
What TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT mean by THE ROXBURY COMMUNITY is all the police appeared to be white Irish and they patrolled ROXBURY , -LSB- MASSACHUSETTS -RSB- with these large batons and large German shepherds .
There were a lot of VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE that wore dashikis and VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE were into a lot of the black separatist rhetoric .
VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE were attempting to create VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE own community institutions that were independent of city government , and trying to fight various forms of URBAN RENEWAL AND OTHER CITY PROGRAMS that would displace any low-income black people .
VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE had very little interest or tolerance for white liberal people wanting to help or being present .
So even the VISTA class that was brought in VERY FIERY LOCAL BLACK LEADERS THAT CAME TO THE CAMPUS TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS AND SUPPORT THE STRIKE had probably fifteen to eighteen young people , mostly college grads , that were three-fourths white , became an issue for the black-controlled community antipoverty agency .
So for THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE , the validity of TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT presence and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT interest in providing some kind of help was questioned purely on the basis of TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT status as a white person .
THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE had never happened to TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT .
THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE never occurred to TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT that there was anything wrong with TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT just because of what TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT looked like or how TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT talked .
But it was AN IMMEDIATE ISSUE WHEN I GOT THERE .
AN IMMEDIATE ISSUE WHEN I GOT THERE became then very interesting to see where WE were allowed to be trained , what organizations were willing to accept white VISTA volunteers .
And it turned out that most of the indigenous black organizations in ROXBURY , -LSB- MASSACHUSETTS -RSB- were unwilling to take any VISTA volunteers .
MOST OF US were placed with AN ORGANIZED called the Massachusetts Welfare Rights Organization , which was THE ORGANIZATION THAT ATTEMPTED TO ORGANIZE WELFARE RECIPIENTS , who were almost totally black in BOSTON , to develop economic power through NUMBERS .
MOST OF US 's where most of the VISTAs were placed and AN ORGANIZED were black and white .
AN ORGANIZED were accepted because the national organization was led by a former chemistry professor who was glad to have cheap organizers from anywhere .
AN ORGANIZED 's what VISTA provided .
THE NATIONAL WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION was THE NATIONAL WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION that the -LSB- MASSACHUSETTS branch was affiliated with ?
THE NATIONAL WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION 's right .
Did YOUR have SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WORKING WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR SKEPTICISM ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT ?
Generally not .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WORKING WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR SKEPTICISM ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT 's probably fairly understandable , because number one , most of AFRICAN-AMERICAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR SKEPTICISM ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT had never had anybody interested in helping AFRICAN-AMERICAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR SKEPTICISM ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT deal with AFRICAN-AMERICAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR SKEPTICISM ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT very difficult challenges with AFRICAN-AMERICAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR SKEPTICISM ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT lack of income , lack of clothing and food , insensitive landlords .
And having COLLEGE-EDUCATED PEOPLE show COLLEGE-EDUCATED PEOPLE how COLLEGE-EDUCATED PEOPLE could use THE LEGAL SYSTEM in a way to get COLLEGE-EDUCATED PEOPLE basic things COLLEGE-EDUCATED PEOPLE wanted was a victory in COLLEGE-EDUCATED PEOPLE minds .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think COLLEGE-EDUCATED PEOPLE largely appreciated that .
What do YOUR feel like YOUR and the other VISTA workers were able to accomplish through YOUR WORK ?
Well , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think there were some obvious short-term victories in that YOU AND THE OTHER VISTA WORKERS got a lot of PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD , that PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD needed for PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD survival .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that a lot of PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD learned about power and politics for THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE .
PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD learned that , by organizing and acting in NUMBERS , that PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD could change the psychological balance of power somewhat with the social workers in THE WELFARE SYSTEM .
Prior to the organization coming , PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD did n't have any idea what THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS were , how PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD could get PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD , and PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD were pretty much subject to whatever the personality whims of THE SOCIAL WORKER ASSIGNED TO THEM happened to be .
If PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD did n't get along with THE SOCIAL WORKER ASSIGNED TO THEM , PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD were n't going to know that PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD could get clothes for THEIR KIDS TO SLEEP ON in the winter or furniture to have beds for THEIR KIDS TO SLEEP ON .
There were plenty of MORE POOR WHITE PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE OF BOSTON that TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT found were totally powerless and essentially blamed MORE POOR WHITE PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE OF BOSTON for everything that was going wrong .
So TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT learned A LOT about the psychology of POWERLESS PEOPLE and how POWERLESS PEOPLE could somewhat change with an organizational framework .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't know how long those lessons lasted when THE ORGANIZATION THAT ATTEMPTED TO ORGANIZE WELFARE RECIPIENTS was essentially destroyed about 1970 by THE GOVERNOR CHANGING THE WELFARE SYSTEM SO THAT INDIVIDUALIZED NEEDS COULD NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED .
THE WELFARE SYSTEM went to what was called a `` flat grant '' system where the amount of assistance became purely a mathematical function of the number of people in the household .
If YOU had THREE kids and one parent , YOU got A FLAT AMOUNT OF MONEY and if A FLAT AMOUNT OF MONEY was not enough , A FLAT AMOUNT OF MONEY did n't matter .
So there was n't anything left to organize SOME PEOPLE AT DUKE THAT THOUGHT , `` WELL , THIS IS THE MOMENT TO TRY TO BRING THE UNIVERSITY 'S INJUSTICE TO LIGHT AND TO TRY TO GET THE BLACK EMPLOYEES ' UNION RECOGNIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY AND HAVE THEM PAY BETTER WAGES .
About twelve months after SOME PEOPLE AT DUKE THAT THOUGHT , `` WELL , THIS IS THE MOMENT TO TRY TO BRING THE UNIVERSITY 'S INJUSTICE TO LIGHT AND TO TRY TO GET THE BLACK EMPLOYEES ' UNION RECOGNIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY AND HAVE THEM PAY BETTER WAGES , all the organizations fell apart .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think some of SOME PEOPLE AT DUKE THAT THOUGHT , `` WELL , THIS IS THE MOMENT TO TRY TO BRING THE UNIVERSITY 'S INJUSTICE TO LIGHT AND TO TRY TO GET THE BLACK EMPLOYEES ' UNION RECOGNIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY AND HAVE THEM PAY BETTER WAGES were reincarnated later by ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FOR REFORM NOW -LSB- ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FOR REFORM NOW -RSB- , because the head organizer for the Mass. .
THE NATIONAL WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION was THE GUY THAT WENT TO ARKANSAS AND FORMED ACORN .
What was THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY ?
THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY is Wade Rathke .
So were YOUR still working for THE ORGANIZATION AT THE POINT that THE ORGANIZATION AT THE POINT started to fall apart ?
Actually , NO .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had decided to go to LAW SCHOOL .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had sort of made a decision that TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was not that well suited to be an organizer for a career .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had been accepted at LAW SCHOOL IN 1968 and now LAW SCHOOL IN 1968 was 1970 .
The situation with the draft had changed and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was willing to take the risk of going to LAW SCHOOL at THE POINT .
Did YOUR see moving toward a law degree as a fairly sharp departure from YOUR activist career or were YOUR thinking about combining the two in some fashion ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT 'm not sure that TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT thought about combining them so much as TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT saw how THE LAWYERS were A CRITICAL PART OF SUPPORTING LOW-INCOME PEOPLES ' ORGANIZATIONS .
WE did have THE LAWYERS .
There was A VISTA LAWYER WHO WAS ASSIGNED TO REPRESENT THE WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION .
A VISTA LAWYER WHO WAS ASSIGNED TO REPRESENT THE WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION ability to advise WE strategically was essential in TERMS OF KNOWING WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO AND TRYING TO GET US OUT OF TROUBLE , EVEN WHEN WE DID WHAT WE THOUGHT was right .
So TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had A GOOD CHANCE TO SEE HOW THAT WORKED WHILE I WAS ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS .
Then A GOOD CHANCE TO SEE HOW THAT WORKED WHILE I WAS ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS was of course , fairly evident that THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYERS WHO HAD WORKED WITH THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE AND SNCC AND OTHER PEOPLE DOWN IN ALABAMA , had played A CRITICAL ROLE in making some of those grassroots organizational efforts work .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT learned later that had THE LAWYERS not been able to sue the city of Montgomery regarding the segregated bus system , the original MONTGOMERY bus boycott probably would have failed .
But going to federal district court and getting an injunction was the key to the ultimate victory in making that happen .
That lesson was not lost on TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think the other thing is TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT learned that if YOU do n't have access to THE POLITICAL SYSTEM or THE LEGAL SYSTEM , THE POLITICAL SYSTEM will learn how to co-opt or shut down grassroots movements .
-LSB- MASSACHUSETTS had the biggest grassroots welfare rights organization in THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME and after two years of enormous success in organizing over seventy local organizations , including about EIGHT really big ones in the city of BOSTON , -LSB- MASSACHUSETTS was completely demolished with one legal stroke by THE GOVERNOR CHANGING THE WELFARE SYSTEM SO THAT INDIVIDUALIZED NEEDS COULD NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED , that was not challengeable .
Who was the governor at THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY ?
Francis Sargent .
So YOUR began LAW SCHOOL at BOSTON UNIVERSITY in 19 -
' 70 .
At THE POINT , were YOUR already anticipating the types of law YOUR wanted to get into ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT thought THE POINT would be what TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT used to call THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS , which had A FAIRLY WIDE SPECTRUM to A FAIRLY WIDE SPECTRUM .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did n't know whether THE POINT would involve community organizations , poverty organizations , race discrimination , or labor .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was still learning about A WHOLE LOT OF ASPECTS .
But TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT knew that A WHOLE LOT OF ASPECTS would have something to do with troublemaking and change ; TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT knew that much .
Troublemaking on YOUR part ?
Well , the trouble was being made .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was just going to be ONE OF THE ENGINEERS that tried to either improve ONE OF THE ENGINEERS or protect ONE OF THE ENGINEERS or whatever ONE OF THE ENGINEERS was .
In TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT first year , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was working for a campus organization called the Civil Rights Research Council .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT decided to bring ANGELA DAVIS 'S lawyer to the campus to talk .
If there was anybody that was well-known for troublemaking at THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY , ANGELA DAVIS 'S was pretty high .
ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER had been a graduate of BOSTON UNIVERSITY and was an ALMOST ALL AFRICAN-AMERICAN and had been in Atlanta for twenty years or so .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT thought ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER was ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER .
What was THE NAME OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't remember .
1971 would have been THE EARLY 70S ?
Yeah , 1971 was probably 1971 .
So how did YOUR make 1971 back down to NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL after YOUR finished LAW SCHOOL ?
Well , that same organization was part of a national network that somehow connected LAW STUDENTS with THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYERS WHO HAD WORKED WITH THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE AND SNCC AND OTHER PEOPLE DOWN IN ALABAMA all over THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME .
Most of LAW STUDENTS were in THE SOUTH and the woman that was the head of THE ORGANIZATION THAT ATTEMPTED TO ORGANIZE WELFARE RECIPIENTS selected TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT to be matched up with THE ACLU -LSB- AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION -RSB- LAWYER in METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE .
So after MY FIRST YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT came to METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE to work for THE ACLU -LSB- AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION -RSB- LAWYER .
LAW STUDENTS gave a healthy stipend of fifty dollars a week to live on , which was the same amount LAW STUDENTS paid in VISTA .
By THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had learned a lot about poverty .
How long did YOUR work with THE ACLU -LSB- AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION -RSB- LAWYER ?
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION was just for one THAT SUMMER .
And AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION was right after LAW SCHOOL ?
NO , NO was after MY FIRST YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL .
So TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT still had TWO more years of school to go after TWO .
TWO MORE YEARS OF SCHOOL TO GO AFTER THAT was TWO MORE YEARS OF SCHOOL TO GO AFTER THAT , because TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT got to come to A COMMUNITY and see what difference a courageous federal district court judge could make .
We had the best one in THE SOUTH .
ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER had numerous cases with ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER and ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER let TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT argue AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR ME in FRONT OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE AS A FIRST-YEAR LAW STUDENT .
AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR ME was AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR ME .
Just to clarify , JUDGE MCMILLAN is JUDGE MCMILLAN ?
Yes .
And who was ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER ?
George Daly .
What did THE CASE involve that YOUR worked on THAT SUMMER ?
It was an attempt to consolidate FOUR or five individual suits against the city police for THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION in violation of the Civil Rights Act .
A BIG STRATEGIC QUESTION was whether or not it was proper to join all of those suits into ONE BIG SUIT , versus leaving THEM as separate cases to be tried individually .
So A BIG STRATEGIC QUESTION was A BIG STRATEGIC QUESTION .
What was THE UPSHOT OF THAT CASE ?
Well , THE UPSHOT OF THAT CASE was that JUDGE MCMILLAN denied THEM , WHICH SURPRISED ME GREATLY AND SURPRISED THE LAWYER motion to combine THEM , which surprised TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT greatly and surprised ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER .
But ANGELA DAVIS 'S LAWYER later explained to TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT that the reason JUDGE MCMILLAN must have denied OUR MOTION TO COMBINE THEM , WHICH SURPRISED ME GREATLY AND SURPRISED THE LAWYER is because THEM , WHICH SURPRISED ME GREATLY AND SURPRISED THE LAWYER had made a stupid strategic decision to join THEM .
JUDGE MCMILLAN was actually probably making a better decision , strategic decision , because one of the four victims had been A DRUG DEALER and A DRUG DEALER had shot at THE POLICEMEN before THE POLICEMEN shot and paralyzed A DRUG DEALER .
The lawyer TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT worked for realized in retrospect that if THE CASE had been THE CASE , that THE THREE OTHER VICTIMS , who were much more sympathetic and innocent-looking , probably would have lost , because THE THREE OTHER VICTIMS would have been guilty by association with the drug dealer who was the fourth plaintiff .
So JUDGE MCMILLAN was sympathetic with YOUR cause in fact , even though initially YOUR CAUSE appeared otherwise ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think so , not that JUDGE MCMILLAN said YOUR CAUSE in any of those kinds of TERMS OF KNOWING WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO AND TRYING TO GET US OUT OF TROUBLE , EVEN WHEN WE DID WHAT WE THOUGHT .
JUDGE MCMILLAN just did what JUDGE MCMILLAN thought was the right thing , even though we probably had a good legal argument to combine THE THREE OTHER VICTIMS .
So TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT learned A LOT from A LOT .
During THAT SUMMER , was this the FIRST time YOUR had ever spent any significant time in METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE ?
Yes .
Did THAT SUMMER strike YOUR as a place YOUR might want to return to ?
THAT SUMMER did , just because of THE GOOD PEOPLE and the good relationships .
There were very interesting and FUN YOUNG PEOPLE , THE LAWYERS , PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD that worked for THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER .
One of my friends already worked for THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER and so TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT sort of met some of FUN YOUNG PEOPLE at the same time .
Any individuals stand out in particular YOUR met that really made an impression on YOUR ?
Well sure .
FRYE GAILLARD , FRYE GAILLARD , was A YOUNG REPORTER WHO WAS COVERING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM and so A YOUNG REPORTER WHO WAS COVERING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM had a lot of interesting things .
One of his best friends was Doug Marlette , who was the cartoonist .
Then SOME OF THE PEOPLE TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT lived with , like Marvin Sparrow , who was one of the leaders of the counterculture group .
To THE EXTENT THAT THERE WAS ANY ANTIWAR PROTESTS OR CIVIL RIGHTS PROTESTS OR ANYTHING IN THAT REGARD , SOME OF THE PEOPLE was going to be in the middle of THE EXTENT THAT THERE WAS ANY ANTIWAR PROTESTS OR CIVIL RIGHTS PROTESTS OR ANYTHING IN THAT REGARD .
And YOUR lived with SOME OF THE PEOPLE that THAT SUMMER ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did .
Did TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT sweep YOUR up in any protests ?
SOME OF THE PEOPLE did n't sweep TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT up in THEM , but THEM had begun to-they were having meetings in A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY .
But A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY 's A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY .
So THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION BATTLE was fairly intense at A TIME WHEN THEIR FINAL EXAMS AND THEIR LAST PAPERS WERE BECOMING DUE .
THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION BATTLE was , although THAT SUMMER OF 1971 was THAT SUMMER OF 1971 .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT ca n't remember whether THE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION BATTLE had been announced before TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT got there or not .
But during THE SUMMER MONTHS , there was nothing particularly evident to TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT about THE SUMMER MONTHS .
More of THE SUMMER MONTHS occurred in 1972 while TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was back at school .
When THE JUDGES ' ORIGINAL INTEGRATION ORDER was being implemented , THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS A LOT OF THE SO-CALLED RIOTS AND FIGHTS were going in THE SCHOOL SYSTEM , WHICH RESULTED IN MASSIVE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS BEING TAKEN AGAINST VIRTUALLY ONLY THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN KIDS , WHICH THEN RESULTED IN ANOTHER LAWSUIT BY THE LEGAL AID OFFICE AT THAT TIME AGAINST THE SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR HAVING NO PROCEDURAL RULES FOR SUSPENDING KIDS FROM SCHOOL , WHICH WAS AN IMPORTANT CASE , AGAIN DECIDED BY JUDGE MCMILLAN .
Were YOUR reading about all that back in BOSTON ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did n't read about BOSTON actually until TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT came here in 1973 to start work .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did read about some things and kept in touch with GEORGE DALY ABOUT SOME OF HIS CIVIL RIGHTS CASES that TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had worked on .
But TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT own other things to do .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT did have to study and work at the Legal Office in Chinatown in BOSTON too .
So TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had plenty to do .
Sure .
So how did YOUR come to work for GREAT THE OVERLAP , at the time GREAT THE OVERLAP was called THE MECKLENBURG COUNTY LEGAL AID SOCIETY ?
GREAT THE OVERLAP was called THE MECKLENBURG COUNTY LEGAL AID SOCIETY .
Okay .
And YOUR came here in '73 THEN ?
'73 THEN 's right .
Right after LAW SCHOOL .
LAW SCHOOL 's right .
How did YOUR make THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT UPHELD THE JUDGES ' ORIGINAL INTEGRATION ORDER FROM 1969 to come here ?
Well , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT made THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT UPHELD THE JUDGES ' ORIGINAL INTEGRATION ORDER FROM 1969 obliquely .
Originally , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had interviewed at FOUR places in NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had decided NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL was going to be where TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT would locate and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT signed up to take THE BAR EXAM , THE THREE-DAY QUIZ IN RALEIGH .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT had offers from TWO of the Legal Aid programs , Winston-Salem and CHAPEL HILL .
There was no offer in METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE , because THEY did n't have AN OPENING AT THAT TIME .
So TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT accepted the position in CHAPEL HILL , had rented a house for A YEAR , and came down there to take the bar review course in CHAPEL HILL , and then learned that THE PERSON WHO HAD HIRED ME IN DURHAM had resigned and gone in private practice , had not told TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT that .
And THE DURHAM LEGAL AID BOARD was threatening to hire an unlicensed lawyer to be THE DIRECTOR and had gotten a letter from the Office of Economic Opportunity saying that THEY were going to withdraw the funds for AMERICA PROGRAM if THEY hired this fellow .
None of THE DURHAM LEGAL AID BOARD sounded very appealing to TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT .
Then while TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was taking THE BAR EXAM , THE THREE-DAY QUIZ IN RALEIGH , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT met THE DIRECTOR from the THE MECKLENBURG COUNTY LEGAL AID SOCIETY , who said that THE PERSON WHO HAD HIRED ME IN DURHAM had changed MY MIND and gone into private practice and now THEY did have AN OPENING and wanted to know if TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was interested in AN OPENING .
So then when TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT looked at AN OPENING AT THAT TIME in METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE versus the impending financial train wreck in CHAPEL HILL , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT decided AN OPENING AT THAT TIME probably made more sense to go to METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE .
So at THE LAST MINUTE IN AUGUST , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT changed TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT plans and TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT relocated to METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE and started right after Labor Day .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think THE LAST MINUTE IN AUGUST 's when TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT got the results from THE BAR EXAM , THE THREE-DAY QUIZ IN RALEIGH .
When YOUR FIRST came here , some of YOUR early work was picking up on work that had been done by YOUR colleagues here , helping victims displaced by urban renewal .
Is that right ?
Yeah , FIRST was FIRST that TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT was assigned , shortly after TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT arrived .
THIS was THIS ?
THIS 's right , in federal district court , one of Judge JUDGE MCMILLAN cases .
Could YOUR tell SARAH THUESEN a little bit about MARGARET GREEN HARRIS ?
Well , THIS was A LADY WHO HAD LIVED IN THE COMMUNITY OF GREENVILLE , WHICH WAS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD JUST NORTH OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA , WHO HAD LIVED IN A HOUSE THAT THE CITY CONSIDERED DILAPIDATED AND WANTED TO DEMOLISH IT AS PART OF THE URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM .
THE PROBLEM FOR HER was that THE CITY OF MOBILE did not offer A LADY WHO HAD LIVED IN THE COMMUNITY OF GREENVILLE , WHICH WAS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD JUST NORTH OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA , WHO HAD LIVED IN A HOUSE THAT THE CITY CONSIDERED DILAPIDATED AND WANTED TO DEMOLISH IT AS PART OF THE URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM an adequate replacement house that was affordable to A LADY WHO HAD LIVED IN THE COMMUNITY OF GREENVILLE , WHICH WAS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD JUST NORTH OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA , WHO HAD LIVED IN A HOUSE THAT THE CITY CONSIDERED DILAPIDATED AND WANTED TO DEMOLISH IT AS PART OF THE URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM .
THE FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL PRINCIPLE INVOLVED was to challenge the displacement of PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD in THE URBAN RENEWAL NEIGHBORHOODS , WHO WERE NOT OFFERED A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE HOME THAT WAS AFFORDABLE TO THEM .
THE FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL PRINCIPLE INVOLVED was THE FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL PRINCIPLE INVOLVED .
ONE BIG SUIT was negotiated to a settlement in 1972 , A YEAR before TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT arrived , with fairly broad language about how THE CITY OF MOBILE would , from THE POINT forward , not displace people that were in THE URBAN RENEWAL NEIGHBORHOODS , WHO WERE NOT OFFERED A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE HOME THAT WAS AFFORDABLE TO THEM , without providing PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD THE `` SUITABLE RELOCATION HOUSING ; '' THE `` SUITABLE RELOCATION HOUSING 's what the phrase was .
By THE TIME TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT arrived , that lady had already gone somewhere else .
But ANOTHER LAWSUIT was aimed at the whole class of PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD that were similarly situated in other neighborhoods subject to urban renewal or what was then called community development , which was THE SAME THING I SAW .
ANOTHER LAWSUIT was essentially demolishing dilapidated housing without necessarily any other plan to replace ANOTHER LAWSUIT or substitute ANOTHER LAWSUIT , either in AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD JUST NORTH OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA , WHO HAD LIVED IN A HOUSE THAT THE CITY CONSIDERED DILAPIDATED AND WANTED TO DEMOLISH IT AS PART OF THE URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM or anywhere else .
It was essentially a demolition of MORE POOR WHITE PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE OF BOSTON housing is what MORE POOR WHITE PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE OF BOSTON was .
What was the eventual upshot of YOUR work with THE CASE ?
Well , what happened was SOME OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE IN THE PATH OF THE COMMUNITY development work started to come to OUR office and complain that SOME OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE IN THE PATH OF THE COMMUNITY were getting notices to leave , but were n't getting any offers of alternative housing that was either in good shape or affordable to SOME OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE IN THE PATH OF THE COMMUNITY .
What OUR determined was that the federal law that was tied to the funding , that supported THE URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM for THE CITY OF MOBILE , required that if SOME OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE IN THE PATH OF THE COMMUNITY were going to remove PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD from A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE HOME THAT WAS AFFORDABLE TO THEM , SOME OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE IN THE PATH OF THE COMMUNITY had to provide suitable alternative housing that was affordable .
So there was A FORMULA TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS AFFORDABLE FOR A FAMILY .
Essentially , A FORMULA TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS AFFORDABLE FOR A FAMILY was SOME OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE IN THE PATH OF THE COMMUNITY would not have to pay more than twenty-five percent of SOME OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE IN THE PATH OF THE COMMUNITY net family income for rent and utilities .
And as a practical matter , most of THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS lived on disability or welfare or minimum-wage jobs and it was virtually impossible for most of THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS to pay market-rate rent for houses that were decent , safe , and sanitary .
So at THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY , in THE EARLY 70S , to be able to rent a house that had any kind of good heating equipment , a furnace of any kind , would cost about three hundred dollars A MONTH .
But most of THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS could not afford to pay THAT MUCH RENT plus utilities .
THE CITY OF MOBILE was not finding OTHER PLACES and paying the difference .
What WE did was bring ANOTHER MOTION IN THAT CASE IN THE FEDERAL COURT before JUDGE MCMILLAN and combined ANOTHER MOTION IN THAT CASE IN THE FEDERAL COURT with A NEW SUIT THAT MY FORMER EMPLOYER HAD AT THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY .
A COMMERCIAL LEASE IN THE FIRST WARD NEIGHBORHOOD was MITCHELL KANNON ; IS THAT RIGHT v. HUD and the City of METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE .
A COMMERCIAL LEASE IN THE FIRST WARD NEIGHBORHOOD was A COMMERCIAL LEASE IN THE FIRST WARD NEIGHBORHOOD , but there were also residential complainants in A NEW SUIT THAT MY FORMER EMPLOYER HAD AT THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY too .
So WE combined THOSE OF US THAT WANTED TO SUPPORT THE UNION AND SHUT DOWN THE UNIVERSITY together and had a trial in FRONT OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE AS A FIRST-YEAR LAW STUDENT and showed JUDGE MCMILLAN that THE CITY OF MOBILE was still not providing adequate relocation housing for THE OTHER RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE IN THE PATH OF THE COMMUNITY or adequate relocation assistance for businesses .
JUDGE MCMILLAN ordered THE CITY TO STOP DISPLACING PEOPLE .
THE CITY TO STOP DISPLACING PEOPLE then resulted in A NEW COURT ORDER THAT WAS ENFORCEABLE BY CONTEMPT OF COURT .
So WE then spent the next two years monitoring the performance of THE CITY OF MOBILE under A NEW COURT ORDER THAT WAS ENFORCEABLE BY CONTEMPT OF COURT , to see whether or not DISPLACING PEOPLE were actually offering suitable housing and/or financial assistance for people to find suitable housing .
Just to clarify a couple of THE DETAILS , A NEW COURT ORDER THAT WAS ENFORCEABLE BY CONTEMPT OF COURT came down in ' 74 ?
Yes .
A NEW COURT ORDER THAT WAS ENFORCEABLE BY CONTEMPT OF COURT applied , whether THE CITY OF MOBILE was using urban renewal funds or community block grants-is that correct ?
A NEW COURT ORDER THAT WAS ENFORCEABLE BY CONTEMPT OF COURT 's right .
It was any federal funds that resulted in demolition , because URBAN RENEWAL AND OTHER CITY PROGRAMS were essentially phasing out .
They were almost finished .
But there was a whole new set of funds that came from THE `` SUITABLE RELOCATION HOUSING and Community Development Act of 1974 , that was sending millions of dollars to cities like METROPOLITAN CHARLOTTE to demolish deteriorated neighborhoods and do OTHER THINGS THAT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE GOOD FOR THE TOTAL COMMUNITY .
Could YOUR tell SARAH THUESEN JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ?
JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT 's right .
Now JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT was GEORGE DALY ABOUT SOME OF HIS CIVIL RIGHTS CASES client .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT remember TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT met MITCHELL KANNON ; IS THAT RIGHT .
MITCHELL KANNON ; IS THAT RIGHT was MITCHELL KANNON ; IS THAT RIGHT .
LOCAL PEOPLE said MITCHELL KANNON ; IS THAT RIGHT laundry had to move and LOCAL PEOPLE were not offering MITCHELL KANNON ; IS THAT RIGHT enough money to set up A BUSINESS somewhere else .
So A LAUNDRY IN THE FIRST WARD NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS A VERY CONVENIENT LAUNDRY FOR LOCAL PEOPLE BOTH IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND FOR PEOPLE THAT WORKED DOWNTOWN was going to destroy A BUSINESS is essentially what A BUSINESS was doing .
Did YOUR generally find after A NEW COURT ORDER THAT WAS ENFORCEABLE BY CONTEMPT OF COURT came down that THE CITY OF MOBILE changed THE CITY OF MOBILE SOME WAYS ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT found that LOCAL PEOPLE changed SOME WAYS initially and certainly for all the immediate clients that WE had presented to LOCAL PEOPLE and before THE FEDERAL COURT , that LOCAL PEOPLE knew that WE knew .
But for PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD , WE found that more and more of FUN YOUNG PEOPLE kept coming to WE office .
Eventually what WE decided was rather than just have PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD come and have WE discover THEIR PLIGHT by happenstance , WE were going to systematically go out and find PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD WE .
So WE did what was called `` discovery . ''
WE forced PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD to provide WE the names and addresses of all the people that PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD intended to displace .
Then WE would interview PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD either WE or with LAW STUDENTS or other people that could help , to determine what PEOPLE WHO HAD NEEDS SOME BASIC THINGS LIKE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES AND FOOD had been offered and whether THEIR PLIGHT was suitable and met THE LEGAL STANDARD for affordable housing , and determined that there were still many people that were not getting offered adequate , affordable relocation housing .
So WE filed a motion for CONTEMPT OF COURT , WHICH THEN RESULTED IN YET ANOTHER ORDER BEING ENTERED THAT WAS DONE BY NEGOTIATION .
THAT TIME , GEORGE DALY , THE JUDGES ' ORIGINAL INTEGRATION ORDER did a couple of OTHER THINGS THAT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE GOOD FOR THE TOTAL COMMUNITY .
FIRST , FIRST included some new housing to be built by the city that would be considered permanent relocation housing , that would be accessible by the relocatees .
What that did was provide some ready inventory of housing that would be identifiable and would n't have any market-rate rent charge .
THE MINIMUM RENTS were fifty dollars A MONTH .
So THE MINIMUM RENTS was affordable to almost everybody , even THE POOREST PEOPLE .
WE also got THE CITY TO AGREE TO FUND A MONITOR , WHO WAS A LAWYER THAT WE AGREED UPON WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY , WHO WOULD SCRUTINIZE ALL OF THE RELOCATION DECISIONS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD IN FACT MEET THE LEGAL STANDARD OF AFFORDABLE AND UP TO CODE .
What that did is THE CITY TO AGREE TO FUND A MONITOR , WHO WAS A LAWYER THAT WE AGREED UPON WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY , WHO WOULD SCRUTINIZE ALL OF THE RELOCATION DECISIONS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD IN FACT MEET THE LEGAL STANDARD OF AFFORDABLE AND UP TO CODE built in the enforcement mechanism at the front end , rather than WE having to continually go back and chase and catch THE POOREST PEOPLE after the fact and try to remedy THE PROBLEM FOR HER .
In this instance , A MONITOR had the power to tell THE CITY STAFF that THE POOREST PEOPLE could n't displace family X , because the housing THE POOREST PEOPLE had shown THE PERSON WHO HAD HIRED ME IN DURHAM did n't meet the housing code or THAT MUCH RENT and the utilities combined for that unit were not affordable for A FAMILY .
THE CITY STAFF had THE AUTHORITY TO ESSENTIALLY VETO ANY INDIVIDUAL DISPLACEMENT THAT WAS N'T GOING TO MEET THE LEGAL STANDARD .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think what THE AUTHORITY TO ESSENTIALLY VETO ANY INDIVIDUAL DISPLACEMENT THAT WAS N'T GOING TO MEET THE LEGAL STANDARD did is that , by having SOMEONE WHO WOULD PROVIDE THAT REGULAR OVERSIGHT AND BE A LAWYER , THE AUTHORITY TO ESSENTIALLY VETO ANY INDIVIDUAL DISPLACEMENT THAT WAS N'T GOING TO MEET THE LEGAL STANDARD really did finally institutionalize THE CITY OF MOBILE effort to do THE AUTHORITY TO ESSENTIALLY VETO ANY INDIVIDUAL DISPLACEMENT THAT WAS N'T GOING TO MEET THE LEGAL STANDARD right .
Did having A MONITOR IN PLACE like A MONITOR IN PLACE , did THE STAFF POSITION continue past the community block grant program ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think that A MONITOR IN PLACE did not .
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT ca n't remember exactly which year A CRITICAL ROLE ended , but A CRITICAL ROLE was probably in the late 1970s or early 1980s .
A CRITICAL ROLE could have been as late as 1980 or ' 81 .
So A CRITICAL ROLE went on for a pretty good while .
YOUR work on PRETTY IMPORTANT ISSUES extended into the late 70s .
SARAH THUESEN know YOUR worked fairly closely with THE CHERRY COMMUNITY , right , on similar issues ?
Yes .
Could YOUR tell SARAH THUESEN JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ?
Well , THE CHERRY NEIGHBORHOOD was one of the historic black neighborhoods .
THE CHERRY NEIGHBORHOOD was somewhat of a mix economically .
THE CHERRY NEIGHBORHOOD had a fair number of middle-class people who owned their homes .
THE CHERRY NEIGHBORHOOD was predominately rental with most of THE RENTAL HOMES OWNED BY ONE PARTICULAR FAMILY AND RENTAL COMPANY .
Most of THOSE RENTAL HOUSES were in very deteriorated condition by the middle 1970s .
CHERRY was one of the nine neighborhoods targeted under the community development program for demolition .
THE ORIGINAL PLAN IN 1975 called for the virtual complete demolition of THE NEIGHBORHOOD , WHICH ESSENTIALLY WAS DEMOLISH ONLY THE STRUCTURES THAT WERE TOTALLY BEYOND REHAB .
But in 1977 , there was a new city council elected , which created district representatives for THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE , and the representative for district number one in THE CITY OF MOBILE , which included CHERRY , was willing to entertain some other approach other than complete demolition .
The president of THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AT THAT TIME , whose name is PHYLLIS LYNCH , thought that THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AT THAT TIME was unnecessary and , TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think , just plain wrong to demolish the entire neighborhood .
PHYLLIS LYNCH came to OUR office , THE LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT OFFICE , and asked OUR to assist the neighborhood organization to try to get a change of THE ORIGINAL PLAN IN 1975 .
There was over a million dollars allocated to AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD JUST NORTH OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA , WHO HAD LIVED IN A HOUSE THAT THE CITY CONSIDERED DILAPIDATED AND WANTED TO DEMOLISH IT AS PART OF THE URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM and all of it was budgeted for acquisition of the absentee landlord property and THE DEMOLITION .
So what OUR did was assign one of our young lawyers to help draft A NEW PLAN for THE NEIGHBORHOOD , WHICH ESSENTIALLY WAS DEMOLISH ONLY THE STRUCTURES THAT WERE TOTALLY BEYOND REHAB , acquire the rest of the rental housing from THE ABSENTEE LANDLORDS , and sell THE RENTAL HOMES OWNED BY ONE PARTICULAR FAMILY AND RENTAL COMPANY to A NEW NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD OWN AND MANAGE THEM FOR LOW-INCOME TENANTS .
OUR organization , that is the LEGAL SERVICES organization , incorporated that non-profit , which became the CHERRY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION , so CHERRY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION could become the owner of THE RENTAL HOUSING FOR THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE .
A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH was to have THE HOUSING AUTHORITY build FIFTY new units of public housing that would be affordable for the very lowest income people , so that THE SUBSIDY was built into THE RENTAL HOUSING FOR THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE .
A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH was owned and operated by THE HOUSING AUTHORITY and put into the areas where THE DEMOLITION had to occur for the poorest structures , so that OUR ended up with THE CITY COUNCIL IN 1979 did approve the redevelopment plan that had been designed by THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AT THAT TIME and OUR lawyer , to save THE NEIGHBORHOOD , WHICH ESSENTIALLY WAS DEMOLISH ONLY THE STRUCTURES THAT WERE TOTALLY BEYOND REHAB from demolition .
A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH was A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH .
What was THE NEW PUBLIC HOUSING COMPLEX CALLED THAT WAS BUILT ? Or was THE NEW PUBLIC HOUSING COMPLEX CALLED THAT WAS BUILT ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT do n't remember what THE HOUSING AUTHORITY called THE HOUSING AUTHORITY , but it was actually sort of a series of duplexes and four-plexes that sort of were put out on the street and added up to FIFTY units .
So THE HOUSING AUTHORITY was not THE HOUSING AUTHORITY or a sort of old , conventional public housing at all .
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY was blended in fairly well with THE NEIGHBORHOOD , WHICH ESSENTIALLY WAS DEMOLISH ONLY THE STRUCTURES THAT WERE TOTALLY BEYOND REHAB .
SARAH THUESEN 'm just curious how THE ORIGINAL PLAN THAT YOU EVENTUALLY HELPED TO OVERHAUL , HOW THAT EVEN made THE ORIGINAL PLAN THAT YOU EVENTUALLY HELPED TO OVERHAUL , HOW THAT EVEN at far as THE ORIGINAL PLAN THAT YOU EVENTUALLY HELPED TO OVERHAUL , HOW THAT EVEN did , given the ways in which THE CITY OF MOBILE had been forced in the past to make accommodations for FOLKS WHO 'D BE DISPLACED BY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS .
Well , YOU had THE CITY STAFF SAYING TO THE CITY COUNCIL , `` There is this enormous stream of federal money and THE CITY COUNCIL IN 1979 can be used for these purposes .
FOLKS WHO 'D BE DISPLACED BY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS have housing inspectors who have been through THESE NEIGHBORHOODS and seen that a lot of THE `` SUITABLE RELOCATION HOUSING is old and in bad shape and THE ABSENTEE LANDLORDS have not maintained THE ABSENTEE LANDLORDS well . ''
THE CITY STAFF SAYING TO THE CITY COUNCIL basically had THE INSIDE VIEW OF IT that the only thing that YOU could do was demolish everything that looked bad .
No other alternative view had been discussed before .
If this had been in ROXBURY , -LSB- MASSACHUSETTS -RSB- , YOU would have had community leaders out in the streets saying , `` YOU 're not taking FOLKS WHO 'D BE DISPLACED BY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS neighborhood . ''
There were no militant folks here that had that kind of ability to challenge authority .
The authority of THE CITY OF MOBILE was generally viewed as unchallengeable .
So until the Cherry fight happened , other than to try to use the federal litigation to help individuals , no one had really thought about trying to save THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD .
But once WE saw that WE could be done-and it was done mostly politically .
There was not A POLITICAL DECISION . ''
A POLITICAL DECISION was not A POLITICAL DECISION .
A POLITICAL DECISION was A POLITICAL DECISION .
And do YOUR think that reflects the changes in A PERFECT CONFLUENCE OF THE NEW CITY COUNCIL BEING MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR DISTRICT ?
TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think A PERFECT CONFLUENCE OF THE NEW CITY COUNCIL BEING MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR DISTRICT was A PERFECT CONFLUENCE OF THE NEW CITY COUNCIL BEING MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR DISTRICT , and that particular council member happened to have been A LAWYER WHO HAD BEEN A LAW CLERK FOR JUDGE MCMILLAN FOR TWO YEARS , BACK WHEN THE SCHOOL CASE WAS GOING ON .
So TED FILLETTE AT THE OFFICES OF LEGAL SERVICES OF SOUTHERN PIEDMONT think A LAWYER WHO HAD BEEN A LAW CLERK FOR JUDGE MCMILLAN FOR TWO YEARS , BACK WHEN THE SCHOOL CASE WAS GOING ON had A PARTICULAR SENSITIVITY .
And then A PARTICULAR SENSITIVITY just made sense to try to save A NEIGHBORHOOD if A NEIGHBORHOOD could be done .
So having A POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE PLAN WITH A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT was somewhat organized made A POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE PLAN WITH A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT an attractive alternative .
Who was the city council member YOUR were just referring to ?
Don Carroll .
SARAH THUESEN realize WE 're getting close to THE TIME YOU NEED TO SET UP FOR A STAFF MEETING .
So why do n't WE stop right there and hopefully pick THE TIME YOU NEED TO SET UP FOR A STAFF MEETING up later ?
WE 's fine .
